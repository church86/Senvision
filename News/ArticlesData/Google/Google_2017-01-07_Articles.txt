The good news? You may actually love it. Smart Home by Rich Brown January 8, 2017 2:18 PM PST @rh_brown Up Next Amazon could start dropping off packages inside your home Yes, Alexa is everywhere. You have only to look at our CES 2017 Smart Home Scoreboard to see how Amazon has married its virtual assistant to cars, refrigerators, televisions and robots. Alexa's momentum isn't surprising given the amount of hype over the last year. For Alexa's competition, Google Assistant is still new as a smart home assistant, and Apple is sticking to its slow-burn approach to growing Siri and its iOS HomeKit platform. That's why our Scoreboard has a loose quality breakdown. I didn't want to simply hand Amazon a prize for supporting yet another smart plug. Alexa takes form at CES 2017.Photo by Chris Monroe/CNET Hopefully also evident from the Scoreboard (or, perhaps, "smart home potential meter") is the breadth of categories in which you will now find these voice assistants. That expansion will help transform the experience from its current Internet of Things grab bag -- the junk drawer full of connected motion sensors, thermostats and light switches -- to a more pervasive experience that will follow us wherever we go (for better or worse). Done right, and our lives become easier and safer, with more time for the things we truly care about. Implemented carelessly, this new connected world will threaten our notions of privacy and personal safety. The reality will ultimately land somewhere in the middle. That outcome will be shaped by what we saw in Las Vegas this past week. Here are the highlights. Ford is first to bring Alexa into the passenger seat Alexa's road trip with Ford brings the cloud a little closer to your car. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 1:48 Close Drag Automotive This is the category I was most interested to see at this year's show. Ford and Toyota both hinted at bringing Alexa to their respective in-car experiences at 2016's CES, and this year Ford delivered. I sat with my colleagues Wayne Cunningham and Ben Fox Rubin inside a Ford C-Max while a company representative demonstrated using Amazon's increasingly ubiquitous voice-command assistant, but the experience was underwhelming. The car was parked inside the Las Vegas Convention Center. The software is still in beta so not every command worked well. Ford had no smart home stuff for Alexa to control. Hyundai and Chrysler had Google Home and Google Assistant integrations of their own here at the show, too. Chrysler's was just a concept. Hyundai lets you ask Google Home to start your car, flash the lights, or provide directions to your house, and then send the route to your in-car navigation system. Handy, but not the same as dictating commands to your home from the inside of your car. But regardless of this somewhat halting start on the ground in Vegas, that's exactly what's happening: Tell your home to crank up the air conditioner, start the coffee brewing and raise the garage door -- all from the comfort of the driver's or passenger seat. It will eliminate driving a car as a weak point in the chain of control over your home -- but it'll also add another set of in-car distractions. Nvidia Shield gets Amazon video, improved gaming and Google Assistant The all-new, do-it-all video box gets a bunch of improvements and keeps the same $200 price (which converts to £161 or AU$272). by David Katzmaier 2:09 Close Drag Home entertainment Centralizing voice and smart home around the TV is utterly obvious, and yet somehow no one has combined all of the pieces into a single, unified product. Shame on Samsung in particular, who is best positioned to do this given its Alexa-supporting SmartThings division, and yet somehow has not. Related link To see how all of this works together, check out our Ultimate Smart Home Compatibility Guide Nvidia's new Shield TV streamer doesn't have a screen, but it might be the best solution when it ships on January 16. It brings gaming, video streaming, SmartThings compatibility (via extra $30 dongle -- converted to £24 or AU$41), and always-listening voice help from a remote that works with Google Assistant. No other streaming device, not even Apple TV, offers that same combination of smart home control with an always-listening voice assistant to control your home entertainment. A trio of budget TV brands -- Element, Seiki and Westinghouse -- also made some voice control progress. Their new televisions have Amazon's Fire TV service built-in, and they included the same voice remote that lets you use Alexa to turn on the TV, change inputs, change channels, and navigate among the usual assortment of streaming services. Logitech's Harmony remotes and the Amazon Fire TV also bring Alexa to your TV, but built-in methods are usually easier and cheaper. It will take deeper integration between products to truly marry your smart home and your television. My near-term holy grail (besides verbally flipping channels) remains a video doorbell feed transmitted automatically to your TV with two-way audio support when someone comes to your front door. Maybe next year. Also: Don't sleep on the cable companies and other service providers who have entered the smart home field. Comcast in particular is taking this market very seriously. LG's see-through smart fridge takes the CES stage It just wouldn't be CES without touchscreen smart refrigerators -- and this year, LG brought one with Alexa built right in. by Ry Crist 1:02 Close Drag Kitchen and appliances Samsung promised it would add Alexa to the touchscreen-equipped Family Hub refrigerator at CES last year. This year LG beat Samsung to the punch. On the whole, LG's Smart Instaview fridge feels like a copycat product to Samsung's Family Hub, from the touchscreen and its various home organization and shopping apps to the cameras inside that let you view the contents remotely. LG's Instaview gimmick is unique -- knock on the screen and it goes translucent, letting you look inside that way, too. Incorporating Alexa into a multi-thousand dollar refrigerator doesn't seem to get you anything different than plunking down a $50 Echo Dot. Still, I wonder if putting Alexa in a fridge won't make Amazon's shopping services (including Amazon Fresh groceries) feel a little more immediate when you're staring into it wondering what to make for dinner. As for Samsung, Alexa has fallen out of favor as a voice assistant. Alexa never came to Family Hub 1.0. The 2.0 version, announced this week, will come with unspecified "advanced voice technology." Is it Samsung's old S-Talk Android voice recognition? Is this what Samsung has in mind for its new voice acquisition, Viv? Samsung gave no specifics during its presentation nor would its US appliance division exec, John Herrington, comment when I asked him directly. For the rest of the appliance landscape, small appliance maker Gourmia brought Alexa to an entire suite of countertop gadgets. Whirlpool and GE rolled out Alexa integrations across their large appliances, with special Alexa-specific commands like preheating the oven, or asking how much time is left on a dishwasher cycle. Not as flashy as a touchscreen on a fridge, but certainly more practical. Hands on with Kuri -- an adorable wandering security cam Imagine if you had a cartoon character roaming your floors, watching your kids and telling them stories -- that's Kuri. by Andrew Gebhart 1:40 Close Drag Home assistants The list of either static or mobile home companion devices was surprisingly robust this year. Two stand out. Among the flood of baby and parenting-focused tech, Mattel's Aristotle is one of the most ambitious thanks to its split personality. Yes, it's another smart speaker with Alexa built into it. But prompt it with "Hey, Aristotle" instead, and you or your kids engage its alter-ego. Among Aristotle's tricks, it can sing a baby back to sleep, read from a list of books, play games. It even has a manners option that requires your kids to say "please" before it will acknowledge a request. If that's not enough, it also comes with a camera for keeping an eye on your kid's room, a bracelet option to help track if your child has completed his or her chores, and of course, the ability to trigger sound effects with compatible Mattel toys. Real-world parents, presumably, are sitting in the next room with their feet up while Aristotle doles out the life lessons. Kuri, from Mayfield Robotics, looks like a refugee from Pixar's "WALL-E." It seems to have its own voice control tech (other robots use Alexa). But most importantly, it's got a ton of charm. Cute-eyed Kuri will toddle along on the floor, patrolling the halls with its camera. It an play music and podcasts, tell you the weather, and even, supposedly, recognize faces. I'm skeptical of the market for free roaming bots that aren't vacuums. The utility doesn't seem to be there yet to sway city dwellers to let a floor drone mess up the already cramped flow of a 1,000 square foot apartment. But years ago, Sony's Aibo showed that consumers can fall in love with a robot. For those with the square footage to spare, Kuri looks to have that kind of appeal. 57 Check out all the smart home products at CES 2017 (so far) Apple's long smart home shadow Alongside these larger trends, the more traditional smart home hardware -- lights, switches, locks -- were present here too. If you didn't hear much from Apple and its HomeKit smart home service at the show, it's because most of its news centered on these kinds of products, which aren't as flashy as cars and fridges and robots. Apple expanded its reach this year, as usual, via its partners, who introduced cameras, security systems, and, finally, a Chamberlain garage door opener to its platform. That's all new stuff that will make HomeKit even more capable. The big question for Apple remains whether it will bring out its own Echo or Google Home competitor to add a truly seamless voice companion to the home environment. Until that happens, or until Apple introduces a better alternative, I suspect HomeKit won't benefit as much from the present hype surrounding voice control at home. That may not matter in the long run. It's still morning in the smart home. But it won't be forever.

Since the smartphone has already been upgraded to the Android 7.0 Nougat software, the new update is based on the latest version of Google's mobile OS. On the OnePlus forums page, OxygenOS staff member Tony L. announced on Saturday that an OTA update has arrived for the OnePlus 3. He also revealed that the rollout of OxygenOS 4.0.1 is going to be incremental, but he didn’t reveal the reason why this is so. Tony simply noted that only a small percentage of OnePlus 3 owners are getting update notifications this weekend and a broader release of the update is expected to happen in a few days. For the Android Nougat changes, users can expect to see new notifications design and a new Settings menu design. Multi-window view has also been added to the flagship handset, along with the notification direct reply feature and the custom DPI support. The status bar has been upgraded with more icon options as well. The staff member did not forget to mention the improved shelf customization, increased system stability and updated APN settings. Aside from bringing something new to the table, OxygenOS 4.0.1 also addresses a couple of known issues in the software of the device. For example, the bug that’s causing proximity sensor errors during calls has been quashed, as per PhoneArena. The problem with apps not downloading properly from the Play Store has also been singled out in Tony’s update. When apps do not download from Google’s Play Store, the OnePlus dev suggests users should check Google’s troubleshooting steps or try switching on the Battery Saving Mode as well as resetting the Play Store app preferences. For users who are complaining about downloading issues while connected to Data Roaming access, Tony said this is a known Google issue. For other cases like fluctuating WiFi connection and mobile data problems, Tony stated in his post that owners should directly send him a private message for faster and more reliable feedback. For APN-related mobile data issues, the OxygenOS developer wrote that users should alter the APN settings and try all the options there as much as possible.

Jump to navigation Login Register Home Car Reviews Car News Video Opinion Detroit Motor Show 6 issues for £1 Leasing Newsletter Google's Waymo to develop self-driving cars with established car makers But technology firm reserves right to use its self-developed software and hardware on its own automotive products too Waymo Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid self-driving prototype Google's Firefly self-driving prototype Close by Jim Holder 8 January 2017 Follow @@Jim_Holder Google offshoot Waymo will focus its efforts on creating software and hardware for self-driving cars, developing it for use with established car makers but reserving the right to also use it for its own projects if it decides it is necessary. The announcement was made during a presentation on the eve of the Detroit motor show by John Krafcik, CEO of Google’s self-driving car team and the former head of Hyundai North America, during which he highlighted the firm’s existing deals with the Fiat Chrysler Group and Honda to work on future projects. Google's Waymo self-driving company announced Outlining some of the motivations for developing the technology, and the landmark achievements of the eight-year-old project so far, Krafcik reiterated that Waymo was only interested in developing so-called Level 4 autonomy - essentially fully autonomous cars that can operate without a driver or steering wheel and pedals. “Each year more than 1.2m people die on roads - that’s the equivalent of a Boeing 737 falling from the sky every hour of every day all year long," said Krafcik, highlighting what he perceived as the shortcomings of current cars and the issues Waymo is looking to solve. “Then there are the people who can’t drive - 20m in the USA alone. Plus, we spend an average of 50 minutes a day commuting - that’s the equivalent of 162 lifetimes wasted per day. Then there’s the fact an average car sits idle 94% of the time.” Last year, in Austin, Texas, a Google car undertook what Krafcik claimed was the world’s first truly driverless journey, in one of the Google self-driving prototypes - nicknamed Firefly - with no steering wheel and no driver. However, he said Waymo’s co-operation with the FCA Group - and specifically in developing and building 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid models in just under six months ready for road testing later in January 2017 - would create a watershed moment in development. “Where Firefly was limited to 25mph, these vehicles can be tested on all roads and in more road conditions,” said Krafcik.  Is the Google car in trouble? Highlighting some of the technological advances Waymo has made as it has developed its own software and hardware, rather than relying on bought-in technology, Krafcik pointed out how Google’s own Lidar system cost less than 10% of the $75,000 dollars of a bought-in unit a few years ago, adding that it was also technologically more advanced. “The goal is to make this technology accessible to millions of people,” he added. To date, Waymo Firefly vehicles have driven 2.5 million miles autonomously - equivalent to 300 years of typical human driving - and Krafcik stressed that testing was ramping up fast, with it taking the firm six years to cover its first million miles but just eight months to cover the most recent million miles. In addition, Waymo covers more than one billion miles of testing in its simulator each year. It’s on-road testing in California has also suffered substantially less autonomous-related incidents in the past year, with the “disengaged” incident rate falling from 0.8 times per 1000 to 0.2. “We believe we’re at an inflection point where we can start to see the benefit of this technology,” concluded Krafcik. “We can see uses for a car that drives itself at the push of a button across personal transport, ride hailing, logistical transport and last-mile transport services - but we also see potential to create truly exciting new uses too. “We know there’s a better way. An 'almost self-driving car' won’t cut it. We’re thinking beyond a single-use business model. We’re bringing to market a self-driving platform that makes getting around safely easy for everyone. Some projects we may do alone and some we may do with partners. We’re mastering hardware and software to build a better driver for a fully self-driving car.” Click here to read the latest on Apple's self-driving car project Reports - Apple is no longer building its own self-driving car Tweet Widget Facebook Like Google Plus One Tweet Widget Facebook Like Google Plus One Our Verdict Honda Civic The Honda Civic is an impressive achievement and a worthy rival to the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus, but it isn't quite up to class-leading standards Join the debate Comments 1 ammythomas21 ammythomas21 9 January 2017 My mothers neighbour is working part time and averaging $9000 a month.

Android and iOS both have smart photo services built in nowadays, but what happens when you want to jump from one to the other? Here's what you need to know. In this guide we'll be tackling the challenge of moving your whole photo library from one service to the other: this is a full traded-in-my-iPhone-for-a-Pixel scenario, a clean break where you're switching from Apple Photos to Google Photos or back the other way. Image: Google For a lot of people it might be better to have a foot in both camps, at least for some photos or for some of the time, but for simplicity's sake we won't go into every possible scenario here. You can in fact use these services alongside each other pretty easily, but in this case we'll tackle going from one to the other wholesale. It's also worth noting these are not exactly directly comparable services, with Apple's photo offerings very much baked into its hardware and software, and Google Photos very much web-first and operating independently of your computers, phones and tablets. Switching from Apple Photos to Google Photos Before you jump to Google Photos you need to decide if you want to store your photos (and videos) at their original resolution or whether you're happy to put up with some resizing — images are stored at a maximum of 16 megapixels and videos are stored at a maximum of 1080p HD. If you choose the second option, you can store as much as you want, for free. If you want to keep everything as it is, you need to think about paying for Google Drive storage, as you only get 15GB for free. Prices start at 100GB for $US1.99 ($3) a month. Once you've decided, you need to work out where your photos are, and given the different apps on macOS and iOS, and the recent upgrades to both, you could be forgiven for not being too sure. Thankfully, Google Photos isn't too fussed. Download the Google Photos desktop client for macOS and mobile app for iOS and both will get to work picking up all the pictures from your computers and iDevices. The desktop app asks which photo libraries you want to back up when you start it, and the iOS app simply backs up everything it can find. The only images and videos that might get missed are those you've uploaded to iCloud and deleted from your devices, if you're using iCloud. To get these files back on macOS, launch Photos, then open the Photos menu, choose Preferences, switch to iCloud and make sure Download Originals to Mac is selected. On iOS, if you have the space, open Settings then tap iCloud, Photos and Download and Keep Originals. If for whatever reason you can't get your iCloud photos back to a Mac or iOS device, the export options from iCloud on the web are a little less than stellar. Pictures can be downloaded individually easily enough, but for bulk downloads you have to use the Shift or Cmd keys to select multiple items at once, then click the download icon. Once saved somewhere, they can be uploaded to Google Photos using a desktop client or just your web browser. Switching from Google Photos to Apple Photos As we've said, Google Photos lives on the web, but getting all your pictures and videos back down again isn't too difficult — though it might take some time if you've got a massive photo library and a sluggish internet connection. With Apple Photos, you don't have to store your pictures in the cloud, but if you do then you'll probably need to pay for extra storage. The Google Photos desktop client for macOS doesn't have two-way sync, but the one for Google Drive does. First, go to Google Drive on the web, open the Settings page (via the cog icon) and tick the box marked Automatically put your Google Photos into a folder in My Drive under the General tab. That doesn't change anything about what's stored in Google Photos, it just makes everything visible in Google Drive. Then, download and install the macOS client for Google Drive, and make sure the Google Photos folder is selected in the list of folders to sync, which will be displayed during the setup process. Hey presto, all your photos and videos are pulled down from the cloud. In the Photos app on your Mac, pick File then Import to load in the newly downloaded content. It's only if you don't have a Mac computer to hand that difficulties arise — if you're using Apple's photo services solely on iPhones, iPads, and the web, maybe. If you have a Windows machine to hand, you can use the same trick as above to get the images and videos downloaded. Then, instead of running the Photos app on macOS, use iTunes and your iDevice, or just iCloud on the web, to get everything up to the iCloud Photo Library. Alternatively you can use the Google Takeout service to download all of your pictures and video from Google Photos if you don't want to go down the Google Drive syncing route. All of your stuff gets served up as a compressed folder which you can then extract and move to Apple's apps on the desktop, on mobile and in the cloud. A computer of some kind really is essential though as a stopgap between Google Photos and Apple's Photos apps, even if you're planning to use nothing but an iPhone and iCloud Photo Library for the rest of your life. In other words you can't go straight from cloud service to cloud service. Without investing too much time and effort you should be up and running on your new photo management system and ready to take and store pictures again — at least until you decide to switch to something new.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube When you talk with friends, everytime you want to bring up a topic you don’t have to go “Hey <name>” because that would be weird, right? This is why sometimes using voice assistant platforms like Google Assistant or Siri might be weird because you’ll always have to keep prompting it to activate it. However on Android TV, it has been noticed that Google Assistant has been upgraded where it can actually hold continuous conversations with its user. As you might have heard, Google Assistant is arriving on Android TV and the continuous conversation appears to be a few feature that will be part of it. Basically what this means is that Google Assistant will keep listening for a short while after your latest query in case there’s anything else that comes to mind. For example you might want to check the time and weather of a country that you’re visiting, so you could ask for the time and follow it up with the weather without having to go, “OK Google” to activate the second query. This is slightly different from follow-up questions in which you would still need to activate the AI through its keywords. We reckon there might be some who might be too comfortable with the fact that it’s still listening once the initial query has ended, so we have to wonder if there’s maybe a settings that allows you to turn it off. In the meantime you can check out the video above by Android Police to see the feature in action. Filed in Gadgets >General. Read more about android tv, Google and google assistant.

But those days are long gone, with many couples working full time, living far afield from friends and family and only on nodding terms with the neighbours. Social media pages for parents have sprung up to fill the void and while Facebook exchanges can be a source of useful information, support and entertainment, they can also turn nasty surprisingly quickly when posts go rogue.

More videos Twitter, Google, Facebook change policies Online media giants are changing their policies to combat bullying and improve accuracy. Emma Lovell, a businesswoman and mother-of-two from Queenscliff, was stunned by the level of aggression she witnessed in groups supposedly established to offer support. "I would see the most hurtful comments on Facebook every day," she says. "Women would say things to each other online they wouldn't dream of saying in a face to face conversation. They just vent." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Facebook group moderators are on alert for outbreaks of bad behaviour. Photo: Bloomberg Lovell became so disenchanted with the cyber hate she witnessed, she recently set up her own Facebook group, Mumsomnia, with the aim of encouraging women to meet face to face. RMIT University information technology lecturer John Lenarcic​ says social media can be a double edged-sword, providing great support but also fertile ground for bullying. Advertisement "It's almost like a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde world online," he says. "In real life people can be perfectly reasonable but online they can be completely hostile." Rachel Chappell​ was alert to this when she established the Facebook group North Shore Mums in 2012, hoping to make a few local connections as she was new to the area. Since then the group has grown to 20,000 members, publishing 200 new posts a day. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Rachel Chappell - with her children Zara, 4, Ella, 11 months, and Scarlett, 6 - started a group to help her make connections with other mums. Photo: Dallas Kilponen "Obviously, with so many members there are going to be differences of opinion," she says. "Ninety-nine per cent of the time people are supportive and respectful but the other 1 per cent can be quite nasty and we don't tolerate that. "The benefits of being able to share information and advice far outweigh the drawbacks of a small minority who just want to cause trouble." Facebook groups for parents have exploded over the past five years. There are groups for parents in specific locations as well as those with particular interests. Posts are as diverse as the membership, covering everything from domestic violence to where to find a reasonably-priced plumber. There are some topics guaranteed to spark heated debate  but even more prosaic subjects such as shopping centre car parks can get fingers tapping heatedly on keyboards. When Justine Slapp​ co-founded Hills District Mums in 2013 she wanted to connect a few hundred mums in Sydney's north west. The group now has 13,000 members, 2000 posts a week, 15,000 comments on those posts and 14 moderators.  "I was a real control freak in the early days," Slapp says. "I would get really nervous about what people were posting."  Slapp does not believe in shutting down debate and avoids deleting posts unless absolutely necessary. "People hate their posts or comments being deleted," she says. "You're taking away someone's voice; silencing them." For all the outbreaks of bad behaviour online, there are many more examples of generosity, according to Anita Vitanova​, who founded Inner West Mums in 2013. "Recently a mum posted that she didn't have a particular type of syringe she needed to give medication to her child," she says. "Another mum saw it, realised she had that type of syringe and drove it over to the poster." Vitanova has found many of Inner West Mums' 17,000 members post about non-child related topics. "When you are at home with a baby all day you do crave adult conversation," she says. "You see some really intelligent discussions on the group – it's not all about teething and where to get the best babycino." New to the Facebook mums' groups? Here's a list of landmines to watch out for. Tread carefully Feeding: Doesn't matter whether it's breast or bottle, this is guaranteed to spark lively debate. Method of delivery: Drug free with dolphin music and essential oils? In the bath at a birthing centre? At home? In an operating theatre? There are plenty of ways to have a baby and just as many opinions about it. Amber alert Education: Back in the day, choosing a school for your child was a simple affair. They either went to the local comprehensive high school or went private. Smart children went to selective schools. These days the choices seem endless and so are peoples' views on the matter. Paid work versus staying at home: Whether you've chosen to stop paid work to raise a family or raced straight back to the office, there's no easy answer. Life is complex and so is this question.  Sound the emergency signal Vaccines: A casual post about new research on immunisation can unleash a torrent of opinion, some informed, some not so much. Most groups have guidelines about health-related posts. Some automatically delete any posts about the false link between vaccines and autism.  Circumcision: As with many sensitive subjects, there's not a lot of middle ground on this one. One person's medical procedure is another person's child abuse.

But what about the obverse? As hardware upgrade cycles lengthen and computing paradigms undergo rapid transformation, how are the reigning tech giants pushing to keep their growth momentum going? In April 2015, Apple hit its highest ever market capitalization of $774 billion. It would have taken a brave man to bet against the firm Steve Jobs revived being the first to the fabled trillion-dollar market cap mark. But the tech industry is a fickle beast. Apple’s market cap now is $619 billion. That still makes it the leader of the pack by a distance, but it no longer appears as invincible as it once did. Ann Winblad, one of Silicon Valley’s reigning power brokers—a venture capitalist who has spent over three decades observing the industry from up close—has dismissed its chances of hitting a trillion dollars. She’d rather hang her hat on Google’s parent company, Alphabet, with a current market cap of $551 billion. Other analysts point to Microsoft, bouncing back from its long twilight, or Amazon, currently at $484 billion and $368 billion, respectively. The reason for Apple’s slowing down a touch isn’t particularly surprising in hindsight. Its meteoric climb was predicated on its being a personal computing company—one that built its brand around creating new product categories, delivering best-in-class products and a polished user experience. Here’s the thing: personal computing devices, from computers to smartphones, are good enough now to obviate the need for frequent upgrades. And just as Apple lapped Microsoft by creating the smartphone and tablet categories that contributed to the traditional personal computer industry dwindling, future growth in the tech industry will likely come from two areas where it lacks a qualitative edge. The first of these is cloud computing. The ability to rent on-demand processing power, storage and software online is, essentially, the equivalent of division of labour and labour specialization in conventional industries. It sidesteps the need for a great deal of capital expenditure. And it enables greater efficiency in resource allocation, allowing companies to upgrade capacity as and when needed, then scale down again. The potential is obvious. Amazon has an early mover advantage here notwithstanding its image as primarily an e-commerce company. It started Amazon Web Services a decade and more ago, originally intended for its own use but eventually made available to others. It has captured about a third of the market now, leaving Google and Microsoft far behind. The latter are moving to correct this; there is a reason Satya Nadella, formerly head of Microsoft’s cloud business, was made the Redmond giant’s chief executive. Microsoft, after all, reigned supreme in the enterprise space. This is a natural evolution—renting out computing power and software to companies instead of selling software to them. The second area is the linked spheres of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The battle to control homes as entire ecosystems—smart homes—is the most high-profile aspect of this. As daily devices from microwaves to refrigerators to cars become networked, there are two prerequisites for unlocking their full potential: intuitive ways to control them via natural language recognition and algorithms to analyse the constant stream of data from them and enable predictive behaviour and increased efficiency. Apple may have started the AI wars with Siri on its smartphones and tablets, but Amazon, again, stole a march with the Alexa AI hosted on its Echo speaker and hub. Google has followed suit with Google Home, and Microsoft has recently announced Project Evo, an initiative to build similar hubs. And it’s worth keeping in mind that the scope for enterprise applications of AI and IoT is considerably larger than that for the consumer market; the learnings from the latter will be applied to the former. There are no certainties in the tech industry, of course. There was a time when companies like IBM and Oracle led the rest. And while the control the reigning tech giants have established protects them from competitors, it also opens them up to unexpected challenges, such as from European regulators wary of monopolistic behaviour. But for now, it seems the primary battles will play out between them—and the contours of those battles will impact both the functioning of enterprises and how individuals interact with technology that not too long ago used to be static and desk-bound.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:50 AM, January 9, 2017 Updated: 7:10 AM, January 9, 2017 DETROIT - Google <GOOGL.O> unveiled its latest self-driving system in a Chrysler Pacifica minivan during a Sunday preview ahead of the Detroit auto show, saying the technology is more reliable and affordable. The announcement came from John Krafcik, head of Google's Waymo unit, whose search for partners to develop and install the company's autonomous driving technology into real cars has so far yielded only an alliance with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles <FCHA.MI><FCAU.N> and a pending deal with Honda Motor Co <7267.T>. Headlining a future mobility conference during the show's media preview, Krafcik said Waymo's latest set of self-driving hardware and software incorporated a new array of sensors, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar, all developed and built in-house. Krafcik said Waymo had reduced the cost of a single lidar unit by 90 percent, to about $7,500. Among major outside suppliers of this technology, Velodyne Lidar Inc and Quanergy Systems Inc both have said they are developing smaller solid-state lidar units that eventually would cost $200 or less. Waymo's existing test fleet of self-driving cars, including some specially equipped Lexus RX450s and Google's own "Firefly" prototypes, has accumulated nearly 2.5 million miles in less than eight years, mostly on city streets. Krafcik said Waymo planned to test the first self-driving Pacificas this month on public roads in California and Arizona. He did not say when the system would be ready to install in production vehicles. Delphi Automotive Plc <DLPH.N> and Mobileye NV <MBLY.N> have said they are collaborating on a self-driving system that could be sold to automakers beginning in 2019. Ford Motor Co <F.N>, General Motors Co <GM.N> and BMW AG <BMWG.DE> have said they intend to introduce self-driving cars in 2021.

Auto Tech by Chris Paukert January 8, 2017 1:30 PM PST @cpautoscribe Up Next New 2018 Buick Enclave expected at the New York Auto Show After seemingly stalling out in the public eye for a while, Google's self-driving car plans appear to be accelerating. Strongly. John Krafcik, CEO of the company's newly created Waymo division, has just shown off the company's autonomous Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan at the Detroit Auto Show. In fact, whether Google's autonomous efforts really ever paused in the first place remains an open question, because from the looks of the progress that Krafcik has outlined, things may have remained "all systems go" all along. Waymo's fleet of 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans hit the road this year.Photo by Waymo According to Krafcik, Waymo has taken the development of all self-driving-related sensors in-house to ensure seamless integration. The new network of sensors, including camera system, radar and Lidar are not just able to see things more accurately and from further afield, they're also cheaper than they were in the company's previous hardware packages. How much cheaper? For example, Krafcik notes that "Just a few years ago, a single top-of-the-range lidar cost upwards of $75,000. Today, we've brought down that cost by more than 90 percent. That's nine, zero. As we look to scale, we will do even better, with the goal of making this technology accessible to millions of people." That suggests the Lidar sensor costs around $7,500, which is still much too expensive for any traditional production car to absorb, but it's significant progress that will likely improve at scale. The company's new vision system incorporates no fewer than eight modules with multiple sensors, and a 360-degree forward-facing "super high resolution multi-sensor model," which Krafcik claims can now detect distant construction cones while the vehicle is running at full speed. Importantly, Waymo says it has made strides in radar development, too, and its new 360-degree system doesn't just track forward-moving vehicles, it can also register rear-approaching ones, too. Radar is seen as a particularly important tool in the fight to make self-driving cars work safely in inclement weather like fog, rain and snow, all of which can wreak havoc on sensors at any speed. 6 Waymo's self-driving Chrysler Pacifica shines up for Detroit Auto Show Speaking of speed, the number of autonomous test miles Google's prototypes have racked up is ramping up sharply. Krafcik notes that it took six years to achieve their first million autonomously driven miles, yet it only took 16 months to log the next million, and they are on track to reach three million miles this May, with that third milestone taking just 8 months. How much are Waymo's self-driving cars improving? The company claims a fourfold improvement in its disengagement figures over the last 12 months, a figure it's been working particularly hard to chip away at. Among its California-based test vehicles, Waymo says its cars are testing at "0.2 disengagements" per thousand miles driven, compared to 0.8 in 2015. Says Krafcik, "Now we believe we're at an inflection point where we can begin to realize the potential of this technology." Disengagements are particularly important success metric for Waymo, because the company is driving headlong toward full Level 4 autonomy, wherein passengers never need to take control of the vehicle. During his speech, Krafcik took a moment to subtly call out those pursuing part-time cars at Level 3 and below: "An 'almost' self-driving one -- what one might call 'aspirational autonomy -- it simply won't cut it," he said. The protuberances all over the Pacifica's bodywork hold Google-developed sensors.Photo by Waymo Of course, Google reps remain mum on what their ultimate goal for developing all this self-driving technology is anyhow. Whether the company plans to manufacture, sell or rent their own Waymo-branded vehicles, whether they intend to license their technology to legacy automakers or outside firms -- or any combination thereof -- remains an open question. In truth, Google's ambitions in this arena remain one of the biggest mysteries in the entire car industry. But the fact that Waymo has now acknowledged that it is going to the tremendous trouble and expense of developing its own full array of sensors should give pause to analysts and pundits who have been speculating that Google is increasingly only interested in being a software provider for autonomous vehicles. It may not yet be any clearer as to just what this Silicon Valley juggernaut has up its automotive sleeve, but it appears the world is at least a bit closer to finding out what Google -- and Waymo -- has in store.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Jan 8, 2017, 4:30pm EST Photos by Sean O'Kane share tweet Linkedin Waymo, the self-driving car startup spun-off from Google late last year, will be deploying its fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans onto public roads for the first time later this month, the company announced at the North American International Auto Show today. The minivans will be hitting the roads in Mountain View, California and Phoenix, Arizona, where the company’s self-driving Lexus SUVs have already driven thousands of miles over the past few years. Also today, Waymo gave the public its first look at the self-driving Pacificas, which have been under wraps since the deal between Google and Fiat Chrysler was first announced back in May 2016. "Mom, can you send the minivan to come pick me up from soccer practice today?" #NAIAS2017 pic.twitter.com/reUmaDZqzC— Andrew J. Hawkins (@andyjayhawk) January 8, 2017 But here’s the thing about these minivans. Waymo says that for the first time, its producing all the technology that enables its cars to completely drive themselves in-house. That means for the first time, the Google spin-off is building all its own cameras, sensors, and mapping technology, rather than purchasing parts off the shelf as it had done in the past. This allows the company to exert more control over its self-driving hardware, as well as bring the cost down to ridiculously cheap levels. In a speech in Detroit, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said that by building its own LIDAR sensors, for example, the company was shaving 90 percent off its costs. That means sensors that Google purchased for $75,000 back in 2009 now only cost $7,500 for Waymo to build itself. Waymo CEO John Krafcik To be sure, the cost of high-end LIDAR sensors have dropped precipitously over the years. Velodyne, a top supplier of LIDAR, retails its sensors for $7,999. But by building its own (or contracting out the manufacturing), Waymo is able to get LIDAR sensors to its exact specifications. For instance, Krafcik said the company developed two new types of LIDAR: short range and long range, allowing its vehicles to see people and objects very close to the car, as well as spot tiny objects far away. That said, Waymo has no interest in becoming an auto parts supplier like Delphi or 3M. Rather its focus is on forging partnerships with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) like Chrysler and Honda to purchase fleets of vehicles or retrofit for self-driving capabilities. Rumor has it that Waymo and Chrysler will eventually launch its own autonomous ride-sharing service to compete with the likes of Uber and Lyft, possibly by utilizing Google’s Waze mapping service. Indeed, during his remarks in Detroit, Krafcik said Waymo was eyeing a number of products, including ride-hailing, logistics, personal transportation, and last-mile solutions. When it spun off Waymo in early December, Google essentially conceded that it was dropping its plan to build its own car, instead refocusing its efforts on making the hardware and software needed to power self-driving. It may be too soon to say that Google is abandoning its plans to build a fleet of driverless cars without steering wheels and pedals. Previously, Krafcik made it clear that Waymo “is not a car company, there’s been some confusion on that point. We’re not in business of making better cars, we’re in the business of making better drivers.” In this Storystream Detroit Auto Show 2017: the biggest cars, concepts, and news The 2017 Detroit Auto Show in pictures Google’s new self-driving minivans will be hitting the road at the end of January 2017 View all 13 stories Next Up In Transportation Google takes another step towards launching its own self-driving Uber-killer with new patent The 2017 Detroit Auto Show in pictures This disassembled Aston Martin DB11 engine is engineering pornography Tesla’s latest Autopilot update rolls back its speed cap on undivided roads Why carmakers want to keep Apple and Google at arm's length Fiat Chrysler reportedly facing US criminal probe in emission scandal Now Trending Apple removes app that let you find your AirPods Rogue One's reshoots show how Disney saved the first standalone Star Wars movie This disassembled Aston Martin DB11 engine is engineering pornography The bizarro big business of Mark Wahlberg and national tragedy DirecTV Now appears to be a complete mess This Article has a component height of 70.

Waymo, which began life as Google’s self-driving car project, has built all of its own sensors for use on its latest test vehicles, self-driving Pacifica minivans. Use of in-house sensors is huge, since it means Waymo can likely lay claim to controlling more of the self-driving car technology stack than any other player in operation today. Much like Apple can do a lot more than most of tis competitors because it owns and builds both the software and the hardware for its product suite, Waymo can claim tighter integration between its sensor hardware, sensor fusion software, image recognition and other aspects of its self-driving system. Waymo also claims individual performance benefits in each of its new sensors, including vision cameras, radars and LiDAR, saying each provides better resolution, sensing distance and accuracy than the hardware it has been using on prior vehicles. Krafcik also says that its decision to build out all of its sensor suites in-house has a significant talent benefit, since it means that it’ll now have deeply knowledgeable experts in each key sensing area, who can work closely with resources on the AI engineering side to ensure the best possible use of the gathered data by the car’s in-vehicle computational systems. Plus, development cycles should get shorter between generations of software and hardware thanks to their ability to control both. Waymo also created two new categories of LiDAR in its effort to develop its own sensors. Previous vehicles used a single top-mounted medium-range LiDAR, but new short and long range sensing units included in this package mean that the surround view the car sees is now complete, and more granular detail detection both up close and at a distance. Maybe most important from the perspective of Waymo’s ability to woo automaker partners is that building its own sensors gives the company significant cost advantages down the road. After the initial cost of research and development, cost reduction on a per unit basis should grow significantly over time, leading to Waymo’s ability to get a lot closer to reaching prices car OEMs are more comfortable at scale, more quickly. Krafcik says the cost of a single top-end LiDAR, which was $75,000 when Google began experimenting with self-driving vehicles, has dropped by 90 percent thanks to its efforts to build its own. Waymo will field Pacificas with this homegrown sensor suite on board beginning in Arizona and California later on this month, Krafcik announced on Sunday. Throughout its time as Google’s self-driving car project and more recently as Waymo, the company has racked up almost 2.5 million miles driven, with most of those accumulated on city streets. It just take them just eight more months to pass the 3 million mile threshold. Volume is key for autonomous tech not only for training systems, but also for helping prove to regulators and industry stakeholders that th tech is actually safe. Speaking of safety, Waymo says it’s had a four-fold improvement in performance of its vehicles in the last year, as measured by the number of disengagements (when a safety driver has to stop the self-driving software and take over manual control). In 2015, the number of disengagements was around 0.8 times per thousand miles in California, and currently, Waymo’s only seeing around 0.2 disengagements per thousand miles travelled. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Waymo Founded 2009 Overview Waymo stands for a new way forward in mobility.

 Google just made a big move to bring down the cost of self-driving cars Danielle Muoio Jan. 8, 2017, 4:30 PM 9,190 facebook linkedin twitter email print Waymo's self-driving car, an autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivan.Waymo See Also Google is spinning out its self-driving car business into a new company called Waymo Here's the logo for Google's brand new self-driving car company, Waymo Google's self-driving car fleet may soon include Honda cars Google parent company Alphabet just made a big move to bring its self-driving car tech to market cheaper and faster. Alphabet-owned company Waymo has slashed the price of lidar, a key component of self-driving cars that helps them see the world, by 90%, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said during a keynote address to kick off the Detroit Auto Show on Sunday. Lidar is the most expensive component of self-driving cars. As Krafcik noted in his address, a single unit cost $75,000 just a few years ago. A lidar sensor is attached to the top of a car where it spins and shoots out lasers to create high-resolution maps of the car's surroundings. "Just a few years ago, a single top-of-the-range lidar cost upwards of $75,000. Today, we’ve brought down that cost by more than 90%," Krafcik said. "As we look to scale, we will do even better, with the goal of making this technology accessible to millions of people." Waymo is also building all of its self-driving car hardware in-house to ensure that it can scale, Krafcik said. If Waymo has indeed managed to reduce that top-range lidar cost by more than 90%, the company is looking at a price of roughly $7,500 per sensor. Waymo originally used lidar manufactured by Velodyne in its early prototype cars. Since its collaboration with Waymo, Velodyne has reduced the price of its lidar to range from $8,000 to $30,000, depending on how many lasers it shoots out. Ford and China-based internet company Baidu have both invested $150 million in Velodyne for their self-driving car efforts. Google began hiring mechanical engineers to develop "novel lidar systems" in December 2015, marking a departure with Velodyne. Building self-driving technology to scale Waymo Waymo is making serious moves to bring its self-driving cars to market. Waymo is an independent company operating under Alphabet, Google's parent company, as of December. The tech giant has also partnered with Fiat Chrysler, which has supplied 100 Pacifica minivans integrated with Waymo's self-driving tech for testing on public roads in Arizona and California later this month. Waymo has recently changed some of its self-driving car plans in what appears to be an effort to bring the tech to market faster. Waymo originally was pursuing fully driverless cars without a steering wheel, brake, or gas pedals. In December, Waymo said that driver controls will not be removed due to the regulatory environment. The decision came as Waymo faced setbacks pursuing a steering-wheel-less car and felt mounting pressure from Uber, which has launched public trials for its self-driving cars in recent months. Waymo has also said it is not in the business of physically building cars, and that it intends to instead supply self-driving tech to other companies. Bringing its hardware efforts in-house instead of outsourcing from Velodyne, as well as reducing the price of components, is in-line with that strategy. Waymo has said it can see its self-driving tech being used for ride-hailing, personal transportation, public transit systems, and even trucking.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Steven Overly January 8 Follow @stevenoverly Waymo's chief executive introduced the company's self-driving car technology at the AutoMobili-D conference, which was held before the opening of the 2017 North American International Auto Show. (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) DETROIT — Google’s autonomous driving spinoff, Waymo, has developed sensors that pair with its self-driving software, potentially opening the door for the company to sell a comprehensive system that automakers build into future car models. Google initially built its self-driving software on a prototype car outfitted with sensors, cameras and other hardware from outside suppliers. But to build a more affordable and sophisticated system capable of fully autonomous driving, the company decided it needed to create both halves of the technology, executives said. The announcement comes just weeks after Japanese automaker Honda said it would incorporate Waymo’s technology into some of its vehicles. The companies said that deal was centered on research rather than producing vehicles for market, Bloomberg News reported. Chrysler has already adapted its Hybrid Pacifica minivan to use Waymo’s self-driving hardware and software, and one of those vehicles was put on display for the news media Sunday. This month, a fleet of 100 will begin driving on public roads in California and Arizona. Waymo chief executive John Krafcik did not outline specific plans for selling the self-driving sensors in a keynote address Sunday at AutoMobili-D, an automobile technology conference that began the day before the North American International Auto Show is set to start here. “Today we can imagine our self-driving technology being applied in a variety of ways: personal transportation, ride hailing, logistics, last-mile solutions for public transport, just to name a few,” Krafcik said. Krafcik also reported Sunday that engineers had to take control of the car while driving in autonomous mode less often in 2016 than the previous year, an indicator that the technology has improved. In 2015, engineers intervened 0.8 times for every 1,000 miles. In 2016, that number fell to 0.2 times. It has been previously reported that Google was rolling back plans to build its own car, although the company initially developed a self-driving prototype, called Firefly, that had no pedals or steering wheel. The company has touted the potential for self-driving technology to reduce fatal car collisions and assist those incapable of driving on their own. “To solve these challenges, we’re thinking bigger than a single use case, bigger than a particular vehicle, bigger than a single business model,” Krafcik said. Google spun its self-driving car project into a stand-alone company called Waymo last month, a sign that parent company Alphabet is serious about bringing the technology to market. The company also revealed that it quietly completed the first-ever ride with no driver in the vehicle in October 2015, when a blind passenger took a trip around Austin. Google set out to create self-driving technology in 2009, and Krafcik said the sensors unveiled Sunday are the latest iteration of that research and development. The system Waymo has developed surveys the car’s surroundings in three ways. The car can “see” its 360-degree surroundings and navigate accordingly using LIDAR sensors that send out millions of laser points each second and eight “vision modules” that construct a high-resolution picture. A radar system tracks objects as they move around the car. “It’s a virtuous cycle,” Krafcik said. “Better hardware gives us better data to develop our software; and as our software become more sophisticated, we get better at optimizing the most important aspects of our hardware.” The company has tested its technology on nearly 2.5 million miles of road to date.

The announcement came from John Krafcik, head of Google's Waymo unit, whose search for partners to develop and install the company's autonomous driving technology into real cars has so far yielded only an alliance with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and a pending deal with Honda Motor Co . Headlining a future mobility conference during the show's media preview, Krafcik said Waymo's latest set of self-driving hardware and software incorporated a new array of sensors, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar, all developed and built in-house. Krafcik said Waymo had reduced the cost of a single lidar unit by 90 percent, to about $7,500. Among major outside suppliers of this technology, Velodyne Lidar Inc and Quanergy Systems Inc both have said they are developing smaller solid-state lidar units that eventually would cost $200 or less. Waymo's existing test fleet of self-driving cars, including some specially equipped Lexus RX450s and Google's own "Firefly" prototypes, has accumulated nearly 2.5 million miles in less than eight years, mostly on city streets. Krafcik said Waymo planned to test the first self-driving Pacificas this month on public roads in California and Arizona. He did not say when the system would be ready to install in production vehicles. Delphi Automotive Plc and Mobileye NV have said they are collaborating on a self-driving system that could be sold to automakers beginning in 2019. Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and BMW AG have said they intend to introduce self-driving cars in 2021.

Q is behind most of Bond's gadgets - from poison darts-filled wrist guns to pistols with palm print readers - that moviegoers have come to associate with the 007 movies. Similarly, Mr Lim, 46, has engineered one of the biggest tech inventions, Gmail, now synonymous with the company he has worked in for almost 15 years. The webmail service, in which the Singaporean owns 16 patents, has captured more than one billion active users around the world. He is now on a new mission: to allow people to speak to a computer like they are having a natural conversation with a real person. Together with a handful of engineers here and in Mountain View, California, his goal is to develop better algorithms for Google Assistant, a virtual personal assistant. YOU CAN HAVE A SAY Just like in Star Trek where people speak to machines, speech is a more natural way of communication than typing. MR LIM JING YEE This is to allow Google to learn and better understand users' intentions when they say things like "lunch nearby" or "my photos of London" to their Google Pixel phone or the new messaging app Allo. Google Assistant will eventually be embedded in the firm's other products. The larger goal is to reach the next billion Internet users who may not be tech-savvy or literate. There are an estimated 3.5 billion Internet users worldwide today. "Just like in Star Trek where people speak to machines, speech is a more natural way of communication than typing," said the soft-spoken software engineer, who has since 2008 been based in Singapore. "Voice-activated personal assistants are also a good tool to bridge the digital divide." Speaking to The Straits Times at Google's new office in Mapletree Business City II in Pasir Panjang, he noted that there are many possibilities in this emerging speech-to-text space. "Who knows, digital assistants may detect shock in one's voice or facial expression and automatically translate that to a text message with bigger font sizes." Mr Lim pioneered the concept of clustering e-mails of the same thread into a conversation - a breakthrough design that makes it easier for users to find their e-mails. Known as "conversation view" - a patent registered under his name in the United States - the feature was rolled out with the launch of Gmail in April 2004, when he was based in Mountain View. Then, Gmail also offered generous storage space of 1GB for free to users when its rival Hotmail was giving only 2MB without a fee. "The webmail offerings were not very exciting at that time," he said. But, today, Google Assistant is up against prominent rivals like Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa, and emerging ones like Chinese search giant Baidu's Little Fish. Even so, Mr Lim is not new to challenges having navigated the regional differences in addressing and road naming when he helped to roll out Google Maps in South-east Asia in 2008. In India and Japan, for instance, some roads do not have names and numbers in addresses may not be set up in a sequence. To help users get from point A to point B, Google Maps has to use landmarks for navigation. He returned to Singapore that year with his wife, who was expecting their third child, and two young children - after spending close to two decades in Silicon Valley. "When the opportunity arose to launch Google Maps for the region in Singapore, I quickly volunteered," he said, noting he needed "better childcare support" from his parents and parents-in-law here. He had worked in consumer electronics firm Thomson Electronics and search engine firm Excite in Silicon Valley before becoming a "Googler" in 2002. What sparked his interest in computer science was a $5,000 made-in-Japan NEC computer his father bought in 1982 when he was just 12. And this resulted in hours of poring over a programming manual that came with the computer, which later led to small victories in the form of a basic calculator software and a Pac-Man-like computer game he created. His older brother, who is now working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, was also bitten by the same bug. Asked if his three children - aged eight, 10 and 12 - display any inclination towards hard sciences, his reply was: "They all seem to like maths." But he believes in granting them the freedom to explore which he was given by his parents. He is heartened by the changing mindset towards engineering as a career, with giants like Google and Amazon hiring here. Still, his advice to young people is not to take up a job just because it pays well. "No matter what career path you take, you should follow your passion."

The news was tweeted this afternoon by John Krafcik, Waymo CEO. It comes one day after Fiat Chrysler said it had assembled 100 of the vans and delivered them to Waymo in Mountain View, Calif. Earlier this year, Google opened a development center in Novi where it conducted some of the work on the self-driving Pacifica. Waymo will begin testing them in January. FCA and Google announced their partnership last May. Last week, the tech giant announced the self-driving car project would henceforth be known as Waymo. ►Related: Fiat Chrysler delivers 100 Pacificas to Waymo for driverless fleet ►Related: Google to call self-driving car a Waymo FCA modified the Pacifica's electrical, powertrain, chassis and structural systems. Waymo will now outfit them with an additional computer and suite of sensors, cameras, LiDAR and radar that navigates the van. Google engineers have completed about 3 million miles of human-occupant public road testing with its smaller pod-like vehicles that are navigated without a steering wheel or pedals.

That concept was particularly embodied by Google’s “Koala” car — a simplistic pod without a steering wheel, brakes, or a gas pedal — that drove a blind passenger on public roads in Austin in 2015. Lyft co-founder John Zimmer boldly declared in September car ownership will “all but end” in cities in just 5 years with the advent of the autonomous car fleets Lyft is developing. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company will have a fully self-driving car road ready in 2018, and is currently installing hardware in its cars as part of that aim. Ford also plans to roll out a fleet of fully self-driving cars in 2021 that come without a steering wheel, brake or gas pedals. Baidu, a Chinese internet company, plans to use its self-driving cars for a public shuttle service in 2018 and to mass produce the cars in 2021. So the list is fairly lengthy when it comes to companies looking to produce completely autonomous cars, some without driver controls altogether, within the next 5 years. But at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, Toyota pushed back on the idea that we are just a few years off from an autonomous reality. “I need to make it perfectly clear, [full autonomy is] a wonderful, wonderful goal. But none of us in the automobile or IT industries are close to achieving true Level 5 autonomy. We are not even close,” Gill Pratt, the CEO of the Toyota Research Institute, said at CES. Level 5 is an industry term for cars that are fully autonomous and do not require human supervision. ToyotaToyota’s CES concept car keeps the driver front-and-center. Pratt’s comments aren’t particularly surprising when considering Toyota’s self-driving efforts. When the Toyota Research Institute was formed in 2015, Toyota said the aim was to roll out cars with semi-autonomous features in 2020. The TRI’s ultimate goal is to build a car incapable of causing a crash, but the Japanese automaker has always operated on a more conservative timeline. But Pratt’s comments are more surprising when considering the industry at large. Pratt isn’t just saying Toyota can’t achieve full autonomy in the next 5 years, but that no one can. Nissan also thinks full autonomy is still ways off. Maarten Sierhuis, Nissan’s head of research and development, told Wired that fully self-driving cars aren’t going to happen in the next 5 to 10 years. Google’s self-driving car company, Waymo, is still committed to Level 5 full autonomy where a car doesn’t require any human supervision whatsoever. However, the company recently ditched its efforts to have a self-driving car without driver controls because of the regulatory environment. TeslaTesla Autopilot. When it comes down to it, self-driving car companies are starting to pull back on grandiose visions for self-driving cars either because the tech isn’t ready or the regulatory environment won’t support it. There have already been real-world examples of these challenges. Tesla experienced its first known fatality while Autopilot was activated because the system couldn’t see a white trailer against a brightly lit sky. Tesla has since updated Autopilot, saying it could have potentially prevented the accident from occurring. The accident, which is still under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drew criticism from Consumer Reports, which called on Tesla to disable Autopilot. Autopilot isn’t a fully autonomous system, but it highlights a real tension in the industry: should automakers release autonomous systems before they’re fully ready? Should regular human drivers be expected to monitor them effectively? If the answer is no, then when can we say the tech is ready enough, and can we really expect that level of confidence in 5 years? Even if the tech is ready, it’s unlikely the government will support its entry in a mere 5 years. The federal government has released guidelines for self-driving cars, but has been tepid about making a concrete plan for their arrival. Business Insider/Corey ProtinBehind the wheel of a self-driving Uber. This isn’t to say self-driving tech is a bad thing — autonomous systems will cut down on the number of traffic fatalities. Around 33,000 people die in traffic-related accidents every year and it’s not a number we should be taking as lightly. Using tech to make cars safer is a good thing. But overpromising on the tech’s capabilities has very real consequences. When Autopilot was first released, there were countless videos of people misusing the system, like shaving instead of monitoring the car. It’s possible that the man who died when Tesla’s Autopilot system failed was watching “Harry Potter.” But automakers are catching on to these risks and reacting accordingly. Toyota is exploring AI that can keep a driver engaged while autonomy is still in its relative infancy. Nissan is exploring using call centres so humans can remotely intervene when self-driving cars fail. Google is keeping driver controls. Following the fatal Autopilot accident, Tesla installed a warning system that will sound if a driver’s hands aren’t on the wheel. If a driver ignores the warning, Autopilot will shut down. Tesla has also been more careful about how it markets Autopilot, such as removing a Chinese term for “self-driving” from its China website in August. The fact that automakers are being more realistic about the state of autonomous tech and considering the right way to introduce it to drivers to should be seen as a good thing. This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

The Web-versus-native debate has been raging for a few years. With Apple and Google seemingly coming down firmly on the side of their own platforms, there was a time when it seemed it might be game over for web-based solutions. Not so. The fact is, while native apps may have come to dominate the marketplace, Web apps still have their merits. As developers, the things that really matters to us are the target audience, what the app is going to offer them and how it's going to do it. It's about making the right choice of platform to deliver easy access and the best functionality. We're also seeing markets converge, enabling a hybrid approach to app development. Third-party W3C HTML5 frameworks such as Phonegap from Cordova can allow developers to use the best of both approaches. What’s more, cross-platform coding enables apps that have access to the full spectrum of functionality exposed by the underlying platform and device, including platform-specific capabilities like Apple Pay and Android Wear. As mobile has become the major player in brand engagement, so native apps have become the preferred option. It's not just the fact that they can be controlled and sold exclusively through online sites such as Apple's App Store and Google Play, creating potentially huge revenue streams for developers and service providers. Because they're developed specifically for each platform, they can easily access hardware in the device such as Bluetooth and generally run faster than Web apps, delivering a better user experience too. They also can take advantage of native gestures such as inertial scrolling and share data such as contacts and photos. What's more, they don't need to be downloaded every time they're launched. However, it's not all bad news for Web apps. W3C HTML5 has started widening its horizons, gradually delivering improved functionality. For example, Web apps can now gain access to a mobile device's built-in camera. If you're targeting a wide user base, rolling them out to multiple platforms can be easier, cheaper and, of course, quicker.  (The only installation required is a URL.) They're easy to find via a Web search. Plus, they automatically upgrade to the latest version every time you load a page. When you're designing an app, it's important not to make any judgement about the platform before fully understanding the project scope. What does the client want the app to achieve? For example, user-friendliness might be more important than speed. Or the app may have to deal with large amounts of data input. As with most technology, the future development of apps will be driven by customer behavior. Over the past few years, consumer data has shown that mobile browsers are being used less and less. However, we could still see increased synergy between native and web apps. At Google I/O 2016, Google launched an Android upgrade that enables the operating system to run native apps through the browser without downloading them. The next big thing is, of course, the Internet of Things (IoT), which could well be the catalyst that drives further industry convergence. To move forward and truly realize the potential of IoT, we need to adopt a standard set of protocols, something that has so far proved very difficult to achieve. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) wants to adopt common standards across IoT development. However, HTML doesn’t currently have the technology to run and connect with IoT devices. Change could be accelerated by the launch of new IoT home based products, such as HomeKit by Apple and Weave from Google. By providing new opportunities for brands to engage directly with consumers, they will naturally widen the market for app developers. Instead of wasting time perpetuating the Web-versus-native argument, which is holding back development, the industry could be making greater progress towards convergence and standardisation, particularly in the IoT arena. The picture is a little different in emerging markets, where apps have the potential to transform lives, providing unprecedented access to useful information and data. However, key challenges for users include connection availability and speed, as well as access to power sources. Google has already built a feature into Android that saves bandwidth by not fully loading Web pages. The company has also launched a line of Android devices targeted at developing countries, Android One, a key feature of which is advanced battery-saving technology. As for connectivity, once standardization is achieved, online-offline switching will come into its own. Updates and new information can be sourced automatically when a signal is available. As markets and technologies evolve, so will app development and its future will no doubt become clearer. In the meantime, as developers we must continue to keep an open mind, selecting our approach based on the needs of each individual project. -- Mark Thomas is CEO of Coderus, a software development company in the U.K. Email This Print Comment Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

Khalil Abdullah Leave a comment 786 reads (TriceEdneyWire.com) – Google has long been seen as a visionary company, one that has ushered in a host of innovations that have transformed the way people live and, in the process, turned the company itself into a celebrated and iconic brand. Its national expansion into broadband is a venture known as Google Fiber, but as the corporate giant seeks to enter the business of running high-speed Internet networks in cities around the country, Google’s visionary reputation masks potentially troubling practices that recall some of our nation’s darkest days around the issues of race and economic class. Instead of providing Internet, or broadband, service to all residents in the communities it plans to serve, Google appears to be engaged in the abhorrent practice of redlining: depriving these services to certain neighborhoods based on income, ethnicity and race. Should this pattern hold true, the inevitable result will be the undermining of communities that are in most need of broadband access, thereby deepening the digital divide. Already too many Americans are without online access at a time when such access is no longer a luxury but a necessity in every household for everything from paying bills, searching for jobs, pursuing advanced educational degrees and accessing health records. In Kansas City, as the deadline approached for neighborhoods to sign up for Google Fiber, higher-income, European-American neighborhoods were hooked-up first, while lower-income, primarily African-American neighborhoods were not. Compounding the problem was that prospective customers need a credit card to sign up for service, something that many residents in poor communities lacked. In Nashville, African-American religious leaders have questioned Google’s commitment to their neighborhoods. Google Fiber has installed service in mainly a few downtown buildings and residencies. Pastor Frank Stevenson of St. Luke’s Primitive Baptist Church has led a group of more than 20 clergy to raise awareness about potential digital redlining. “In this land of fast-moving access, to not have access puts us at a disadvantage,” Stevenson lamented. “We want to make sure that Google will be responsible in how they provide services in this city.” In Atlanta, Google Fiber is initially offering service in Old Fourth Ward, Virginia-Highland, and Morningside/Lenox Park. These are some of the more affluent and popular neighborhoods in the city. As for poorer neighborhoods, they will have to wait until Google gets to them – and who knows for sure when that will be. None of this should be altogether surprising for anyone who has followed Google, a bastion of wealthy European-American males, not unlike Silicon Valley itself. News reports have tracked the dismal record that Google and other high-tech companies in Silicon Valley have in employing African-Americans, Hispanics and women. Many apologists for Google have argued that Google’s hiring record is a result of the difficulties the company says it has had identifying minorities who have the specialized education needed to compete in the high-tech industry. Even if true, it is beyond plausibility to suggest that Google does not have the resources to cultivate American-grown talent — whatever the ethnicity or income status — by augmenting STEM programs and local, county, and state education systems. But Google’s troubling hiring practices have extended beyond its high-skilled workers and have been reflected in its hiring of non-tech employees as well. At a minimum, this suggests that Google’s leaders operate in an insular world of high-tech wizardry. They remain either largely blind to or willfully ignorant of the larger societal issues around them. The emerging conflicts between Google and the communities within cites targeted for Google Fiber is somewhat ironic — if not hypocritical — given that the Google has long positioned itself as the champion of a principle it likes to tout: “Democracy on the web works.” Indeed, for all the talk of ushering in a revolutionary era, Google Fiber’s rollout bears many of the trappings of the practices of banks, mortgage lenders, telephone companies, and other corporate actors that have redlined low-income and minority communities in the past. And let’s be candid: some still do. Devotion to higher profits at the expense of greater societal good should not be excused by the thin veneer of Google returning shareholders’ value. Redlining results in the wholesale disenfranchisement of communities and, ultimately, despite short-term profits, a weaker economic foundation for America’s future. Maybe the algorithm of how redlining undermines American communities is too sophisticated for Google to grasp, but it should halt this discriminatory practice nonetheless. Google could certainly refuse. But, as a colleague said, before we ask Washington to step in to fix this, why don’t we demand this of Google ourselves?

Advertisement Last year, Google released an Android 7.1 Developer Preview, a beta for Nexus devices. The beta showcased some of the update’s features and it let select Nexus users test the update’s performance ahead of the final release. The company promised an Android 7.1 release for Nexus devices in December and the company made good on that promise. More recently, the company’s released a brand new January Android 7.1.1 build that brings security patches and according to some users, problems, to the Nexus 5X. A January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat update is now available. It’s a small update but it comes with some important changes. Advertisement This roundup takes a look at the new Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat update, Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 problems plaguing users on both the old and new Android 7.1.1 builds, a look at what might be coming after the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update, and some tips that might help you. We’ll continue to update this with new information so check back for regular updates as we cruise through the month. January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Update   1 / 7 Earlier this month Google released a new January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 update. It delivers new security patches to the device. It also could have a positive/negative impact on your device's performance. Here's a quick look at the new Android 7.1.1 build's performance on our device.  We've spent a little over a week with the new Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 update and battery life appears to be holding up.  If you recently installed the Android 7.1.1 update, note that it sometimes takes battery life a couple of days to settle in. If problems persist, you'll need to take action.  Advertisement Up to this point we haven't run into any problems with connectivity. We've tested the Nexus 5X and its new Android 7.1.1 Nougat build with several ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. Our connections remain strong and fast. We haven't experienced any random reboots or lockups/freezes/crashes and we haven't seen any UI lag when navigating around the home screen, apps and folders. Animations and transitions are snappy and fluid and it feels like it did when we first opened it back in 2015.  So far, the January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat update is performing well on our device. We recommend it for most users, particularly those who value their security. If you're feeling leery, track down a second or third opinion before installing it on your device.    1 / 7 21 Responses 10/07/2016 dennphill Reply Had no issues with upgrading to Nougat on my Nexus 5X (Verizon) yesterday – 6 Oct. Anguish in first several pages not necessary in my experience. Phone and service and WiFi (etc.) all seem OK. 10/08/2016 DennisUSA Reply My fingerprint reader has suddenly stopped working. Don’t know if it is related, but this seems suspicious. Anyone have any ideas for me? 10/12/2016 Pratyaksha Reply My Nexus also got the same problem of fingerprint then I just factory data reset now it’s working fine 10/13/2016 HellOJones Reply Finger printer sometimes collide with other apps, try deleting recently installed apps and rebooting device. For me, mine started working as soon as I deleted certain apps. 10/13/2016 Elicon200 Reply I found that my battery was not lasting nearly as many hours as it used it. Noticed immediately; from average 13 hours to about 8. 01/15/2017 Abhishek Gour Reply Same issue on mine too. And it started pretty abruptly. Getting an air of around 2 hours now, which used to be 3- 3 1/2 hrs 10/15/2016 Mohammed Hussain Reply Hi friends this is Hussain Actually I’m using Nexus 5x 32gb last 2months, Mobile is fantastic performance but last time android nougat 7.0 upgrade in my device. Suddenly my play store apps download in WiFi network only not download in mobile data. Please rectify my issues. And battery also drain quickly compared to marshmallow… 10/18/2016 igybundy Reply Many of us got dead phones after the update, usually from 2015 models. So if it is out of warranty wait until google says something. It might have been a bad OTA during the release but some have posted from a couple of weeks ago when they decided to update. After the flash and reboot, the screen is blank and will not turn back on, for others it goes into a boot loop and can not be recovered except for a new motherboard. 11/16/2016 Brendon Reply This happened to mine. Phone bricked a fee weeks after upgrade never to come to life again. While on a call with Google I was transferred to LG who told me that they cover it under warranty for 18 months from date of manufacture. Mine is currently out for repair. 12/15/2016 Mac Reply This is happening A BUNCH!!!! Many 5x phones are turning into a paper weight… I was advised by my son, who is now using a back-up phone due to his 5x completely gone… AND is currently fighting with LG and Verizon because as soon as the update downloaded, it fried!!! 12/15/2016 Mac Reply Update to my last posting, LG and Verizon will reimburse for the loss of the phone (in my sons case) if the phone was purchased with a credit card. Apparently, if the phone was beyond its year of Warranty, the credit card purchase is a type of ‘Warranty’… But, this is what my son is telling me. He might have swallowed his pride on the loss, and simply upgraded a (14 month) old phone. I am finding it Pathetic that we are paying out $500 a year to be forced into a mandatory “upgrade” once a phone developer decides to render our working product USELESS. Maybe we should leave cars on the side of the road once the gas tank goes empty, and blame it on the dealerships!!!! 10/22/2016 Harshit Reply Have been experiencing lagging in my Nexus 5X after the update. The UI seems to get jammed. Also the camera loading takes a while 10/28/2016 Afshin Reply I have not received any OTA update for android 7 on my Nexus 5x! Is it normal? Another question! Does the android 7 causes Bootloop on Nexus 5x? 10/28/2016 Afshin Reply My Device runs Android 6.1! 11/14/2016 amir Reply @Afshin, I read about bootloop, but i just got my 5X today. I will open the box and post here about it. 11/16/2016 Sean Reply My battery life has been terrible with the first release of Nougat 7.0. I just updated to the latest update and the battery life boosted to double the amount. 75% showing 1 day and 5hrs of usage. 12/08/2016 Anonymous Reply So all the article here is doing is complaining about the 7.0 update but it doesn’t explain how to bypass it to update to 7.1? 12/15/2016 Steve Simms Reply Steve I just did the 7.1.1 upgrade on my Nexus 5x and it cycles through the start up look over and over. I have shut it down after trying the hard re-set numerous times. Does anyone have any ideas on a fix. Seeing I cant get the phone to open the home page before going through the start up mode again i’m not sure what to do next. HELP 01/06/2017 Scott Reply I still haven’t received the 7.1.1 OTA update for my 5X. I’m still on 7.0. Is this an issue with my phone or is Google still in the process of rolling it out? 01/08/2017 alanbecker.deviantart.com Reply Real instructive and wonderful anatomical structure of content , now that’s user friendly (: 01/11/2017 Matt Reply 7.1.1 has broken Bluetooth connectivity with many people with certain types of car head units. My Joying head unit repeatedly connects and disconnects now.

 Automakers are slowing their self-driving car plans — and that could be a good thing Danielle Muoio Jan. 8, 2017, 3:01 PM 5,522 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Google "Koala" self-driving car. AP Photo/Tony Avelar It was barely two years ago that self-driving car companies were putting forth a Utopian vision of driverless cars whizzing through streets allowing passengers to sleep in steering-wheel-less cars. That concept was particularly embodied by Google's "Koala" car — a simplistic pod without a steering wheel, brakes, or a gas pedal — that drove a blind passenger on public roads in Austin in 2015.  Lyft co-founder John Zimmer boldly declared in September car ownership will "all but end" in cities in just 5 years with the advent of the autonomous car fleets Lyft is developing. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company will have a fully self-driving car road ready in 2018, and is currently installing hardware in its cars as part of that aim.  Ford also plans to roll out a fleet of fully self-driving cars in 2021 that come without a steering wheel, brake or gas pedals. Baidu, a Chinese internet company, plans to use its self-driving cars for a public shuttle service in 2018 and to mass produce the cars in 2021. So the list is fairly lengthy when it comes to companies looking to produce completely autonomous cars, some without driver controls altogether, within the next 5 years. But at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, Toyota pushed back on the idea that we are just a few years off from an autonomous reality.  "I need to make it perfectly clear, [full autonomy is] a wonderful, wonderful goal. But none of us in the automobile or IT industries are close to achieving true Level 5 autonomy. We are not even close," Gill Pratt, the CEO of the Toyota Research Institute, said at CES. Level 5 is an industry term for cars that are fully autonomous and do not require human supervision. Toyota's CES concept car keeps the driver front-and-center. Toyota Pratt's comments aren't particularly surprising when considering Toyota's self-driving efforts. When the Toyota Research Institute was formed in 2015, Toyota said the aim was to roll out cars with semi-autonomous features in 2020. The TRI's ultimate goal is to build a car incapable of causing a crash, but the Japanese automaker has always operated on a more conservative timeline. But Pratt's comments are more surprising when considering the industry at large. Pratt isn't just saying Toyota can't achieve full autonomy in the next 5 years, but that no one can.  Nissan also thinks full autonomy is still ways off. Maarten Sierhuis, Nissan's head of research and development, told Wired that fully self-driving cars aren't going to happen in the next 5 to 10 years.  Google's self-driving car company, Waymo, is still committed to Level 5 full autonomy where a car doesn't require any human supervision whatsoever. However, the company recently ditched its efforts to have a self-driving car without driver controls because of the regulatory environment. Tesla Autopilot. Tesla When it comes down to it, self-driving car companies are starting to pull back on grandiose visions for self-driving cars either because the tech isn't ready or the regulatory environment won't support it. There have already been real-world examples of these challenges. Tesla experienced its first known fatality while Autopilot was activated because the system couldn't see a white trailer against a brightly lit sky. Tesla has since updated Autopilot, saying it could have potentially prevented the accident from occurring.  The accident, which is still under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drew criticism from Consumer Reports, which called on Tesla to disable Autopilot. Autopilot isn't a fully autonomous system, but it highlights a real tension in the industry: should automakers release autonomous systems before they're fully ready? Should regular human drivers be expected to monitor them effectively? If the answer is no, then when can we say the tech is ready enough, and can we really expect that level of confidence in 5 years? Even if the tech is ready, it's unlikely the government will support its entry in a mere 5 years. The federal government has released guidelines for self-driving cars, but has been tepid about making a concrete plan for their arrival.  Behind the wheel of a self-driving Uber. Business Insider/Corey Protin This isn't to say self-driving tech is a bad thing — autonomous systems will cut down on the number of traffic fatalities. Around 33,000 people die in traffic-related accidents every year and it's not a number we should be taking as lightly. Using tech to make cars safer is a good thing. But overpromising on the tech's capabilities has very real consequences. When Autopilot was first released, there were countless videos of people misusing the system, like shaving instead of monitoring the car. It's possible that the man who died when Tesla's Autopilot system failed was watching "Harry Potter." But automakers are catching on to these risks and reacting accordingly. Toyota is exploring AI that can keep a driver engaged while autonomy is still in its relative infancy. Nissan is exploring using call centers so humans can remotely intervene when self-driving cars fail. Google is keeping driver controls. Following the fatal Autopilot accident, Tesla installed a warning system that will sound if a driver's hands aren't on the wheel. If a driver ignores the warning, Autopilot will shut down. Tesla has also been more careful about how it markets Autopilot, such as removing a Chinese term for "self-driving" from its China website in August. The fact that automakers are being more realistic about the state of autonomous tech and considering the right way to introduce it to drivers to should be seen as a good thing.  This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

With a little tweaking, though, you can run any Android app on them. You can even get the entire Google Play Store on some devices. What You'll Need Amazon's Fire tablets are based on a de-Googled version of Android, but under the hood they're still pretty similar. This makes it pretty easy to install Android apps on your tablet, but some ways are easier than others. We're going to cover two ways to do this. Method #1 involves downloading Android APK installer files and installing them directly. Method #2 will install the entire Google Play Store, which you can use like you would on a normal Android phone. This method is a bit more complicated, but it will make it much easier to install any app you want. Plus it will give you the Google Play Services that you'll need for most Google apps. Here's what you'll need for both methods: A Kindle Fire Tablet: For method #1, you can use any Kindle tablet. We tested this method on an old 2nd generation 7" Kindle and it worked. For method #2, you'll need a 4th generation Kindle Fire or higher that's been updated to Fire OS 5. Android APKs (Method #1): If you want to install apps manually, you'll need to get the APK from somewhere. APKs are files that Android uses to install apps, similar to .exe files in Windows. We'll cover a few ways to get APKs, but if you have an Android phone that already has the app you want on your Fire tablet, it may come in handy. A Windows PC (Method #2): To install the Play Store on your device, you'll need to connect it to a Windows PC with a USB-to-micro-USB cable. ADB (Method #2): ADB is a powerful tool in the Android developer kit that lets you run commands on an Android device from your computer. You can download a small version of the tool from XDA here and install it in just a couple clicks. We have a full step-by-step guide here you should follow first. Once you have ADB, come back. RootJunky's SuperTool (Method #2): This tool will install the drivers you need on your computer to connect ADB to your tablet, then it will install the Google Play Store. If your Fire tablet is running Fire OS 5.3.1 or later, download the .zip file named Amazon-Fire-5th-Gen-Install-Play-Store.zip from here. If you're on an older version, grab Amazon-Fire-5th-Gen-SuperTool-old.zip from here. If you're not sure which version you're on, open the Settings app on the main screen of your Kindle, scroll to Device Options, and tap "System Updates." Your version number should be at the top. The process may be slightly different, depending on your device. Let's get started. Method #1: Download and Install Android Apps Manually Since Kindle Fire tablets run a version of Android, you can manually install Android apps. First, you'll need to tweak a setting so you can install apps from outside Amazon's app store. To get started, follow these steps: Scroll through the apps section of your Kindle and open Settings. Tap Security. Enable the toggle that says "Apps from Unknown Sources." After that, you can install any app's APK you want, like the official Gmail app, Google Maps, or even Pokémon Go (assuming you have a model with GPS). First, you'll need to find some. Free apps are easy to find around the web, but paid apps come with copy protection, so the easiest option there is to buy the app and install it on another Android device first.. Here are a few ways to get the ones you're looking for: Find popular apps on APK Mirror. This site hosts hundreds of apps from Google, Facebook, Samsung, and many others. Each APK is scanned to verify they're safe. Best of all, older versions of the app are archived, so you can find the version that works for your device. This is particularly handy for Kindle owners since the latest version of Fire OS is based on the older Android Lollipop. Use APK Downloader to pull apps from the Google Play Store. We've covered APK Downloader before, and it's one of the easiest ways to get APKs. Simply go to an app's Play Store listing on the web and grab the app's package name from the address bar (the part that looks like "com.xxxx.xxxx") and click "Generate Download Link." Download the APK, transfer it to your Kindle, and you can install it. Extract APKs from your own Android device. Since paid apps are protected, most APK extracting tools won't touch them. However, you can do it yourself. Use an app like Astro File Manager to create a backup of an app you already installed on your phone. Slide out the left-hand navigation panel Astro and tap the tools icon, tap App Mgr, and choose the app you want to move to your Kindle. Next, tap Backup. This will create a copy of the APK file on your phone in a folder labelled "backups." Copy the backed up file to your Kindle and open it to install it. Once you've downloaded an APK file, you should see a notification in your shade that says your download is complete. Tap it to install the file. If you missed the notification, open the Silk Browser app, tap the menu button and tap Downloads. You should be able to find your APK file there. This method will work sometimes, but keep in mind that a lot of apps require the Google Play Services framework for critical features like location services, account login, and payment tools. Some, especially Google's apps, won't even install or launch without this framework installed and running first. If an app you need is broken or won't launch, try installing the Play Store with method #2. Method #2: Install the Google Play Store Installing the full Google Play Store is the best way to get Android apps on your Kindle tablet over the long term. You don't have to download them one at a time, and anytime you need to install one, you can just open the store and grab it. You'll also get Google Play Services, which means more apps will work with it. However, this method is also more complicated, and you'll need to be comfortable with the command line. You should also try to do this as early as possible if you have a new Fire tablet. Amazon automatically applies system updates when you're not using your tablet, and this method may not work with newer versions of Fire OS. Fortunately, RootJunky's tool can block future updates, but it's best to get started with a fresh device running 5.3.1 or earlier if possible. Mine worked on version 5.3.2.1, but future updates may break this tool. If you already have a tablet or if it's already updated, give it a shot, but you might encounter some bugs. To get started, you'll need to enable developer options. Here's how: From the Home screen, scroll down and tap the Settings app. Tap Device Options. Tap Serial Number seven times. A pop-up notification should say "You are now a developer!" A new menu option named Developer Options should appear beneath Serial Number. Tap it. Tap the toggle that reads "Enable ADB." For the next part, you'll need to have ADB installed on a Windows PC. Find the RootJunky SuperTool you downloaded earlier (if you're running 5.3.1 or later get it here, for older versions get it here) , then follow these steps: Connect your Fire tablet to your PC with a micro USB cable. Extract the contents of the SuperTool .zip file to their own folder. Launch the batch file named 1-Install-Play-Store in the SuperTool folder. When the program finishes loading, you'll see a menu like the one above. Type 1 for "ADB driver install" and press Enter. Here, you can confirm whether ADB is working. Type 2 for "ADB driver test" and press Enter to test your ADB connection. If the app says the test failed, type 1 for "ADB driver install" to install the necessary drivers on your PC to connect ADB with your Fire tablet. Once you're finished, you will be returned to the main menu. Type 2 for "Install Google Play store and remove ads from lock screen." After the installation is finished, you should be back at the main menu. (Optional) Type 3 for "block OTA updates from Amazon." This will prevent an automatic update from breaking your apps. Once you're finished, restart your device immediately. You should now see the Play Store listed in your apps section. The first time you install an app that uses Google Play Services, you'll get a notification to download that as well. Once that's finished, you can download any app from the store just like it's a normal Android device. However, you may notice a few bugs. In my testing, I found that Gmail and Google Maps worked fine, but Inbox crashed as soon as I opened it. Also, even though I was logged into my Google account, the Play Store didn't recognise some paid apps I already bought. Your experience may differ depending on which device you use and which version of Fire OS you're running. The Kindle Fire tablets are powerful little devices that are dirt cheap. Even if you bought yours just to read books, the Play Store will unlock a lot of potential you never knew was there. Enjoy your new, more powerful tablet.

Gothard, in his fourth year of leading the Burnsville-Eagan-Savage School District, said the effort helps make students more "future-ready." Burnsville High students this year received 2,700 Google Chromebooks supplied through a partnership with Best Buy Education, Gothard said. Students in the school's information technology pathway learned how to process the computers and distribute them to classmates. They also received training in tech support and customer service to help classmates solve problems with their computers at a Geek Squad desk, also staffed by a Geek Squad manager, within the school. "The way that we're approaching traditional education in our classrooms is not very much aligned with what we've observed in the workplace," Gothard said. "We're trying to be that bridge through our pathways program," which covers a variety of career fields. Google representatives on hand for the computer rollout returned last month for an ExploreEDU event, where students demonstrated tech tools and apps and showed off Burnsville High's new Google workspace-inspired active, flexible learning environments. Gothard, who previously worked in the Madison, Wis., school district, has a master's degree in educational administration and a doctoral degree in K-12 educational leadership from Edgewood College. Q: What did students gain from the ExploreEDU event? A: They were wonderful hosts of some of our national and local partners. The students hit the ground running, showing how the tools of technology and the new spaces have created a whole new active engagement environment for us. Q: What influenced your view of students as clients? A: If we're just focusing on our high school, each one is at a very important time in their development in terms of what their future's going to be. It's incumbent upon us as educators to make sure that we're serving them as individuals and providing them with meaningful skill development that's going to propel them into a future-ready life. The way we address that at our high school is through space, skills, relationships and support. Q: What's the role of business and community partnerships? A: We rely on our partnerships to build ways that our businesses and community can have regular contact with our students. That could be through an internship, job shadowing, mentoring or being an expert panelist in a classroom. This is one way that we can build a coalition, build excitement and rely on thought experts throughout our community to help us do a great job.

By James Titcomb 8:58 AM Monday Jan 9, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Apple Inc Mobile Phones Technology Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs holds up the first iPhone that was introduced on January 9, 2007 in San Francisco, California. Photo / Getty Ten years ago, Steve Jobs held up a pocket-sized slab of glass and metal to an audience of thousands and declared: "Apple is reinventing the phone". The iPhone, unveiled a decade ago tomorrow, didn't look like much, and by today's standards its abilities look decidedly basic. The Daily Telegraph described it as a "one-button device that combines iPod, internet and a phone... can screen television shows and films, take photographs with a 2 megapixel camera, browse the internet, send emails and text messages". At the time, however, the iPhone was a revelation. Touchscreens, internet browsers and music players had all been included on mobile phones before, but never with the grace and ease-of-use that Apple's device allowed. By the time it was released in the UK later in November of that year via an exclusive deal with O2, Apple had sold a million of them. The Telegraph's reviewer, dubbing it the "Jesus phone", said it was "at once breathtakingly simple and gloriously clever", even if, as she noted, it lacked a 3G connection. The iPhone kicked off the smartphone revolution: the biggest boom in technology since the dotcom days at the turn of the century. But just as the frenzy around internet companies collapsed in on itself in 2000, experts fear that the smartphone's golden era is ending, even if a repeat of the previous crash is unthinkable. The new era came quicker than anyone had expected. One iPhone begat another, and another. Apple added sharper and bigger screens, better cameras, new designs and improved software. Even amid the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, the iPhone proved to be recession-proof. In 2009 Apple overtook Nokia as the world's most profitable mobile phone maker and then again in 2011 as the world's biggest smartphone seller by volumes. The iPhone had blown away the competition - Apple claimed its software was five years ahead of anything else available - but the competition did not stand still. Soon a slew of other devices running Google's free Android software, made by the likes of Samsung, HTC and Motorola, were on the market. Continued below.

In 2010 worldwide sales of smartphones grew by 76 per cent, a boom that would continue for several years. Whole industries - social media, music streaming and mobile gaming - as well as multibillion dollar companies such as Uber and Snapchat have been built on a product that barely existed a decade ago, while those that have failed to adapt have diminished. Smartphone sales had surged to 1 billion a year by 2013, and 1.3 billion the year after, but in 2015, growth in worldwide shipments fell from 28 per cent to 10.4 per cent, according to researchers at IDC. They estimate that shipments last year were 1.45 billion - barely more than in the previous year - and that growth will be slow again in 2017. Some manufacturers have seen dramatic rises and falls. HTC, which made the first Android phone in 2008, is now making heavy losses. Amazon released a phone to great fanfare in 2014, but discontinued it a year later. Google paid US$12.5 billion ($18b) for Motorola in 2012; two years later it sold out for less than US$3b ($4.3b). There were other casualties. Nokia's failure to keep up with Apple and Android cost it dearly: In 2011 its then chief executive Stephen Elop told staff they were "standing on a burning platform" and radically needed to change; two years later Nokia sold its mobile phone division to Microsoft, which was itself paranoid about missing out on the mobile revolution (Microsoft has now all but closed the division, its smartphone ambitions cut back drastically). BlackBerry once appeared all-conquering but the iPhone sent it into a slow and painful decline. The smartphone era's crowning moment came in 2011 when Apple's market capitalisation overtook ExxonMobil, making it the world's biggest company. But even the biggest players have not been without their challenges. Sales of the iPhone, the device that changed the market, have fallen in each of Apple's last three quarters, and the company reported its first fall in annual profits in a decade and a half last year. Samsung, which surpassed its American rival as the world's biggest smartphone seller in late 2011 and has stayed there since, has fared little better. Its most recent flagship phone, the Galaxy Note 7, plunged the company into crisis when faulty handsets were found to explode, forcing Samsung to recall the phone twice and wiping billions off its value. Three years ago, Samsung and Apple accounted for half the market between them; it is now less than a third. The major reason for slowing growth in smartphone sales, says Ranjit Atwal, a research director at Gartner, is that the market grew quicker than anybody had expected. "The transition [from basic phones] into smartphones has been pretty dynamic over the last three or four years, both in the mature markets and China and other emerging markets," he says. "People buying smartphones for the first time are trailing off, there is now saturation in terms of people that can afford to buy phones." However, there is also a feeling that established smartphone owners are becoming less inclined to upgrade as the innovation of previous years tails off. The second iPhone made leaps such as 3G connections, GPS and the App Store, and later models made radical design changes, introduced high-definition screens and allowed video calls. A customer sets up his new iPhone 7 Plus, right, as he switches from an iPhone 6 at an Apple Store. Photo / Bloomberg More recent changes have been less obvious, and the iPhone's design has stayed the same for three successive years. Progress has instead been at the bottom end of the market, in terms of the spread of astoundingly cheap but high-quality phones. Devices with the power of last year's high-end phones, made by manufacturers in India and China willing to accept cut-throat margins, are available at a fraction of the price of the high-end Apple and Samsung devices, meaning consumers have less reason to upgrade as they might with a car. "Historically the expectation was that individuals would upgrade, but in the basic segment those phones have become much better," says Atwal. As a result, consumers are upgrading less often, and in some Western markets, sales have declined. It is hardly a crisis - Apple sold its billionth iPhone last year - but not what investors might have hoped for. The threat is now that as consumers upgrade less often, the smartphone's trajectory comes to mirror that of the PC, where slower replacement cycles and diminishing improvements in technology, have seen sales fall for five consecutive years. To avoid such a fate, manufacturers must simply remain desirable by making their next phones significantly better than what came before - a feat more easily said than done. The improvements consumers demand most, such as improved batteries, have proved difficult to crack. Failing that, many companies have thrown themselves into new markets. HTC's virtual reality headset has won significant acclaim and Samsung has positioned itself at the heart of the "internet of things" - connected household objects such as fridges and dishwashers. Apple, meanwhile, has extended into wearable technology with its smartwatch, and is relying on booming software sales for growth - last week it said revenues from the iPhone App Store were up 40 per cent. But none of these areas are likely to the smartphone's success. The fact may be that the revolution Jobs began a decade ago is impossible to replicate. - Daily Telegraph UK By James Titcomb Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

From the endless booths of automotive-related products to massive car company displays, the entire and extremely massive show had a very heavy auto skew. The reason for that is simple: As the revolution of electric cars, connected cars and autonomous cars finally begins to take shape, tech companies are invading the automotive sector. Soon, your car will stop being little more than a dumb motor attached to some wheels. The tech giants charging full-steam ahead into the very lucrative automotive sector are the likes of Apple, Google, Uber and even Nvidia – once little more than a specialist in video graphics. These are the new rivals that should be keeping automotive executives up at night. They have cash, lots and lots of cash, and need to spend it on something. Apple was even reported at one point to be looking at a takeover of McLaren – and, to put things in perspective, the Cupertino-based company has a market capitalisation of USD $630 billion ($860 billion). Likewise, Google is worth USD $566 billion ($776 billion). Compare that with General Motors and Ford, which are at around USD $50 billion ($68 billion) each, and the Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi alliance that come in at around USD $70 billion ($95 billion) combined – and things begin to look a little bleak for traditional car makers as they face the biggest change and challenge in their history. Realistically, Apple and Google could buy a controlling stake in Ford, GM, Mitsubishi and Mazda and even Volkswagen ($100 billion), combined, with their existing free cash (held comfortably in Ireland). The point is the car makers are facing competition from companies that work on much higher margins and can afford to spend billions on R&D without any return. But while Apple and Google know how to make a pretty good phone, they arguably have no idea how to make a car. And while Mercedes makes amazing cars, its digital integration and connected-car services fail to come even close to the functionality of a modern smartphone. The game has turned into how fast car companies can learn to make autonomous technology with artificial intelligence that works versus how quickly tech companies can learn to make cars and deploy their far more mature digital technologies and artificial intelligence systems. Google’s deep learning system is something that many do not know about nor understand, but it represents the future of artificial intelligence. At a recent talk by a very senior Google executive in Sydney, the term ‘autonomous vehicle’ was used so many times that it became annoying. Google has changed its entire focus to artificial intelligence and the world will change because of it. Don’t think for one second that Google and Apple are content making a better search engine or nicer phones and computers – they are looking to grow, and that’s partly inspired by some crazy guy called Elon Musk. Speaking of which, if you believe the share market, Musk’s Tesla is worth more than Mazda,  Mitsubishi and Suzuki combined and just 25 per cent less than Ford or General motors. Think about that for a minute. Tesla makes fewer than 100,000 cars a year and those three manufacturers make more than 4 million – and, yet, the trio is worth about half Tesla’s value. Forgetting valuations for a minute, the arrival of the tech giants and Tesla should be scaring the hell out of car companies. Sure, the argument in their favour goes: “We’ve been doing this for more than a 100 years and cars are very complicated and regulated – making a car is far more complicated than making a gold iPhone.” That argument is one I’ve made myself before and it has some validity. Except for one thing: cars and mobility as we know it is rapidly changing. No doubt all the already mentioned car companies know how to make a great internal combustion engine, but why did it take Tesla to bring everyday electric cars to the forefront? Why was Tesla the first car company with autonomous driving technology that was more than just a concept? Some random upstart that has been ‘mass producing’ cars only since 2008. Two thousand and freaking eight! I remember 2008, it was like a few weeks ago. Tesla achieved both of these feats before any of the established manufacturers and, while it definitely has some ways to go to match the build quality of the old guard, it’s not exactly decades behind. A very senior German BMW executive recently told me that Tesla’s first-to-market success is due to the company not testing its products nearly as much as they do. Sure, that might be true (if something of an overstatement), but it also highlighted the weakness of car companies. They run like giant political corporations, overwhelmed by bureaucracy – while Tesla, Apple and Google operate like tech companies, where things happen at a much faster rate and with far leaner processes. All of these companies, be it vehicle manufacturers or technology giants, are all presenting solutions to problems of future mobility from different perspectives. Google and Apple are stealing car company staff like it’s going out of fashion in the hope of dazzling the market with their own product. Whether that’s an actual car or the software for the car seems to change every week. Meanwhile Uber and Ford envision a future where car sharing becomes a far bigger norm and Nvidia, best known for making pretty graphics a possibility, is now making a great deal of the hardware that drives the Tesla Autopilot system and is seeking to position itself as the Bosch of the new automotive era by producing commoditised artificial intelligence and vision processing systems. Shares in the company have gone up by more than 400 per cent in the last 12 months. The atmosphere around the autonomous driving systems is electric. Every auto maker wants to have the best system and yet, they were all beaten by some American upstart. Nissan and Volkswagen made big deals about their autonomous vehicle technologies at this year’s CES. Nissan with its man-in-the-middle approach (SAM) has basically admitted that autonomous cars won’t work on their own. They need a human monitoring them, Nissan says, so that when things get complicated, someone can dial in and help the car’s artificial intelligence out. Well, is that even an autonomous car anymore? More to the point, during the live demo of its new Nissan SAM, the system froze. Twice. The autonomous car was stuck and no one was coming to help. Nissan blamed it on a failed satellite link, which highlighted the lack of a backup solution. Really? It has such an obvious single point of failure and no one thought a backup would be a good idea? Volkswagen had a similar failure demonstrating its own autonomous vehicle technology. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Autopilot 2 system is in the hands of 1000 customers, being tested in the real world right now. To be fair, Mercedes ($110 billion) appears to be the only brand that is keeping in reach of Tesla, with its own autonomous car technology set to launch this year and the first stages of the technology already available in the S, E and C-Class. It’s worth noting that Mercedes bought a 9.1 per cent stake in Tesla in May 2009, before it went public, for an estimated $50m. It disposed of its shares in October 2014, making a cool $780m – and both companies learnt a fair bit along the way. The biggest advantage that tech companies have over the vehicle manufacturers, however, isn’t just a more innate understanding of artificial intelligence and connected devices. It’s mapping. Google and Apple maps are the two leading mapping systems in the world (Apple map jokes aside, the system has improved substantially over the years). Do you think Google’s Street View and Google Earth features were developed as a user-focused visual treat or side hobby for the company’s CEO? No. In order for autonomous cars to work properly, accurate mapping data is vital. It’s why BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi jointly purchased Nokia’s Here map system last year. The race is on to build the world’s most accurate mapping data. Perhaps it’s also worthwhile to remember that even though the traditional car makers are stuck in the current dealership model, new comers will further change the game and remove one of the least consumer friendly sides of the automotive business. Just look at an Apple Store experience compared to your local car dealer. So, here we are. Two industries are about to clash. The car as we know it is about to change more than anyone can predict. Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of Renault-Nissan and now Mitsubishi alliance said that the emergence of electric cars, autonomous cars and connected cars will see more change in the automotive industry in the next decade than we’ve seen in the last 50 years. He likened it to the revolution from horse-and-carriage to the car. How many horse-drawn carriage manufacturers can you name?

Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech — from IBM to Hewlett-Packard to Cisco to Yahoo — were eventually outmaneuvered by startups that came out of nowhere. The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place. Then, in the last half decade, something strange happened: The sharks began to get bigger and smarter. Nearly a year ago, I argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business, one that is typified less by the storied startup in a garage than by a posse I like to call the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable. In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The world’s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will. The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald Trump’s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds. This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year. Let’s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends — mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs. Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech — on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance. The Five aren’t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple’s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet’s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren’t entirely safe from competition from startups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot. Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from startups; today’s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five. What has changed is public perception. For years, most of the Five enjoyed broad cultural good will. They were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight, as the best that American capitalism had to offer. The exceptions were Microsoft, which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s, and Amazon, which got under people’s skin for, among other things, making books cheaper and more widely accessible, thereby hurting bookstores. But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you’re supposed to in America — by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren’t considered that bad. They weren’t causing environmental disasters. They weren’t selling cigarettes. They weren’t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five’s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn’t I called them the Fabulous Five? Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with. Silicon Valley grew cloistered, missing people’s unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives. When Apple took on the FBI last year over access to a terrorist’s iPhone, many in tech sided with the company, but a majority of Americans thought Apple should give in. During the long presidential campaign, Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Bezos’ main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Trump, but the industry’s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public. For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised — entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others. “During the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the US has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,” said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the US regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them. During Genachowski’s term at the FCC, and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring “network neutrality,” which declared that telecommunications companies could not favour some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favoured by tech companies. But as Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. “The next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things — battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,” he said. That’s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger — their benefits to society as well as their potential costs — when deciding how to police them. But there’s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today’s startups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five. That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Priyanka Chopra resting after accident on 'Quantico'...

The Android TV based player has been fully redesigned both in hardware and menus. The unit was shrunk is almost half the size of the previous model. Both the remote and game controller had to be redesigned to accommodate the additional features on the new model. The improvements are more than streaming 4K HDR video. NVIDIA has worked with Amazon Video to be the first to stream UHD HDR from the service. YouTube 360 can be experienced on your TV by using the joysticks on the controller to “look around” the video. Google Assistant has been added to the Shield. It’s not just that the Shield becomes a full-featured Google Home voice activated controller, but that NVIDIA worked with Google to add new abilities. Like a Google Home, after saying the “Okay Google” wakeup command, users can control their connected home, as well find movies, tv shows and music and more on the Shield. Because the Shield is connected to a TV, answers to some questions may be accompanied by a visual display. What’s revolutionary is the song search and photo features. For those times when you don’t know the name of a song, you can search for it by some of the lyrics or the chorus. The beefed up Google AI (artificial intelligence) can search through millions of songs and find the right one within seconds. It was impressive. The other Google Assistant feature lets you see your Google Photos on your TV. Simple ask to view a specific folder or album. As Google Photos has face and object recognition, you can ask to view only the photos you want (e.g., photos of a specific person, or all photos of dogs, beach photos, and so forth). NVIDIA created a sort of Amazon Dot for accessing the Google Assistant when you are too far from your Shield, a small ball-shaped “Spot” (sold separately) can be plugged directly into an outlet to take voice commands. The Shield can respond to commands when the TV is powered off. NVIDIA’s core fans are gamers who use the company’s high performance video cards for computers to play games with rich detail. PC game titles have become increasingly available on the Shield. The new Shield will have an improved gaming experience in conjunction with their GEForce subscription gaming offering. The NVIDIA Shield is taking pre-orders and will be shipping in January. The new model comes with both a controller and remote control (now with IR to control your TV). The remote controller was separate in the previous model. The bundle is $200 for the model with 16 GB of storage and $300 for the model with 500 GB of strorage. While it appears more expensive than the previous model, the new generation comes with a remote. Note that the Google Assistant will not be available for a few more months as an update. Look for my review in the coming weeks.

From slightly embarrassing medical issues, naff guilty-pleasure pop songs, to researching issues which are personal to you, the search engine never judges you. We're not here to judge, either. What you look up on Google is your business. Sort of. There is in fact a way of finding out what the person just before you searched. Here's how it works. The tool is called Mystery Search and while there's no way of knowing who that person is, it does throw up their results. So when you type something in, the person after you will be able to see what that was. For example, we were daydreaming about dinner, so decided to look up some inspiration. And got, er, whatever this is. A search for flowers which bloom in winter got us a result for how old Tom Hardy is (39 in case you were wondering), but the possibilities are endless and capable of being VERY weird - worryingly so sometimes. Because now people are cottoning on to this tool, they're having some fun with it. Taking to Reddit to share what the Mystery Search churned up for them, users revealed the results they got. There were alarming ones. "I got 'how to join KKK,'" someone disturbingly revealed. There were nonsense ones. 'I spent ages pondering before going for 'origin of shiver me timbers'. I got 'lol lol lol'" Read More Man's creepy wireless network prank on neighbour bags him free printer Go on and give it a whirl And there was penis banter aplenty. "I spent a lot of time coming up with Peter Piper's Pickled Penis.'" revealed another user, "because I wanted to have the shock value, but I wanted it to be semi-clever and I got back 'sunflower garden.' Better luck next time. Other results were 'sexy Pikachu', 'text me pictures of Chewbacca' and someone in Russia who is worried about what's eating wild and domestic raccoons. There is of course a downside to the Mystery Search fun. Some results probably aren't the sort of thing you want on your internet history. Take it from Redditor FlyAwayWithMeTomorrow, who said, "I'm stopping due to possibly highly legally questionable material showing up for my ISP in a search."

Huawei announced its flagship handset will gives users access to Amazon's Alexa assistant in the U.S., suggesting a new worry for Google, according to Reuters. An anonymous reader writes: "The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said." Analyst Jan Dawson at Jackdaw Research even told Reuters that if Google's personal assistant lags in popularity when voice becomes the most popular interface, "that's a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI, and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue." Tension may have started when Google decided to debut Google Assistant on their own Pixel smartphones. "While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. 'It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services.'" Nvidia announced this week at CES that they'd be using Google Assistant for their Shield TVs, while Whirlpool and Ford both announced Alexa-enabled products.

Hint: simplicity and price. Adam Levy (adamlevy) Jan 8, 2017 at 11:20AM Image source: Spectacles.com. Google made a lot of noise when it announced Google Glass at its developers conference in 2012. For its first demonstration, it had various extreme-sports athletes wear the head-mounted device while on a live Google Hangout video chat with Google co-founder Sergey Brin, and it had the tech world buzzing with anticipation. But within two years of launching the product, Google shut down Glass. Conversely, Snapchat parent company Snap has used guerrilla marketing tactics to generate strong interest in its Spectacles -- a pair of sunglasses that double as a camera linked to Snapchat. The company randomly drops a giant vending machine in a city, and people line up for hours to get their hands on the $130 device. Others have spent well over the retail price to buy a secondhand pair online. Snap has done what the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) company could not. It has made it cool to wear technology on your face. While Snap hasn't released any numbers about Spectacles sales, the above-retail pricing on eBay and lines at the vending machines indicates that they're popular. But it's not just clever marketing that's made Spectacles a hit. It's their specificity, and that can tell us a lot about the rest of the wearables market, too. What do you do with these things? Google Glass was a powerful device capable of doing a whole lot. The biggest problem it faced was that just because it could do something -- like provide weather data, set reminders, and dictate texts -- didn't mean people would want to use it for that. A regular smartphone worked just as well. Google Glass lacked a specific purpose. Even Google's live demo at its announcement with the extreme-sports athletes could have been done better with GoPro cameras. Instead, Google provided a platform and asked developers to come up with a reason you'd want to wear Glass on your face all the time. There's no question why you'd buy a pair of Spectacles. You want to share more photos and videos with Snapchat's 150 million daily users; that's all they do. Spectacles are quicker and easier to use for recording short snaps, especially while performing actions requiring the use of both hands or when you want to capture unplanned events in the moment. Fishing your phone out and loading the Snapchat app can take a long time. Spectacles are also capable of capturing video in Snap's new circular video format, which mimics human perspective.  That specific, limited purpose allows Snap to sell them at an affordable price point. Spectacles cost just $130 compared to the $1,500 Google asked for a Glass unit. The end result is a face wearable that feels more like a toy than the high-end technology of Google Glass. And that's a good thing. People buy toys somewhat impulsively, but they consider their options more carefully when buying a new computer, phone, television, or other piece of technology. As they should. Those things generally cost a lot more than toys. The same principle applies to wrist wearables This theory also apples to other types of wearables. Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) was once again the most popular wearable brand in 2016 and most of its wristbands are considered low-end fitness trackers. Its average sales price last quarter was $93. That's a price where consumers are willing to give the product a try and play around with it. It's a toy. Comparatively, the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch starts at $269, with prices climbing above $1,000. While the device is certainly more powerful than a Fitbit and has the potential to do a lot more, the best ideas Apple can come up with for uses are to track your fitness. In fact, its latest update focused specifically on new fitness-tracking functionality such as making it waterproof so it can track swimming activities. Why would you buy an Apple Watch if all you need is a fitness tracker? Why would you buy Google Glass when all you want to do is share videos and photos with your friends? Making a device for a specific use is not only cheaper, it makes the marketing and messaging clearer for consumers. That's evidenced in the fact that fitness bands accounted for 85% of wearable sales last quarter, according to IDC. That's the problem Apple currently faces with the Apple Watch. It can tout all of the technology it's stuffed inside that little wrist-worn device, but it can't give consumers a reason to buy it over one of its competitors. There will surely be a market for Apple's high-end device simply because of its brand and strong design aesthetic. But until Apple can provide a differentiating function over its lower-end competitors, its sales will continue to lag Fitbit and other low-end device makers. That could be cellular connectivity, making the devices more independent. It could come from enterprise support. And Apple has done a good enough job getting the device onto the wrists of millions that there's relatively strong developer support. So, it could come from a third-party application.

Its Pixel smartphones were the first Daydream-ready smartphones that were launched late last year alongside the Daydream View virtual reality headset. Other manufacturers will be able to support this platform as well and Google has highlighted a couple of new devices that have joined the Daydream family. There aren’t a lot of smartphones on the market right now that are Daydream-ready. Your options are largely limited to the Pixel or the Moto Z. However, that’s surely going to change in the coming months as more Daydream-ready handsets make their way to the market. In a post on its official blog, Google has highlighted four new devices that will soon join the Daydream family, they include the ZTE Axon 7, Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9, Huawei Mate 9 Pro and the ASUS Zenfone AR. Huawei has two smartphones on this list and it’s also has a Daydream-ready virtual reality headset in the pipeline that’s going to be launched later this year. The headset has an adjustable focus so it can be used without spectacles and it provides a 95° field of view. Google has gradually been releasing new Daydream-compatible apps as well to support the nascent platform. 2017 is certainly going to be the year in which we see Daydream evolve as a proper VR platform.

Cattaruzzi will lead the efforts to enable local business partners scale growth online and engage with consumers, as well as help the wider digital ecosystem through scalable programs and initiatives. “After eight years at Google, I am excited to start a new challenge within the company and look forward to working with some very talented Googlers here in the Dubai office,” Cattaruzzi said. “I find the MENA region to be truly fascinating and believe there is a lot more to be done in unlocking its digital potential. Since Google established its presence in MENA eight years ago, a significant effort went in successfully boosting the wide adoption of digital across large and small businesses in MENA.” Cattaruzzi comes with over twenty years of experience in the tech industry where he previously led the Google business in Mexico as Country Director and before that Argentina. He also spearheaded the global sales strategy team for online media solutions at Google’s headquarters in California, and was in charge of the online sales organisation for Germany, Switzerland and Austria while based out of Dublin.

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve matra x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ It might seem like an oldfashioned way of doing business. But three friends from IIT-Bombay — Rakesh Deshmukh, Sudhir Bangarambandi and Akash Dongre — swear by the virtues of five Ws and one H: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. “Keep asking questions and you will get answers, solutions and, yes, business,” grins Deshmukh, a serial entrepreneur and cofounder of Indus OS, which has emerged as the second largest smartphone operating system in India with over 6 million users and a 7.6% market share. While Google’s Android dominates with an 82.3% share, Chinese smartphone major Xiaomi comes third with its MIUI operating system cornering 5.1% and Apple’s iOS a distant fourth with 2%, according to a recent India smartphone report for the third quarter of 2016 by Counterpoint Research. What helped Indus — a little-known software company in Mumbai that customised Android to build a mobile operating system — in pipping Microsoft’s Windows and Apple’s iOS in India is finding answers to basic questions. Take, for instance, this one: Who all speak English in India? The answer — roughly 10% of the population — made the trio sit up. “It means 90% speak Hindi and regional languages,” says Deshmukh. The second question provided more fodder for their business plans. How do you get people to use their smartphones more often? The unanimous answer: make the handset accessible in local language or mother tongue. “The next 300 million smartphone users from emerging markets will be native language speakers,” says Deshmukh. The answers to the remaining four questions came from a user survey they conducted in October 2013 across 25 tier-I, tier-II and tier-III Indian cities. The findings were startling: over 79% of those surveyed were not satisfied with their smartphone experience; close to 52% used their smartphone for just basic applications like calls and messages; a staggering 72% preferred regional language content on their smartphones; and 37.5% were using a smartphone without having an email address. Mother tongue preference The concluding message of the survey was explicit: for first-time smartphone users, who are either migrating from a feature phone or no phone, the transition is overwhelming. The need of the hour, felt the Indus cofounders, was not only to simplify the smartphone experience but to have the entire ecosystem in the user’s native language. Deshmukh, Bangarambandi and Dongre cofounded Indus OS in May 2015. That was the time to answer another critical question: How to score some business? The immediate answer was to tie up with all desi handset makers. Over the past year and a half, Indus has struck alliances with Micromax, Celkon, Swipe, Karbonn and Intex, with the OS loaded in some 50 smartphone models, and available in 12 Indian languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Bengali and Urdu. Over threefourths of the models of Micromax — the second largest smartphone maker in India — have Indus, claims Deshmukh. The easiest way to make people realise the true potential of a smartphone is to have it in their preferred regional language, he adds. Deshmukh‘s contention is supported by recent research by the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) jointly with Kantar IMRB on smartphone and feature phone usage and behaviour. The study showed that 85% of feature phone users do not prefer switching to smartphones. Reasons: functional benefits, durability, battery life and ease of repair. Add language to the list, and it becomes clear why a multilingual operating system is needed in a country like India, says Deshmukh. What Indus has done, he claims, is not just cosmetic changes by having regional languages but substantial customisation. Take, for instance, its App Bazaar. An equivalent of Google Play, App Bazaar claims to be the world’s only regional app marketplace, provides over 50,000 applications to users in English and 12 regional languages, and has had over 15 million app downloads so far. What makes life simple for users is that they don’t need to have either an email ID or a credit/ debit card to download apps, as the amount gets deducted from their mobile carrier balance or added to their bills. An intuitive and simple user interface, transliteration of text from English to any regional language and matra prediction feature in the keyboard are some unique features of the operating system (see “App Bazaar...”). Experts says that Indus stands to gain most from the smartphone revolution in India. User interface is good, barrier to use technology is low, customisation in vernacular language is high, and all these have given it huge traction, says Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. “Though a customised Android, Indus has redefined the Android with a more vernacular experience,” says Pathak. But does Indus need to be wary of its parent, Google? Pathak doesn’t see any immediate threat. For a company like Google, he says, to allocate resources to all Indian languages might be too much to expect. “But the threat (over the long term) is always there.” Deshmukh, for his part, dismisses the threat. “We don’t see either Android or Google as a competitor,” he says, adding that Indus has made a 60% change in the Android source code to deeply integrate its technology. But the foundation remains the same: one can still use Google Maps, or Google Search, or Google apps. “We have not replaced any product that Android offers,” he says. When a new Android version is launched, he explains, the same version is released in Silicon Valley as well as in Satara in India. Digital awareness, language sensibility and availability of local content and services are overlooked by Android’s universal approach to developing a product, he says. Deshmukh says that while Android has a topdown approach to developing its features, Indus’s is bottom-up. While Google is a company of global nature and is applicable to multiple contexts, Indus is betting big on vernacular medium. Conceding that there was a gap in providing multilingual operating system, analysts says that the road is not going to be smooth for Indus as Google has already gauged the grey areas and is supporting 11 Indian languages. In fact, Google has already pressed the regional language mode button. Allo goes Hindi Last month, Google introduced Hindi language capabilities in its Google Allo smart messaging app. Launched in September last year, Allo uses Google Assistant and makes it easier for users to respond with features such as Smart Reply — it recognises the language a user is chatting in and begins to show suggested responses in that language. One has to just say ‘Talk to me in Hindi’ or adjust the language setting on one’s device to start using Google Assistant in Hindi. Apart from answers, Allo provides latest news, weather, traffic, sports and even information on ATMs, grocery stores and directions. It’s not only Google that has spotted gold in regional languages. Amazon exhibited its intent in December 2016 when it launched digital books in five Indian languages in Kindle. In September 2015, Apple added support for Hindi and Hinglish to its mobile platform iOS, as well as for several dialects, including Awadhi, Maithili and Santali. Clearly, it’s not going to be a cakewalk for Indus. “Indus OS now needs to move up the ladder and try coming out with the second level of value addition,” says Krishna Mukherjee, telecom analyst with Cybermedia Research. Indus, she adds, should also look at more tie-ups with device manufacturers, and impart mobile education to the nooks and corners of the country. Deshmukh is aware of the challenges. Indus has invested more than three years in researching and understanding the Indian context, and is an operating system that is “Made for India” by Indians, he avers. “This turns into the standout differentiation in the entire scenario.” With a large section of the population looking for smartphones to be accessible in their native languages, Indus OS is presenting a solution not provided by anyone else in the market, he adds. Google, as a brand, contends Deshmukh, is spread across geographies. When it comes to Android, it is a largely globalised product, and it is less pragmatic for them to have a niche offering. “The diversity of India — with 22 official languages — calls for a focused and a localised operational strategy.” From 6 million users now to an estimated 100 million users by 2020, Indus is optimising itself for an audacious play. While Indus has a 7.6% market share, Deshmukh points out that the combined share of its Indian handset partners is 35%. “We want to capture all this. And it’s doable,” he says. “Why should people buy phones if they can’t use it in their language?” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Some of the best domain name brokers sell millions of dollars worth of domain names each year. Brokers can be an essential part of the process of selling domain names, and there are quite a few domain brokers I respect and would use. It is very easy to become a domain broker. There are no qualifications required, there are no certifications needed, and literally anyone can call themselves a domain broker without any industry background or experience (do a Google or LinkedIn search to see how many there are!). As far as I know, there are no requirements for people to identify themselves as professional domain name brokers. It is because of this that due diligence is required before choosing a domain broker. I am fortunate to know quite a few exceptional domain brokers, but I thought I would share some thoughts on how I would go about choosing a domain broker if I did not have these contacts. For the purpose of this article, I am going to assume that a domain broker made the first contact with me to ask about selling one of my domain names or I did a Google/forum/blog search to find the names of domain brokers. Essentially, the assumption is I know the name of a broker but know nothing about that broker. The first thing I would do would when contacting a broker to sell a domain name is to ask for a list of domain names they sold. For privacy reasons, many can’t or won’t share sale prices. Most people in the business can distinguish a good name from a bad one, so knowing what was sold can give you an idea of the quality of names that broker sells. I would then ask the broker for the contact information of buyers and sellers for the domain names mentioned as sold. I would also ask both of those parties about their experience with the broker. It would be good to know how well the broker communicated, the types of marketing the broker did to sell the domain name, and ultimately, the level of satisfaction they have with the broker. Importantly, I would use the Whois database to make sure the references given match the buyer and seller email addresses so that the broker can’t give bogus information. I personally would not trust a domain broker who is unwilling to share domain names that he or she successfully brokered or references from satisfied customers. I understand the need for privacy, but in this case, it is important to know that the broker is legitimate and not simply using discretion as a means of not having to share this important information. I think a Google search of the broker’s name or company name can help reveal information about brokers. It can potentially lead to articles about the broker’s sales and perhaps some issues the broker had. Google would also likely show domain forum results that could help uncover information about the brokers, as shared by people in the domain investment community. I might call trusted companies in the industry as well as domain name lawyers to ask about individual brokers. Knowing how small the business of domain name investing is, I would imagine an industry lawyer or company representative can share whether a broker is trustworthy and good at brokering. Just because a domain broker is good does not mean they would be good for me or my domain name. Some brokers have great industry contacts and can sell well priced domain names very quickly. This might be good for someone looking to sell a domain name quickly, but it is not as helpful for someone with a high value domain name and no urgency to sell for the maximum value. Once I narrowed down my list of brokers to 2 or 3, I would ask for their expert valuations and likelihood of them selling the domain name and how long they think it might take to sell. Just because one broker shares a much higher valuation, it doesn’t mean that they will be able to sell the domain name. I would want to know their marketing plan for my domain name. Perhaps I would request a domain sale RFP to see how they will sell the domain name. I would ask to review their brokerage contract and make sure exclusivity period and commission structure is clear. I would also ensure that they use a third party escrow service like Escrow.com, Escrow.Domains, or Payoneer Escrow to close. I would not allow a broker to handle funds under any circumstance. Ultimately, I want to ensure several things when choosing a domain broker: The broker is trustworthy and a good communicator. The broker values the domain name as much as I value it. The broker has the ability to sell my domain name for my desired price. The broker is easy to work with. The broker is respectful and respected. The broker’s commission and exclusivity periods are clear and fair. The broker will not put my domain name at risk of legal issues. 7 Comments - Join Discussion Email This Article Topics: Advice, Domain Sales Tweet About The Author: Elliot Silver is an Internet entrepreneur and publisher of DomainInvesting.com.

It’s always good to do as much due diligence and digging as possible when it comes to handling someone else’s assets. Reply January 9th, 2017 at 12:39 am Mark Thorpe Everyone seems to be a domain name broker these days. There is a big difference between a good domain broker and a bad or new domain broker. If you are a domainer, you know who the good domain brokers are. There are also a lot more domain brokers now than domain Investors! Reply January 9th, 2017 at 1:18 am Jen Marchese Excellent advice, Elliot! Domains all seem to have the story straight on the best brokers, but end users often don’t know where to start. Interviewing brokers to find out who best matches your business style and who you feel you can most trust is essential, but this helps a lot in narrowing that field down and knowing what questions to ask. Reply January 9th, 2017 at 3:34 pm Joseph Peterson @Mark Thorpe, “Everyone seems to be a domain name broker these days.” That makes it sound like we have too many brokers … or that people acting as brokers are merely play acting – that somehow they’re not legit. In fact, there’s a dearth of brokers in the domain industry. Thousands upon thousands of sellable domains sitting around gathering dust. No attempt by the owners to match them with buyers. In many cases, the market value is below the threshold for brokers who depend on 15% commissions. But in the developing world, where the cost of living are lower, a smaller commission that “elite” brokers might sneer at would cover a whole month’s bills. Any smart, industrious person with good communication skills could be IMMENSELY helpful in shifting this stagnant inventory. And this is the vast majority of domainers’ domains we’re talking about here. As the largest English-speaking nation, India – I predict – will begin to take on this role. Web designers and SEOs will add domain brokerage to their list of services. And many of them will get good at it, training others to follow in their footsteps. This isn’t something to scoff at. It’s something to celebrate. We all benefit with more brokers. Personally, I’ll know this industry has reached saturation point once LinkedIn strangers stop asking me to sell their domains for them. Until I’m bombarded by offers from brokers who want to sell MY stuff, we don’t have too many brokers.

Cheers Reply In reply to Joseph Peterson | January 10th, 2017 at 1:26 pm Joseph Peterson @Mark Thorpe Conversations are boring where 1 person’s viewpoint is a redundant echo. If 2 people can’t differ, why talk? Reply In reply to Mark Thorpe | January 10th, 2017 at 11:32 pm Jonathan So right. There is is a world of domains bur sadly Americans with a wealth of foresight become nationalist Nellie the elephants.Look at the Chinese domain timeline: Baidu has released the latest (April)(2016) numbers on how Internet users come to a website Visit Method Percentage Direct 42.40% Referral 30.22% Search 24.27% Directory 2.34% Social media 0.77% This shows direct (type-in) traffic is the No. 1 source of visitors to a website, and this traffic is trending up as well, increasing from 41.68% in March to 42.40% in April. This means more and more Chinese users are using domain names directly to come to visit a website. On the contrary, source of visitors from search has dropped from 26.22% in March to 24.27% in April, showing the decreasing importance of search engines in China. Surprisingly, social media are practically insignificant in playing any role in this respect. Much to play for IMO Reply In reply to Joseph Peterson | January 11th, 2017 at 1:23 pm Leave a Reply Name * Mail * Website Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.

By Mordechai Guri , Yisroel Mirsky , Yuval Elovici On 1/8/17 at 11:10 AM Close Hacking Is A Booming Industry This article originally was published on The Conversation. It’s not often that any one of us needs to dial 911, but we know how important it is for it to work when one needs it. It is critical that 911 services always be available—both for the practicality of responding to emergencies, and to give people peace of mind. But a new type of attack has emerged that can knock out 911 access—our research explains how these attacks occur as a result of the system’s vulnerablities. We show these attacks can create extremely serious repercussions for public safety. Win an iPhone 7 Sign up to our daily newsletter for your chance to win. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> In recent years, people have become more aware of a type of cyberattack called “denial-of-service,” in which websites are flooded with traffic – often generated by many computers hijacked by a hacker and acting in concert with each other. This happens all the time, and has affected traffic to financial institutions, entertainment companies, government agencies and even key internet routing services. A similar attack is possible on 911 call centers. In October, what appears to be the first such attack launched from a smartphone happened in Arizona. An 18-year-old hacker was arrested on charges that he conducted a telephone denial-of-service attack on a local 911 service. If we are to prevent this from happening in more places, we need to understand how 911 systems work, and where the weaknesses lie, both in technology and policy. Understanding denial of service Computer networks have capacity limits—they can handle only so much traffic, so many connections, at one time. If they get overloaded, new connections can’t get through. The same thing happens with phone lines—which are mostly computer network connections anyway. So if an attacker can manage to tie up all the available connections with malicious traffic, no legitimate information—like regular people browsing a website, or calling 911 in a real emergency—can make it through. This type of attack is most often done by spreading malware to a great many computers, infecting them so that they can be controlled remotely. Smartphones, which are after all just very small computers, can also be hijacked in this way. Then the attacker can tell them to inundate a particular site or phone number with traffic, effectively taking it offline. Many internet companies have taken significant steps to guard against this sort of attack online. For example, Google Shield is a service that protect news sites from attacks by using Google’s massive network of internet servers to filter out attacking traffic while allowing through only legitimate connections. Phone companies, however, have not taken similar action. Addressing the 911 telephone system Before 1968, American emergency services had local phone numbers. People had to dial specific numbers to reach the fire, police or ambulance services—or could dial “0” for the operator, who could connect them. But that was inconvenient, and dangerous—people couldn’t remember the right number, or didn’t know it because they were just visiting the area. The 911 system was created to serve as a more universal and effective system. As it has developed over the years, a 911 caller is connected with a specialized call center—called a public safety answering point—that is responsible for getting information from the caller and dispatching the appropriate emergency services. Chris Kotzian works at his desk as a dispatcher for the city of Lakewood police department in Lakewood, Colorado March 31, 2010. Reuters These call centers are located in communities across the country, and each provides service to specific geographic regions. Some serve individual cities, while others serve wider areas, such as counties. When telephone customers dial 911 on their landlines or mobile phones, the telephone companies’ systems make the connection to the appropriate call center. To better understand how denial-of-service attacks could affect 911 call systems, we created a detailed computer simulation of North Carolina’s 911 infrastructure, and a general simulation of the entire U.S. emergency-call system. Investigating the impact of an attack After we set up our simulation, we attacked it to find out how vulnerable it is. We found that it was possible to significantly reduce the availability of 911 service with only 6,000 infected mobile phones—just 0.0006 percent of the state’s population. Using only that relatively small number of phones, it is possbile to effectively block 911 calls from 20 percent of North Carolina landline callers, and half of mobile customers. In our simulation, even people who called back four or five times would not be able to reach a 911 operator to get help. Nationally, a similar percentage, representing just 200,000 hijacked smartphones, would have a similar effect. But this is, in a certain sense, an optimistic finding. Trey Forgety, the director of government affairs for the National Emergency Number Association, responded to our findings in the Washington Post, saying, “We actually believe that the vulnerability is in fact worse than [the researchers] have calculated.” Policy makes the threat worse These sorts of attacks could, potentially, be made less effective if malicious calls were identified and blocked at the moment they were placed. Mobile phones have two different kinds of identifying information. The IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is the phone number a person must call to reach that phone. The IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) is used to track the specific physical device on the network. A defense system could be set up to identify 911 calls coming from a particular phone that has made more than a certain number of 911 calls in a given period of time—say more than 10 calls in the last two minutes. This raises ethical problems—what if there is a real and ongoing emergency, and someone keeps losing phone reception while talking to a dispatcher? If they called back too many times, would their cries for help be blocked? In any case, attackers who take over many phones could circumvent this sort of defense by telling their hijacked phones to call less frequently—and by having more individual phones make the calls. But federal rules to ensure access to emergency services mean this issue might be moot anyway. A 1996 Federal Communications Commission order requires mobile phone companies to forward all 911 calls directly to emergency dispatchers. Cellphone companies are not allowed to check whether the phone the call is coming from has paid to have an active account in service. They cannot even check whether the phone has a SIM card in place. The FCC rule is simple: If anyone dials 911 on a mobile phone, they must be connected to an emergency call center. The rule makes sense from a public safety perspective: If someone is having (or witnessing) a life-threatening emergency, they shouldn’t be barred from seeking help just because they didn’t pay their cellphone bill, or don’t happen to have an active account. But the rule opens an vulnerability in the system, which attackers can exploit. A sophisticated attacker could infect a phone in a way that makes it dial 911 but report it does not have a SIM card. This “anonymized” phone reports no identity, no phone number and no information about who owns it. Neither the phone company nor the 911 call center could block this call without possibly blocking a legitimate call for help. The countermeasures that exist, or are possible, today are difficult and highly flawed. Many of them involve blocking certain devices from calling 911, which carries the risk of preventing a legitimate call for help. But they indicate areas where further inquiry—and collaboration between researchers, telecommunications companies, regulators and emergency personnel—could yield useful breakthroughs. For example, cellphones might be required to run a monitoring software to block themselves from making fraudulent 911 calls. Or 911 systems could examine identifying information of incoming calls and prioritize those made from phones that are not trying to mask themselves. We must find ways to safeguard the 911 system, which protects us all.

It's a reflection of the sheer power that Amazon is starting to wield in the nascent smart home market, as a growing number of people come to rely on their Echo devices to run their homes and to automate their lives. The market for the Echo is still small compared to smartphones, but it's growing fast. Google already has the Google Home, its own voice-enabled speaker, designed to compete with the Amazon Echo. Microsoft partnered with Harmon to bring its Cortana virtual assistant to a smart speaker. Even Apple is rumored to be working on a dedicated Siri speaker. But so far Amazon is the smart speaker to beat, with an early start and plenty of buzz. Left to right: The Amazon Echo Dot, Echo Tap, and Echo devices all make Alexa available via voice commands. Business Insider More importantly though, the rise of the Echo heralds a changing tech landscape that could spell big trouble for Google. No matter how many Google Home devices the search giant sells, Google will be playing on a field that's tilted in Amazon's favor.  The rise of Alexa A big part of Amazon's early success with Alexa is due to the fact that the company didn't oversell it. After years of iPhone users getting let down by Siri, the first truly mainstream voice agent, Amazon billed the Echo as a speaker that, by the way, has a few smart voice commands built in. Then, just as people got accustomed to the idea of talking to Alexa, and positive word of mouth spread, Amazon added more capabilities. Alexa now boasts thousands of "skills" that allow it to connect with apps like Uber, Twitter, and Bloomberg news.  That's helped Alexa and the Echo speaker earn a position as the central hub in so-called smart homes. Alexa's voice-first interface is the perfect way to manage internet-connected lights, door locks, and thermostats — it's way more intuitive than having to pull out a tablet or phone every two seconds. BI Intelligence But here's the crucial part. The Echo also makes it super-easy to buy stuff, specifically stuff from Amazon. Alexa can play music from streaming services like Spotify, but it defaults to using Amazon's own Prime Music, which is a pretty key feature for a smart speaker. It's yet another reason for consumers to get a $99/year Amazon Prime subscription...which also gets you free shipping from Amazon, which encourages you to buy more from Amazon.  In other words, whatever else it does, the Amazon Echo is designed to make it easier for you to give more of your money to Amazon. And that slick voice interface for "skills" and for controlling all of your smart home gear ensures that you're always using the Echo and Alexa.  It's pretty genius, in a diabolical way. Versus Google This is where things get bad for Google.  The more Alexa devices that Amazon and its partners sell, the better Amazon does at its core retail business. Every Echo is a customer who is more likely to spend more on books, groceries, music, and movies.  Consider Google's position, though. It can sell as many Google Home devices as it wants. And it's true that Google is better at search than Amazon, by a country mile. But Google is a search advertising company, not a retail company, and those Google Home devices aren't delivering ads.  (Can you imagine if they did? "OK Google, open the garage door." "Okay, Matt, but listen to this ad for Mailchimp first.") Google Home Google Sure Google can use all the data it collects through its Google Home speaker to refine the ads people see on its search engine. But the point is that consumers will be spending less time in front of screens and looking at Google's search ads. No matter how good Google's search ads are, it doesn't matter if people aren't seeing them. In fact, we're already seeing some of this: Amazon is beating Google in the vital area of e-commerce search, because Amazon is the go-to destination for buying things. And thanks to the popularity of Amazon's Alexa, that's likely to continue. Voice technology is still in its very early stages, and smartphones aren't going away anytime soon. And none of this is to say that Google's problems are insurmountable. It wasn't so long ago that investors were convinced that Facebook couldn't monetize its mobile app. Today, Facebook is one of the primary mobile ad platforms. Google could certainly pull off a similar coup.  But the direction in which computing is moving is clear, and as things stand now, Google's weakness looks like Amazon's strength. And with Alexa on the rise, the clock is ticking for Google. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Hands-on-Hands-on+ Android-Android+ Asus-Asus+ CES2017-CES2017+ In the smartphone market, two new, yet popular features are virtual and augmented reality. Better known as VR and AR, they allow you to experience the world around you in brand new ways - either by escaping it entirely or by adding digital information into it. Virtual reality was first made popular in the smartphone world when Google Cardboard first came out over two years ago, and Google's other project by the name of Tango just recently ushered in the best augmented reality experience we've seen on a smartphone yet. While Cardboard/Daydream and Tango support is out there, you currently need to choose either one or the other. If you want support for both VR and AR experiences on your mobile device, you'll pretty much straight out of luck. Or are you? Asus announced new two entries for their ZenFone line a few days back, and one of those is that of the Asus ZenFone AR. Although it prominently features the AR name in its title, The ZenFone AR is the first smartphone to be announced that boasts support for both augmented and virtual reality experiences in one single device. We got a chance to spend some quality hands-on time with the ZenFone AR to see just what it's capable of, and although the software wasn't final, our initial impressions are quite positive. Design The Asus ZenFone AR and Lenovo Phab 2 Pro are currently the two only smartphones in existence that support Google's Tango AR platform, and the difference in design between the two devices is simply night and day. While the Phab 2 Pro is a big, gaudy metal-slate, the ZenFone AR is a lightweight and trim handset that is much easier to handle while still retaining a premium feel. To put things in perspective, the Phab 2 Pro's weight of 259-grams and width of 10.7-millimeters seem absolutely massive compared to the ZenFone AR's competing dimensions of 170-grams and 9-millimeters. The back of the Asus ZenFone AR features a faux-leather texture that's made out of plastic, and while it's technically not as premium as what you can get with an all-metal device, it's a bit refreshing to see a smartphone design that doesn't look like anything else that's currently available on the market. The back is also home to the ZenFone AR's TriCam camera system that makes the augmented reality experiences here possible, and the frame of the phone is constructed out of aluminum.  After handling the ZenFone AR for quite some time, the one word I can think of in relation to the phone's build is "impressive." The fact that Asus was able to cram in support for an entire augmented reality system with Tango in addition to Daydream support and everything else it's bringing to the table in such a thin and lightweight design is an incredibly feat on Asus's part. Display Virtual reality is the most enjoyable when you have a big, high-resolution display to view it with, and that's exactly the kind of screen we're dealing with here on the ZenFone AR. The size of the screen measures in at 5.7-inches, and Asus decided to go with a Super AMOLED panel with a resolution of 2560 x 1440. This combination creates for a pixel density of 515-pixels-per-inch, and in-person, the display here looks fantastic. The combination of Quad HD and Super AMOLED is one of the best duos you can get in a smartphone display, and that's no exception with the ZenFone AR. Colors are extremely rich and saturated, viewing angles are great, and everything seems to just pop our of the screen and punch you in the face.  User interface and processor Asus's ZenFone AR is running Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box with the company's own custom software skin layered on top of it, and the interface as a whole feels very smooth and snappy. Asus's tweaks to Android aren't the most aesthetically pleasing, but they don't slow the phone down and often times add additional functionality that isn't present in stock Android. However, with a phone like the ZenFone AR, the star of the show has to do with the interactions you make when partaking in Tango and Daydream experiences. Unfortunately, the units of the ZenFone AR that Asus had available for us to mess around didn't have a working version of Tango on them. Asus said that they're still working out some bugs and want to make sure that the experience is as smooth and error-free as possible when folks use it for the first time, so this is something we won't be able to comment on until our full review of the phone. The Asus ZenFone AR is the first phone to support both Daydream and Tango Asus did have Daydream View headsets out so that we could play with the virtual reality capabilities that are present here, and on the VR side of things, everything is in place for a great experience in a world outside of the real one Asus has partnered with Qualcomm to use an optimized version of the Snapdragon 821 processor so that Daydream functionality is as smooth and enjoyable as possible, and this move looks to have paid off. Everything moves at a nice, smooth pace, and thanks to the big gorgeous display being used here, video content and apps look fantastic as well. Along with the optimized 821 chipset, Asus has also outfitted the ZenFone AR with a whopping 8GB of RAM. That's right, 8GB. This is the first phone in the world to feature such a large amount of random access memory, and in addition to making both Tango and Daydream run as smoothly as possible, it should also allow for pretty much any other task to flow like butter. We weren't able to use the ZenFone AR too extensively during our time with it, but navigating throughout the phone's UI and opening and closing apps all ran without a hitch. Camera Support for Google Tango is only possible thanks to the camera setup that Asus has built into the ZenFone AR, and the company is dubbing this as their own TriCam system. As the name suggests, the TriCam setup on the ZenFone AR consists of three individual sensors, with the primary one being that of a 23MP nature. This is the camera that you'll use for snapping photos and recording video, and images we took with this camera turned out looking quite nice. We won't be able to fully judge what the primary camera is capable of until we get to spend more time with the ZenFone AR, but our initial impressions are very positive. In addition to the main 23MP sensor, the other two cameras that are present here are used for motion tracking and depth sensing. Tango features on the phone are made possible when all three of these cameras come together as one powerful package, but as I already mentioned, we weren't able to test out Tango capabilities on the ZenFone AR with the unit that we got to test out.

Battery Powering all of the tech that's packed into the ZenFone AR is a non-removable 3,300 mAh battery, resulting in a much smaller size than the massive 5,000 mAh battery that's housed in the ZenFone 3 Zoom. Asus hasn't said anything about how much use you can expect to get out of the ZenFone AR, but our assumption is that it isn't going to be a lot if you're making frequent use of the Daydream and Tango features that are present here. QuickCharge 3.0 is available for when you need to top up the phone, and Asus's own BoostMaster Fast Charging technology will supposedly be able to deliver a charge of 60-percent additional capacity after 39 minutes of charging time. Pricing and availability On the price and availability side of things, details are still pretty light for the ZenFone AR. Asus has said that we can expect the phone to launch at some point in Q2 of 2017, but that's all we currently know in these regards. Asus hasn't even said if the ZenFone AR will be coming to the States, but if it does, our guess is that it'll cost quite a lot.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Tech & Trend Huawei to launch Google's Project Tango AR-phone with 3D imaging; what we know so far Huawei is expected to launch Google Project Tango AR-phone by the end of 2017 or early 2018. Rohit KVN   January 8, 2017 16:16 IST [Representational Image] Huawei working on Google’s Project Tango AR-phone with 3D imaging.  Picture: Google's Project Tango-enabled phoneGoogle ATAP Taiwanese technology major Asus unveiled the second-generation Google Project Tango phone, dubbed Zenfone AR, at the ongoing international Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2017. Now, another Chinese telecommunication behemoth has shown interest in making a similar phone with Augmented Reality (AR) capability. Huawei told Android Authority at Las Vegas event that the company has plans to collaborate with Google to launch Project Tango in near future. As of now, there is no word on hardware specifications of the Huawei's device, but it is expected to be a top-end phone with latest and powerful components. Also read: CES 2017: Asus unveils Project Tango-enabled Zenfone AR and camera-centric Zenfone 3 Zoom; all you need to know What's so special about Project Tango-enabled phone? For the uninitiated, Google engineers took more than three years to turn Project Tango into reality. It was basically developed for AR gaming and architectural design purposes, and upon understanding the phone's potential, engineers tried to explore more areas and found that it can be employed for mapping and navigation in underground tunnels especially during exploring uncharted caves as well as sunken ships. As of now, besides gaming, immerse e-commerce experience has become huge hit in the market. Lenovo, which launched Google's first commercial Project Tango-phone Phab 2 Pro in November 2016, collaborated with popular retailer Wayfair, to offer a 3D-shopping experience. For instance, Wayfair's in-house AR app allows shoppers to visualise furniture and décor in their homes at scale before making a purchase, tackling one of the largest barriers to online shopping -- the inability to get a good sense for a product's aesthetic and how it would fit in. With AR technology, WayfairView app users can select furniture from an extensive 3-D catalogue, and virtually preview items in any of their rooms through the lens of a Lenovo Phab 2 Pro smartphone. Users will also be able to move and rotate products for an accurate rendering of an item's size and aesthetics. There's more... Future Google's Project Tango-enabled phones can be utilised as an auto guidance system for visually impaired people, as it can be used to give accurate navigation guidance, when blind people find themselves in uncharted places. For instance, while shopping for groceries, the smartphone can take you directly to the shelf containing the product you are looking for. We believe Huawei will be able to incorporate this feature to differentiate its future products with rival brands.

They expect high-quality, accurate answers. Late last year, it emerged that the top answer Google gave to “Did the Holocaust happen?” linked to a neo-Nazi, white supremacist, Holocaust-denying website. The ensuing outcry included people buying Google ads for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum so that it would appear near the top of the results as well. After initial resistance, Google tweaked its algorithm – but only enough to push the false, prejudiced information somewhat farther down in the results. These responses, however, miss a crucial element of the interplay between the tactics of Holocaust deniers’ tactics (and conspiracy theorists more broadly) and Google’s search algorithm. Google wants to answer questions, and is often very good at it. But when the question itself has a hidden or implicit agenda, like expressing doubt about historical facts, the urge to answer that question shifts from a strength to a weakness. Sowing doubts about the historical record is the bread and butter of Holocaust denial, and conspiracy theories more broadly. These illegitimate sites claim to be innocently curious, “just asking questions” about historical events and widely held beliefs. They are, of course, much more nefarious, seeking to spread anti-Semitism and right-wing hate. As a scholar of political sociology and the Holocaust, it’s clear to me that sites intentionally presenting misinformation and propaganda are preying upon Google’s eagerness to answer questions. These sites, peddling what is sometimes called “fake news,” capitalize on people’s tendency to ask those questions directly on Google. This is one important example of the real-world effects of how algorithms are written. Human programmers need to be aware that there can be actual social consequences when they write what can seem like dry, straightforward code. Many sites don’t answer the question First, and very importantly: Of course the Holocaust happened. There are mountains of evidence proving it happened. The perpetrators admitted to it. There are documents outlining the transport and extermination process. There is forensic evidence from the extermination sites. And there is abundant corroborating eyewitness testimony. But code matters: Google’s search algorithm uses more than 200 factors to figure out how to prioritize results so as to give users the information they’re looking for. One of the first things it looks at is how well the site’s content responds to the specific inquiry. For example, if a person searches for “running shoes,” Google doesn’t know, from the query, exactly what about running shoes the person is hoping to learn. So it will offer results ranging from reviews of running shoes to places selling running shoes. But asking whether the Holocaust happened is the equivalent of asking “Did World War II happen?” Understandably, legitimate sites don’t typically engage with the idea that it might not have. Despite being filled with detailed discussions of what, when, where, why, how and to whom the Holocaust happened, the most authoritative sites on the history of the Holocaust don’t address this one direct underlying question: Did it happen? They know it did, and elaborate from there. However, this appears to suggest to Google’s algorithm that those sites don’t have the most relevant information to answer the specific question a searcher is asking. This problem is amplified because Google’s algorithm attempts to evaluate sites’ credibility when determining where to include them in search results. When reputable sites don’t seem to provide the answer, less trusted sources that offer direct – though false – responses are able to rise to the top of the search results. Making matters worse, the algorithm uses machine learning to offer related suggestions about what the searcher might be looking for, even if they don’t use the exact search terms. An initial query premised on Holocaust denial will trigger the system to provide more options like it. A way for experts to respond Taken together, the way that deniers frame questions and the Google algorithm’s desire to answer specific questions combine into a recipe for spreading conspiracy theories across the internet. However, Google’s emphasis on credibility means that experts have avenues for addressing these issues: public writing, blogging and linking to factually accurate work. If the Holocaust Museum were to write an article titled “Did the Holocaust happen?” and provide some basic facts, the content and the site’s credibility would move it to the top of the search results. Its current page confronting Holocaust denial could even be quickly modified to add a line saying “Often this denial comes in the form of a question: ‘Did the Holocaust happen?’” That would introduce the keywords that could boost the existing page’s relevance to Google’s algorithm. (Whether due to additional tweaking on Google’s part, or its algorithm’s response to news coverage, Holocaust Museum content is, as of this writing, much more prominently displayed in Google’s results.) To be sure, this will not eliminate Holocaust denier websites from Google’s search results entirely, and perhaps not even from the first page of them. Nor will it deter dedicated deniers from finding information that supports their preconceived notions about history. Holocaust denial is based on a selective interpretation of the historical record and deep-seated anti-Semitic beliefs. No website will correct or uproot these beliefs in one fell swoop. However, offering accurate information alongside false information may give individuals who have yet to internalize these beliefs pause. And it suggests a useful path to those who seek to disseminate truth and fact in the face of denial and conspiracy theories.

Sprint is the first carrier partner for Google in an effort to bring RCS to its Android devices. RCS on Sprint will enable enhanced messaging features on Android phones like better group messaging, high resolution photo sharing, advanced file transfer, typing indicators and read receipts. RCS is a GSM Association program which was created by GSM Association in order to create an inter-operator communication services based on IP Multimedia Subsystem. Google acquired RCS provider Jibe Mobile in September 2015. And the Jibe cloud platform will power new RCS service for Sprint. RCS could be described as SMS messaging on steroids. It’s a standard which modernizes SMS and brings many advanced features currently available only on messaging apps. These includes group chats, read receipts (pingbacks indicating that message was read by recipient) and typing indicators. It could also transfer images and files many times larger than what is currently supported by MMS. It also features support for group messages which allows users to create new groups, join groups and leave groups when needed. Those Sprint customers who use select LG and Nexus phones will get an automatic update while other customers will have to install update manually from the Play Store by downloading Messenger app from the app store. New Pixel phones from Google has Messenger app preloaded so for all customers with Pixel phones on Sprint RCS will be enabled by default. Also beginning next year every Android Spring phone will come preloaded with Messenger app and RCS enabled. RCS is another step by Google to compete with Apple iMessage infrastructure. The problem though is that adoption of RCS is currently limited and users on Sprint with RCS won’t be able to effectively use it with users on other mobile providers. Google promised to enable RCS on other mobile providers in “coming months”. In order to use RCS on Android phone users will have to use Messenger app. This app is different from Allo app which Google promotes and which has AI intellectual assistant. Allo works cross-platform but given its late entry to already saturated messenger market it may have problems competing with existing messengers.

He had just been at IIT Kharagpur two weeks, didn't speak much Hindi as he "came from the South" and had been trying to pick it by listening to how others around him spoke. "In my first couple of weeks I thought you called people that way," he said with a wide grin. "The next thing I know the folks in the mess were quite upset and they shut down the mess. I wasn't very popular that day," recalled Google CEO Sundar Pichai as he regaled an amphitheater full of IIT Kharagpur students with his tales from 23 years ago. Polite to a fault, genteel and — for a man who runs the world's second most highly-valued company — he is down-to-earth, and amazingly particular about being respectful to everyone in the room. But was there another side to him as well, asked the "fire-side" chat moderator, Hitesh Oberoi, co-promoter, managing director and CEO of Info Edge. Did he bunk morning classes? "Of course," came the answer. "It's a rite of passage in college," said Pichai. "I have to say I worked hard but we had our share of fun." On hostel memories and ragging As we walked back into time with Pichai to his old hostel room B-308, in the B-west wing of Nehru residence hall, you could see he was visibly moved. "Could you give me a moment, please," he politely requested the crowding camera crews, trying hard to gather his emotions as he looked around his old room and met its current occupants. "It looks remarkably the same," he told us a few moments later, as we walked through the corridor outside, just a "little bit cleaner." "We used to play cricket here and all the glass windows would constantly get broken," said the man who runs Google. "In winter, it used to get cold so we used to tape it up with paper. I made Maggi late in the night around here," he pointed with relish to a corner. Was he ragged? "A little, but it was all in good spirit...As a freshman you lock your room and you go out and when you come back your room doors aren't open but everything inside has been rearranged, even the furniture. So it is quite a shock." On travelling third class, and Project Nilgiri Later as we walk down Kharagpur's railway junction, and he reminiscences about the time when he used to catch the Coromandel Express from here to Chennai, we also sample the high-speed free Wi-Fi that Google has enabled at the station as part of its promise to Prime Minister Modi under the Digital India project. Under a project that Googlers internally call Project Nilgiri, Wi-Fi connectivity was to be enabled at 400 of India's biggest stations. How many have been connected so far? "In the first year, our goal was 100. We completed 110, and we look forward to doing more." The project has thrown up some very interesting trends. Data usage shows that Bhubaneswar railway station, for example, started getting more footfalls than Bombay Central, because students started coming in to hang out and use the Wi-Fi. "I find in rural areas, people actually come into the stations so they can use internet," added Pichai. "It shows the demand Indian users have." Bridging the digital divide Later, as we walk into Gokulpur, one of 60,000 villages in 10 states where Google has been training women volunteers (called Google saathis to use mobile phones) he listens intently to the women. With only 1 in 10 rural women an internet user, the digital divide is also a gender divide. So what has he learnt from the village women, we ask. "Something like this you don't fully internalize till you experience," he says. "You ask them what they would like to see and they say a puja, or god or a temple and they see it. That's what draws them to internet. Then they find recipes, health information and so on and they all want more of it." On failing and learning The first time he sat on a plane was when he went to the US to study at Stanford. Has India's education system changed since and how should it change? Pichai weighs in on the side of creativity and learning by experimenting. As he told his student audience in Kharagpur, "I get surprised when I hear people start preparing for IIT in 8th grade. I hope they are really taking time to do things in a deeper way, understanding things deeper and learning by doing things. Setbacks actually don't matter...It's important to keep your dreams and follow those. Most of how life plays out is up to you and not on what happens outside of you. Take the long view." What is his advice to students? "It is important to get real world experience. In the US, like at Stanford, most people don't choose their major till their final year. They do different things and find out what they are really passionate about...Academics is important but not as important as it is made out to be." Later as he picks up a bat to knock a few balls around at an impromptu pitch in Gokulpur, he says he didn't make it to his hostel cricket team but loved to watch Gavaskar bat. Who is his favourite today? "Watching Virat Kohli through the last year has been pretty amazing. I didn't think somebody could have an average of over 50 in all three forms of the game," he signs off. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Add the frequency and timing and your digital coach is ready to remind you. Connect to Google Fit or Apple Health and you won’t have to remember to record that you’ve completed the activity. Samsung Gear and Under Armour Apps Another announcement this week brings the integration of Under Armour Fitness apps to Samsung’s range of Gear wearables. In 2015 Under Armour bought both Endomondo and MyFitness Pal to add to its fitness apps. The latest announcement will see Under Armour’s suite of apps made available on Samsung devices, with the exact timing of the release dependent on the device. Weight Watchers App If you want to drop those extra holiday pounds, tracking what you eat will help. The Weight Watchers app lets you be as public or as private as you like — you can share your healthy eating and weight-loss goals, successes and setbacks or you can treat it as a personal diary. Plus connected recipes and other advice makes it easy to come up with ideas for eating well and it tracks your activities through FitPoints with a weekly goal. Runkeeper Runkeeper has been the go-to activity tracking apps for more than 40 million users, including me, for a number of years. Most recently it has been updated to work with the Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Nike+ GPS tracking. This means if you have the wearable you don’t have to take along your phone when you’re running, cycling or doing one of the other activities Runkeeper monitors. (Despite the name, you don’t have to be a runner to use it — I use it for walking and cycling.) It integrates directly with your music app —  iTunes and Spotify on iOS or with Android devices, music apps will play along while you’re using Runkeeper. Strava This is the app for you if you’re into serious training. A social media app for athletes, along with following friends or training buddies, it lets you follow professional athletes. Track your own training and follow the pros. In last summer’s Olympic Games, gold medal-winning cyclist Greg Van Avermaet uploaded his Rio race and got 14,000 kudos, among the 1.3 million kudos bestowed through the app over the year. It’s Strava’s version of getting a like. There’s a free version and a premium version with extra features including live feedback and customized-training programs. It works with iPhones and Android phones as well as a number of apps and wearables. In its latest news, Strava, along with Google and Intel, has teamed up with New Balance in a new smartwatch called RunIQ.   FITNESS APP A DIGITAL MIRROR FOR ASSESSING YOUR HEALTH Whether you’re a long-time health nut or just resolving to shed a few holiday pounds, there are plenty of fitness apps out there vying for your attention. The challenge is to find the right app that will help, not hinder, your health goals. “The app might be safe for everyone else. But it has to be safe for you,” says Dr. Kendall Ho. Dr. Kendall Ho, UBC eHealth, with an iPhone app that reads ones heart rate, Gerry Kahrmann Gerry Kahrmann / Vancouver Sun Ho, a professor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of B.C., has been working with Vancouver General and St. Paul’s hospitals to better incorporate health and fitness technology into patient treatment, and to help patients manage their own health better through the use of such apps. Fitness and health apps are popular because they act as a “digital mirror,” giving individuals a snapshot of where they’re at in their specific health goals, says Ho. Apps can guide people through workouts and meditation, record dietary intake and monitor sleep cycles to let you know if you’re getting enough restful sleep. “I think what the apps and wearables do is, for the first time, help a person to understand his or her own body,” says Ho. He notes this comes in handy when self-evaluating fitness goals, modifying behaviour to reach those goals and monitoring progress. Related How to get healthier in 2017 If you have an existing medical condition, it’s important to consult a doctor to see if the app will support your goals or if its design will push you beyond your body’s safe limits, says Ho. Also keep in mind that if a fitness app isn’t easy to use, it’s not likely to become a regular part of your fitness routine. Ho notes any app that is too complicated won’t help create healthy habits and might actually throw you off entirely. He recommends starting with the basics, such as an app to record nutritional intake, monitor physiological state and, if you require it, something to record your medications and prescriptions. — Stephanie Ip CLICK HERE to report a typo.

At CES in Las Vegas, the company announced that it’s bringing Assistant to your TV, as well as Android Wear smartwatches and in-car entertainment systems. Google’s rival to Siri and Alexa will become available on Android TV-based televisions and set-top boxes running Android Marshmallow 6.0 or newer, to do things like playing content from Netflix, searching YouTube for specific videos, control your connected home devices such as lights and speakers, and ask questions like “What are mastodons?” and “How long will it take me to get to work?” “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY That means you won’t need a Google Home to enjoy the benefits of having Google Assistant around – simply turn on your TV and you’ll be able to invoke it by saying, “OK Google”. The feature will become available in the coming months in the US on devices like the Nvidia Shield, Xiaomi Mi Box, and Android TVs like Sony’s Bravia screens. While some of these will require a voice remote, the Nvidia Shield will work completely hands-free, so you can wake Assistant from anywhere in the room without picking up a device. The company noted that over time, Assistant will also show up in smartwatches running Android Wear 2.0, as well as other types of devices that take advantage of the Embedded Google Assistant SDK. With that, Google is set to take the voice assistant fight to Amazon, which has been working feverishly to make Alexa ubiquitous across a range of connected devices from various hardware makers – including TVs. However, Google is gunning for more than that: It recently unveiled Android Things, an OS for Internet of Things devices that will integrate with a range of its cloud-based services. As such, it might be able to offer customers more control over all their gadgets with a unified interface in the months and years to come – and keep rivals at bay.

Testing started on this in November, and is set to launch globally in early 2017.  Although Google has said overall ranking impact should be minimal, those sites which have less or different content on their mobile version than on their desktop version may see quite an impact once Google takes only the mobile page in consideration. Sites that have no mobile version at all should see no or little change; they will continue to undergo the same ranking process for desktop results and the same "not mobile friendly" dampening for mobile search as it does now. A History Of Google’s Affinity For Mobile-friendliness For nearly two decades Google has used the desktop version of websites to determine relevance and other ranking signals in order to populate its search index, however for the last 7 years we have started to see this shift. 2009-2010: Early signs appeared that Google, would create universal indexing for mobile and desktop search results. As it began to follow a similar pattern seen in the early 2000’s when Google first combined video, image, and text search results. 2011-2012: Google hinted at, and then went on record saying that the preferred method for crawling and indexing mobile content is through responsive design. 2013: Google revealed further recommendations for making websites mobile friendly, which focused on responsive design, fast loading pages, and user experience. 2014: Google introduced mobile friendly tags in its search results to make it easier for mobile searchers to find mobile optimized content, further stressing the importance of mobile-friendly design. 2015: Google announced they would be expanding their use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal. This change affected mobile searches globally and had a significant impact on search results. 2016: In early 2016 Google announced its plans for mobile-first indexing, and in November commenced testing. Google also launched Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) with the mobile searcher in mind. Preparing For Mobile-First Indexing With Mobile-Friendly Design For years Google has given preference to mobile-friendly websites in mobile search rankings, and making website’s mobile-friendly should have already been a priority in all SEO strategies. Content that’s not mobile-friendly doesn’t perform as well on mobile. As more people continue to use mobile devices to conduct searches Google wants to make results more useful to mobile users.  Which means that Google will primarily use the mobile version of a site’s content to rank pages, even when searches are conducted on a desktop. Here are three important considerations when preparing for the mobile-first indexing. 1. Responsive Design Google's preference is responsive website design, which automatically adjusts the website to the screen size of the visitor. It is the method of design that provides the most consistent and optimal user experience, because it uses the same website content and the same web addresses across all devices. This makes it more efficient for search engines to crawl a site, and also makes it easier for visitors to engage with and share content. 2. Website Speed In 2010 Google announced that its next-generation architecture for Google's web search is the first step in a process that will let them push the envelope on indexing speed, accuracy, and comprehensiveness. With Google acknowledging the need to crawl and index pages quicker to meet real time search demands, Google weighted load times as an element to rankings. As mobile searches continued to increase Google is now working on adding mobile-specific page speed as a factor. In both cases, desktop and mobile, we're talking about page speed as a dampening ranking factor, not a ranking boost: very slow sites get demoted but very fast sites don't automatically get promoted. 3. Engagement Through user engagement metrics, and machine learning, search engines make assumptions about the relevancy of site content to a specific search and rank it accordingly. This includes a look at dwell times, the number of pages viewed, and bounce rates. Even if website content is relevant but the user experience is poor, it will create engagement signals that will have a negative impact on search results. As a result of poor mobile experiences, many websites have mobile engagement performance metrics that are lower than desktop. This could negatively impact overall traffic and conversions when the mobile-first indexing is launched. Predicting The Impact Of Mobile-First Indexing If your site is already responsive according to Google’s standards, there is not much you will need to change.  But you still want to compare your mobile performance to competitors, as well as your desktop to mobile performance, to understand the overall impact to rankings, traffic, and conversions. There are multiple data sets for you or your digital agency to look at to provide these insights. If the content on your mobile website is different than your desktop content, then ideally you should be working to create a responsive website or otherwise include as much of your desktop's content on your mobile site as Google "will eventually primarily use the mobile version of a site’s content to rank pages from that site, to understand structured data, and to show snippets from those pages in our results" Hand-Picked Related Articles: Analyzing Google’s Latest Mobile Friendly Update 5 Tools To Test If Your Website Is Really Mobile Friendly The Ultimate Guide To Mobile Site Speed Optimization * Adapted lead image: Public Domain, pixabay.com via getstencil.com By Tammy Graham|2016-12-23T07:09:50+00:00January 6th, 2017|Mobile, SEO|0 Comments About the Author: Tammy Graham A hands-on senior marketing leader and early digital adapter with who excels in fast-pace environments, driving aggressive growth targets.

An anonymous reader quotes InfoWorld: Grumpy, an experimental project from Google, transpiles Python code into Go, allowing Python programs to be compiled and run as static binaries using the Go toolchain... In a blog post announcing the open source release, Google stated the project stemmed from its efforts to speed up the Python-powered front end for YouTube. But Google hit an obstacle that's familiar to folks who've deployed Python in production: It's hard to get CPython -- the default Python interpreter written in C -- to scale efficiently. "We think Grumpy has the potential to scale more gracefully than CPython for many real world workloads," writes Google... Because it doesn't support C extensions, Grumpy doesn't have CPython's Global Interpreter Lock, which is commonly cited as a roadblock to running Python concurrent workloads smoothly. Grumpy also uses Go's garbage collection mechanisms to manage memory under the hood, instead of CPython's. Grumpy creates close interoperation between Python and Go by allowing Go packages to be imported and used with the same syntax as Go modules. google python developers ← Related Links → TV News Broadcast Accidentally Activates Alexa, Initiates Orders Interviews: Guido van Rossum Answers Your Questions Python/Unix Hybrid Demoed at PyCon Google's Go Language Surges In Popularity Python 3.6 Released Apple Could Finally Sell More Devices Than Microsoft In 2017 Google Boosts Python By Turning It Into Go More | Reply Login Google Boosts Python By Turning It Into Go Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

It'll die just because Google supports it...because Google has no issues with throwing away stuff as soon as they lose interest, no matter how many people are invested in it. Pretty much every established language can do the stuff the new languages do. It doesn't mean they do them well, or that they can't be improved upon or that we should simply live with the flaws in those languages even if they cause untold numbers of errors in production code. A simple example would be C and C++'s never ending supply of bugs related to dangling pointers, memory leaks etc., many of which are caused by inherent default choices in the language. While I don't program Go myself it clearly demonstrates a number of advantages for writing multi-threaded, high availability, high performance applications than some other languages.

Of course it has a runtime. Where else would the garbage collection that you just mentioned be implemented? Or GoRoutines. Or reflection. I think you're confusing not having a runtime with having the Go compiler statically link the runtime into each executable. That has some benefits that you were alluding to (e.g. "no baggage") but it also has drawbacks such as increased executable size, increased memory usage (with a dynamic runtime, different instances all share the same library in memory), decreased cache usage (since if you have two Go executables, they are constantly evicting each others runtimes from cache, even though they are identical and could be shared) and the maintenance issues having to recompile to take advantage of security/bug/performance improvements in the runtime itself. I have no issue if you claim that in some (your) use cases the advantages of a statically compiled runtime are worth the disadvantages. But that's not the same as claiming that either the runtime doesn't exist or that it's always advantageous.

LinkedIn's website was blocked by Russia in November of last year, as the service was said to have violated data localization laws.  ( Carl Court | Getty Images ) Advertisement Russia has demanded Apple and Google to take down the app of LinkedIn, the professional social networking website that was blocked in the country last year, from local app stores. The move mirrors China's request for Apple to remove apps by The New York Times from the country's App Store. LinkedIn Taken Down From App Stores In Russia Smartphones users in Russia, whether they are using iOS or Android devices, will no longer be able to download the LinkedIn app after the country's government demanded Apple and Google to remove the app from the Russian versions of the App Store and the Google Play Store. According to a report by The New York Times, the demand of Russia to take down LinkedIn from the country's app stores places Apple and Google in a difficult position, as both of them push for free speech and an open internet, but are being asked to be agents of censorship for the government. The removal of the app from app stores, along with the previous blocking of the website, will not be enough to completely cut off access to LinkedIn's content from within Russia, due to the presence of other methods such as using a VPN. However, the move sends a signal that countries such as Russia and China have the power to demand major tech companies such as Apple and Google to take down apps. Why Was LinkedIn Blocked In Russia? LinkedIn, owned by Microsoft, was blocked in Russia after a court ruling claimed that the professional social networking website violated the country's data laws. According to the data laws of Russia, websites could only store and process personal information of its citizens within Russian servers. LinkedIn, which had more than 6 million users in the country, did not meet this requirement. According to a spokesperson for Roskomnadzor, the regulatory watchdog for communications and IT, LinkedIn did not respond to requests for the relocation of the professional social network's servers to Russia. As such, it was ruled that internet service providers in Russia should block public access to the LinkedIn website. LinkedIn is considered to be the biggest service to have so far been affected by Russia's data laws. However, while the data localization requirements of Russia can be considered as aggressive, the country is just one of 13 countries which implement some form of such a law. The United States is one of these countries, as the government requires partners of the Department of Defense to store their data on local servers. Growing Tension Between Russia And The United States The removal of LinkedIn's apps in the app stores of Apple and Google in Russia will likely contribute to the growing tension between the country and the United States. Just as 2016 was drawing to a close, the United States government officially accused Russia of interfering with the 2016 presidential election through a series of hacking attacks that had the Democratic National Committee as one of its targets. The outgoing Obama administration issued sanctions against two Russian intelligence agencies and expulsions against 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives. The Russian government, however, decided not to retaliate against the sanctions and expulsions, with President Vladimir Putin saying that the country will instead plan the restoration of relations between the two governments once the Trump administration is seated.

The giant staircase leading up on the side of a massive Antarctica mountain might have been used by ancient alien visitors or space invaders in UFO crafts as a landing site, conspiracy theorists speculated. The origin, nature, and purpose of the giant staircase, spotted on Google satellite imagery, sparked a debate in a popular UFO conspiracy theory forum recently, according to Express. The forum member who discovered the mystery staircase said he stumbled upon it while exploring Google Earth following a debate about why prominent U.S. and world citizens, such as the former NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, and the Russian Patriarch Kirill, visited Antarctica recently. “This morning, in the work van, we were talking about conspiracies… so I pulled out Google Earth [and] came across something that looked like a giant staircase.” Proof of aliens? Giant staircase found in Antarctic may be UFO landing site or lost Atlantis pyramids https://t.co/JnVkejETT8 pic.twitter.com/40Xi3PrGj6 — Daily Express (@Daily_Express) January 8, 2017 Although some members of the conspiracy theory forum suggested that the alleged giant Antarctica staircase could be ripple patterns caused by a glitch in the satellite imagery, many members of the forum argued that it was a UFO landing site. They argued that it might have been equipped in ancient times with a navigational beacon that sent out signals to approaching alien UFOs. Forum members suggested that the giant staircase might have marked a take-off and landing pathway for ancient alien UFOs making multiple journeys between Earth and outer space. “It does look like stairs – maybe on a pyramid structure?” “I’m not an alien believer but I do believe we’ve been all over this planet many times in our past.” “It’s more likely a landing site than stairs.” “I attribute it to fallen angels and Nephilim… high-tech demonic activity.” “Why does it look like it says Google next to the stairs?” “Someone wrote Google in the snow next to it.” The argument that the giant staircase-like structure, leading up on the side of a massive Antarctica mountain, could be a landing site for UFOs borrows inspiration from decades-old speculation among paranormal enthusiasts that ancient pyramids and staircase structures, such as the famous Egyptian step pyramid of Saqqara, also known as the Pyramid of Djoser, and the Pyramids of Giza, were used as navigational beacons to guide ancient alien UFOs visiting Earth to a safe landing. According to paranormal researchers, technologically advanced alien visitors to Earth taught the people of ancient civilizations, such as Egypt, Sumer, Maya, and Inca, how to build the pyramids. #ufosfacts The Great Pyramid, Atlantis and Greenwich, the Secret Is Discovered ENG SUB: Here, as… https://t.co/EN9bwLB937 #ufos #ufosfacts pic.twitter.com/JLwCiydb2S — UFOSFACTS (@UfosFacts) December 15, 2016 But archaeologists, historians, and anthropologists believe that the structure of ancient pyramids, including the Pyramid of Djoser, suggests they were symbolic of the ascent of the soul of the pharaoh to divine heights of immortality. Some believe that step pyramids could also signify divine incarnation as the symbolic pathway that the soul of a god follows in the descent to earthly realms. ‘Snow pyramid discovery’ in Antarctic, and giant staircase – https://t.co/GqSVEFR87e pic.twitter.com/6hDQzo5vhA — Mary Sutton Greeley (@Lucky_finds) January 8, 2017 But conspiracy theorists claim that new discoveries on NASA and Google satellite images reveal that Antarctica was the site of advanced ancient civilizations that flourished thousands of years before the emergence of other ancient civilizations, such as Egypt and Sumer. The ancient Antarctica civilizations had contact with extraterrestrial civilizations and built UFO spacecraft based on advanced alien technology. They also left massive civil engineering monuments buried under Antarctica ice and snow. And although much of the ruins remain buried beneath ice and snow, evidence of their existence is coming to light through recent NASA and Google satellite imagery. https://t.co/1jDcnFgRmM : #Antarctic #UFO – ‘Giant Antarctic staircase’ could be ‘UFO landing site or lost Atlantis #pyramid’ pic.twitter.com/rN7XHtPkbs — Mohamad Dery (@MdeeyNRS) January 8, 2017 Some conspiracy theorists argue that Antarctica might have been the location of the legendary lost city of Atlantis. The Inquisitr reported that UFO conspiracy theorists claimed recently that they found in Google Earth satellite imagery evidence of an ancient city buried in Antarctica ice. According to enthusiasts, a massive, circular, 400-ft structure that looks like a fort, spotted beneath Antarctica ice in satellite imagery, gives evidence of a lost ancient city and civilization that once flourished on the frozen continent. Satellite imagery, according to enthusiasts, also reveals multiple massive artificial pyramid structures in Antarctica. The Inquisitr also reported that UFO hunters claimed recently that the U.S. government is aware of the existence of extensive ruins of ancient Antarctica civilization and that the former NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin was sent to Antarctica recently to find the ruins. UFO and E.T. enthusiasts speculated that Aldrin might have visited Antarctica to investigate reports that advanced alien technology that could take human astronauts to Mars in a very short time could be found beneath the ruins of ancient Antarctica civilization. “Buzz Aldrin is the guy who talked about the spaceships out by the moon when he was there. So why did they send him to Antarctica?” a forum member asked. “To see if it’s the same ships he saw,” the forum member concluded. UFO and paranormal enthusiasts also claimed that the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited the frozen continent recently to inspect the ruins of ancient civilizations and remains of advanced alien technology left by the alleged ancient civilizations. Some theorists claimed that Kerry also visited secret government-known alien space program bases in Antarctica. The alleged secret space program bases date back to World War II when the U.S. government took over old Nazi underground bunkers and facilities where Third Reich scientists conducted secret space technology research with the help of advanced extraterrestrial species. After World War II, the U.S. government modernized and extended the old Nazi facilities, allegedly under a secret technology transfer agreement that President Dwight Eisenhower signed with the alien species in 1954.

The latest was a major December update aimed at improving the game. There’s plenty to love about the latest changes, but it’s also causing problems for some. Here we’ll explain how to fix the “Device is not compatible” error while trying to update Clash of Clans on Android. Additionally, we have more details about Google accounts not syncing correctly for saved villages. Advertisement It’s one of the most popular titles on Android and iOS. Millions of people play it daily. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this error message, but recently it has been happening more frequently. Most other issues can be fixed with the instructions below. Read: Clash of Clans Updates: 7 Things We Want Next The last update added tons of level 11 troops, cheaper costs and other things. However, it also added some problems. In fact, some can’t update the game at all. As a result it can’t be played. This is a big issue, and hopefully the few suggestions below can help. Advertisement Advertisement If you haven’t updated you’ll see a notification upon launching the game that an update is available. You cannot play until you accept this, go to the Google Play Store, and update to the latest version of the game. Everything is fine for those on iOS, but Android users are being met with a very odd problem. Users are getting an error on the Google Play Store for Clash of Clans that says, “Device is not compatible with this version” and are unable to update. Supercell confirmed this is a problem, and has offered up a fix for those having issues. Players affected by "Your device is not compatible with this version", please try: Settings >App Manager>Google Play Store>Clear data/cache — Clash of Clans (@ClashofClans) January 26, 2016 If you can’t update, you can’t play. Some are even in an active Clan War and can’t update in order to fight before time runs out. Which as many can imagine, would be very frustrating. Update: On February 26th Supercell made some changes and had another small maintenance break to fix the device incompatible and other Google services issues. Let us know in the comments below if the problem is still going on. Advertisement Update #2: On March 4th Supercell finally fixed the Google Play Store device not compatible Clash of Clans problem, as well as the Google Games ID and sync issue many users have been experiencing. According to them, those who were unable to sync their Google Games account to restore or save a village, and the thousands of users who couldn’t update, should all be able to download the latest update from the Google Play Store release late last night and this morning. Head into the Play Store, check for updates, and download it right now to get back to Clashing. Update #3: The new December Clash of Clans update made this issue appear again. Users have also experienced crashes while in global chat, chat logs being out of order and other small things. Supercell may release another optional update to fix this. Even people that have been using the same device for well over a year are having issues. We’re seeing reports all over Twitter that people with tablets, the LG G3, Galaxy S6 and other devices are all experiencing this error. I’ve updated a Galaxy S7, Nexus 6P, Pixel C tablet and Nexus 9 all without any problems. So we’re not sure what is causing this at the moment, or what Android devices are experiencing it. been playing #COC on the same phone for 3 months and today its telling me that my device is not compatible with this version @ClashofClans — EllisWard✌️ (@fan_paige_wwe) January 26, 2016 Advertisement If you are trying to update Clash of Clans on an Android device but running into problems, there are a few potential fixes. There is either something messed up with the Google Play Store, or something Supercell did. They’re blaming it on the Google Play, and suggest users clear the Store cache or data to resolve it. Above are basic instructions, but below are screenshots to help those experiencing issues. Instructions To fix the Clash of Clans update “your device is not compatible with this version” error message, try clearing the Google Play Store cache, and then data. Next, restart the Google Play Store and accept the update again. Pull down the notification bar on your Android device and hit the gear-shaped settings icon, or find “settings” in the application tray. From here navigate to Apps, or App Manager. Next scroll down and find Google Play Store. Select this, and tap “Clear Cache or Data” as shown below. Advertisement This should erase everything, and get rid of any corrupt files that seem to be causing this problem. Supercell claims this will fix the error. Multiple comments suggest it worked. Now go back and download the update. Other Options However, if this doesn’t solve the problem another option is to uninstall Clash of Clans and re-install it. Yes, that sounds scary, and no one wants to lose their entire village by uninstalling the game. You won’t. Obviously proceed at your own risk and use caution. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone If the game is backed up to Google+ or Google Games (an option in settings) your progress is saved. Meaning you can uninstall Clash, reinstall it, and restore your progress simply by going into settings and connecting to Google+, and it will restore your village in less than 10 seconds. However, if you never linked the two, this won’t work. So do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it’s backed up. The guide above goes over a few details regarding transferring the game to a new phone, which is also how you can save progress. That said, if you can’t open the game you can’t link it to Google Games. Do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it is saved. Conclusion This is a big problem. Supercell states that clearing the Google Play Store cache is your only option, and it should solve any issues. They’re currently looking into other options, and will offer up additional information if available. At the end of the day, did clearing the cache or data fix it for you? Let us know in the comments below. Those who fixed it using other methods, feel free to share it below. The December update was loaded with content and a Christmas theme. Expect a bug fixing update in 2017 along with removal of the winter theme. 238 Responses 01/26/2016 kim Reply No, it did not work for me. It is asking me to redeem and then asking for a code. 01/27/2016 Tyr Reply Heya! It didn’t work out for me at first until I cleared out my Google Play Services as well. Hope it helps! 01/28/2016 JUCARIBU Reply THAT WORK FOR ME THANKS 01/31/2016 Albertman Reply My clash restored and updated after i deleted the cache and data from google play store and play store services 02/02/2016 C. Sims Reply Listen to the man or woman lol… Delete all data in “Google Play Store” & “Google Play Services” from your phones settings… this guaranteed to work (then go back to Google play store, accept terms. Then update the app)… from what I know it works with newer phones, if not you could be out of luck. 04/19/2016 ScottManJo Reply Finally got all my favorite Supercell games loaded onto my Galaxy Tab E Lite. Be sure to clear out the Cache & Date from the following 3 apps: Google Play Services, Google Play Store AND Google Play Games. I was able to get CoC & Boom Beach by clearing the first 2 but only could get Clash Royale after clearing Google Play Games. Hope this helps! Good luck & god speed! 05/02/2016 Jeremy Reply ^^ had to do all 3 for mine to work also! Thanks. 07/17/2016 Michael Reply OMG DUDE THANKS!! I got the same device and got super nervous when I couldnt get clash of clans! Your a lifesaver! 10/26/2016 Arjun Reply Now This worked for me.. erazin all 3 of those.. 05/27/2016 Uhoh Reply Worked for me too. Thanks! 02/06/2016 Laryssa Reply I have the g4 it didn’t work for me. Won’t even come up when I search it. Neither does boom beach so I am guessing it has something to do with supercell. Very frustrating because I have been playing for over a year 04/24/2016 Emily Reply Same here, very frustrated and I can’t back it up as to is so I can’t uninstall and reinstall even if I could. 02/20/2016 Shaun Reply i am having this issue with needing a redeem code to even get on the play store now! 02/29/2016 Moaz Reply Thank you very much, it worked immedietly after i did these easy steps, am really grateful :-) thx again 03/20/2016 Logan Reply Didn’t work for me.

I have nothing to clear out. I don’t understand. 07/03/2016 wardojr Reply try updating play store service… 01/26/2016 sol goslin Reply No it diddnt work. I had hopes it would but no such luck. This sucks. I cant even get to the supercell customer service/help line. There may be other issues with this though. Im also noticing a significant drop in the speed of my device, so it may be something that either supercell got in its system, or someone hacked google and delivered a little viral surprise. If thats the case Im sure it will make itself known in a bigger than life fashion. Hopefully that isnt the case. Keep posting updates on what happens. A LOT of people are locked out of the game through this. 07/22/2016 Clara Icasiano Reply just uninstall in play games then install it again. Hope it works :) \ 01/26/2016 Tom Reply no…. 01/26/2016 Steve Reply Hi. I’m on an amazon fire tablet which doesnt support google+ so my game isn’t backed up.

Try giving that a shot 01/26/2016 Mike Reply Didn’t work on my LG G4, I tried u installing and reinstalling… Still not compatible. 01/27/2016 Tyr Reply I use LG as well.

This isn’t the first time and they always say the same fixes and is not working. He brought a new phone and 3_4 months , the same problem. And with their lack of customer service good luck on their emails telling you to contact them in the game. If not fixed soon I will retire my three accounts and so will my friend with four, and its sad seeing that we both spent over $150 on accounts each. 01/28/2016 Nathalie Blues Reply I have spent over $1300 and lead a clan where my friends have spent the same. This is not acceptable SuperCell. Get with the freaking program and fix this. Fix it now ! 01/26/2016 dan Reply Did not work for me either. Th 9 and 3 years of playing gone.

What worked was clearing cache per the suggestion, but when doing the update go to my apps and bulk update all apps that need an update. If I went directly to COC under my apps I still got a message stating it wasn’t compatible. 01/26/2016 Dave Reply I deleted the game and now its completely gone from the google play store, same for boom beach 01/26/2016 Bethany Reply Nope didnt work 01/26/2016 Ryan Reply After just clearing the cache my problem was fixed . hope that helps everyone else 01/26/2016 LEI Reply Me too..tried to uninstall coc but unforunately when i try to download it again, cannot find coc in play store… Help pls… 01/26/2016 Anthony Williams Reply Didn’t work for my kindle fire. 01/26/2016 Bob the clasher Reply Figured it out!!

I cleared the cache in the store and game. That didn’t work. I uninstalled CoC. It didn’t show up in the Play Store. I went to Google Play Games app and was able to install from there.

Your device is listed as not compatible so it will not show up. Also, if you find a copy of the new update By searching coc apk file on Google, it will install by side loading also. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply Here is a link to the latest download for sideloading. http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/supercell/clash-of-clans/clash-clans-8-116-2-android-apk-download/ 01/27/2016 Shawn Reply S5 being playing for a year now suddenly cant play, this is unacceptable, why was the upgrade not tested, when will you resolve it?! 01/27/2016 Umang Reply For everyone who’s facing this problem..go to Google play store through your browser, log in and install the game.

Read comment here and have tried clear cache, data and uninstall update for play store, play game, and play service. Still no luck. Not even show up in play store. 3. Post my comment here and back try again. It just suddenly show up. Install it and play.. No lag no issue. Around 1 hours of time for me to make that god damn stupid install button appear in my play store for doc game! Stupid conclusion from me after tried to install it. Someone say clear 3 time and bulk update. So, MAYBE after we have clear that, it will automatic download the update for playstore and it need sometime for that and without any notification on it. Give it some time after clear cache and data than try again. Hope that’s help. 01/27/2016 Sean Reply Motorola moto 3. Cleared cacache. Nope. Cleared data. Nope.

I decided to uninstall the game and check the store, where it still said my device (LG phone) wasn’t compatible. Vexing to say the least.

Internet How Does Google Maps Work? Rob Nightingale January 8, 2017 08-01-2017 8 minutes How Does Google Maps Work? Facebook Twitter Pinterest MobileAppPage Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Ads by Google Google Maps has been a staple of the internet for over a decade now, but few actually know how it works. For the rest of us, Google Maps is pretty much one step away from magic. For example, how does Google create such accurate maps for so many different regions? How can it collect so much data about so much of the world? Who works to keep the maps maintained and updated? And what about real-time traffic conditions, temporary speed limits, and operating hours for nearby businesses? Somehow all of these complex features work damn well, which is why so many of us have come to rely on Google Maps for everyday navigation 13 Google Maps Tips for Smarter Navigation on Your iPhone 13 Google Maps Tips for Smarter Navigation on Your iPhone Google Maps is a "communication tool" now. Let's look into the benefits – some new, and some old – which can help us make sense of the world around us. Read More . So isn’t it about time we learned how it all works? Keep reading to see the magic behind the curtain. Why Did Google Launch Maps? Google’s public mission is to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”. Many, but not all, of the company’s present-day projects focus on this mission — a mission reliant on gathering, organizing, and interpreting millions of gigabytes of data. But the information Google is trying to organize isn’t only online. Much of it’s offline. Speaking with The Atlantic, Manik Gupta, senior product manager of Google Maps, explained: “Increasingly as we go about our lives, we are trying to bridge that gap between what we see in the real world and [the online world], and Maps really plays that part.” Ads by Google At a very basic level, Google Maps has taken a huge amount of offline information and published it online. We’re talking things like highway networks, road signs, street names, and business names. But as I hint below, Google hopes that Maps will be able to do a lot more in the future. Collecting Data for Google Maps When it comes to collecting data to help maintain and improve Google Maps, it seems there can never be enough — and the impressive bit is that none of that information is over three years old. This is a project of immense scale. Map Partners To help with this endeavor, Google partners with “the most comprehensive and authoritative data sources” via its Base Map Partner Program. A huge number of agencies submit detailed vector data to Google, and these agencies include the USDA Forest Service, the US National Park Service, the US Geological Survey, various city and county councils, and so on. This data is used to demarcate changing boundaries and waterways, display new bike paths, among other things, and this helps to keep the “base map” as up-to-date as possible. Street View Google Street View is a never-ending road trip. With a massive squad of vehicles dispersed around the planet, their aim is to repeatedly drive around every accessible road they can find — all the while taking 360-degree photos everywhere they go. Based on the GPS coordinates of those vehicles, Google overlays its Street View images on top of its base map. Street View offers much more than just a stitched panorama of streets and destinations. Using ever-improving optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities, Google can “read” things like road signs, traffic signs, and business names. These additional reads are processed and turned into navigational and directional data that Maps can incorporate into its database. If a road’s name has changed since the last time it was photographed, a more recent Street View photo will detect this. This is also (partly) how Google has built its huge database of local business details. Satellites Another layer of Google Maps is its satellite view. This is a close collaboration with Google Earth, stitching together high-resolution photographs of the planet taken by satellites above. These images are cross-checked with other layers of data, such as Street View as well as data submitted by external agencies. This helps Maps to pick up geological changes, new and altered buildings, etc. Location Services There isn’t much information available about how exactly Google uses mobile location services to keep Maps up-to-date, but it clearly plays a large role. Yes, that’s right: if Google has access to the location data collected by your smartphone, then you’re part of Google’s crowdsourced operation to improve and expand Maps. Your location data can be used for things like real-time traffic updates, estimating current traffic speeds, and pinpointing road diversions. If a busy route suddenly has no traffic, Maps can assume there’s a diversion and will adjust directions accordingly. Google also uses this data to estimate the hours when individual businesses will be busy. It does this by keeping tabs on the foot traffic in individual buildings. A bit creepy perhaps, but it’s yet another attempt to bring that offline information online. Google Maps Users Google Map Maker is another way in which Google is crowdsourcing its Maps operation, and this is a program that’s been around since 2008 (among Google’s many others). Working in much the same way as OpenStreetMap, Google Map Maker allows anyone to contribute their local knowledge to Google Maps. The good news is that most of this functionality is being incorporated into Maps itself, and Map Maker will be shut down for good in 2017 once the transition is complete. In short, users can edit Google’s maps with their own personal contributions. You’re able to add and edit places, new roads, building outlines, and hiking trails. And if you think you can get away with vandalism, think again: user edits can be reviewed by other users. This means that there’s a huge army of public editors who keep Google Maps up to date 24/7. This is especially useful for mapping hard-to-reach places and for gathering knowledge that would otherwise be out of Google’s reach or awareness. Local Guides As well as its army of editors, Google also has millions of so-called Local Guides. Local Guides is a feature that will remind you of Foursquare and is Google’s attempt at collecting a layer of more subjective data to lay over its base map. When you’re in Google Maps, go to My Contributions and you can search for different places in your area. By leaving a review, answering a few questions, and submitting a photo, you can contribute to this additional layer of data. This local knowledge helps Maps to know things like the vibe of a cafe, whether a hotel has parking, or whether a restaurant has vegan options. In return for contributions, users can earn rewards like increased storage on Google Drive. Making Sense of the Data As you can see, the amount of data being collected by Google is astonishing — and we haven’t even touched on some of the other service integrations, such as with Google’s business listings. These layers of data, when processed, are what give us access to all the information found on Google Maps. But what actually goes into making sense of all that data? This largely boils down to the kinds of algorithms that make up the bedrock of Google as a company The Story Of Google: Algorithm and Functionality Updates The Story Of Google: Algorithm and Functionality Updates Google released its very first algorithm update sixteen months after it went live, which was mostly undocumented. Read More . These algorithms, which happen to be extremely complex and secretive, work to clean the data, spot inconsistencies, and link it all together to make it more useful. For example, when Street View scans images for road signs and business names, algorithms may try to make sense of road networks by interpreting those road signs. At the same time, location data may be taken into account when calculating fastest routes from A to B. Although algorithms are always improving, they can only do so much, so all of this data is also combined with a ton of human involvement. If there’s something Google’s algorithms can’t make sense of, a team member will manually look it over and set things straight. Image Credit: Google Often, intersection logic is inputted manually and new roads are “massaged” into place. This is because sometimes the best way to understand what’s seen on the road is to delegate the task to a human. This is without doubt a huge task. That’s why Google has teams around the world dedicated to keeping things up to date in every country in which it operates. When There’s a Mistake on Google Maps Every day, masses of changes are made to Google Maps. Some of these may be the addition of new places and new roads while other changes may involve fixing mistakes. Many of these are fixed by chance by members of the public: editing place descriptions, adding roads, and so on. Yet on top of this, Google has a large team of people working through the thousands of reports that are filed to Google each day. A good chunk of these reports are reviewed and acted on manually. This is done using Atlas, Google’s own map-editing program. New routes are drawn by hand, roads are connected, new buildings mapped out, etc. This is a project that will never end. With thousands of new roads being built each day and cities changing traffic rules when necessary, Google Maps will always be fighting a battle to stay accurate. Google Maps: A Huge Undertaking While Google Maps is often seen as “just another map,” there are a huge number of layers that we take for granted. These all work together to offer the service that so many have come to rely on — a service that far exceeds the depth or quality of its competitors. From the driving of millions of miles, through the complex algorithms, to the huge amount of human input that’s required, Google Maps is something to be admired.

Google Maps is already going to play an important role in the company’s foray into self-driving cars How Close Are We to Self-Driving Cars Being Available? How Close Are We to Self-Driving Cars Being Available? Read More . And as more subjective information, photos, and videos are linked to Maps, the app could go from being a map of the world to being a guide to the world. Did you know this much work went into maintaining Google Maps? And what other information do you wish you could make use of in Google Maps? If you don’t use Google Maps, why not?

This article basically tells me that Google maps mysteriously gets its map data from an equally mysterious company. "The maps are highly accurate and have been hailed for recording extremely rural areas and mapping the terrain correctly." What makes them so accurate and how do they record extremely rural areas? It seems impossible; I want to know more! Reply yugan February 23, 2010 at 7:23 pm I agree with Hitesh. the title is totally misleading. you haven't explained how Google Maps works. Please change the title. You might get a high page rank..but ppl will be pissed Reply Hitesh February 23, 2010 at 1:48 am You said technology explained but this looks like feature explained. I love you technology section but this post does't much help to understood technology Reply Victor February 22, 2010 at 4:08 pm Tele Atlas is not the only map data provider for Google. Google uses over a dozen diff map data sources. In the US, Google is no longer using Tele Atlas. Reply Dean Sherwin February 23, 2010 at 1:56 am Hi Victor, I did some research into your comment but can't find anything to confirm it. Google say themselves that they use Tele Atlas as their primary mapping source. Have you got any link etc...? - Dean. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The system uses the same speaker system as Google Home, a Google Assistant tool that can answer questions in real time, turn on and off smart appliances, and activate streaming music services. Hyundai’s Blue Link system already allows access to features like remote locking, remote start with climate control, stolen vehicle recovery, and Google Destination Search, either from within the car, or via a connected smartphone. Now with Google Assistant added to the system, Hyundai owners can give voice commands as quickly and easy as “Okay Google, ask Blue Link to lock my car” or “Okay Google, tell Blue Link to send the address of the Las Vegas Convention Centre to my Sante Fe” as well as asking Google to search for nearby restaurants, or asking about the weather before remotely starting, and pre-conditioning the vehicle. For security reasons, users will be asked to enter their Blue Link account PIN before Google Assistant can carry out locking or starting functions to prevent unauthorized access to the vehicle. “Our customers are finding smart home integrations like the one we are showcasing with Google Home to be very useful and convenient,” Hyundai America’s director of digital business and connected operations, Manish Mehrotra, said. “We will continue to add layers of convenience to the Blue Link connected car system and our cars, making features like remote EV charge management, remote locking, temperature and remote start easier than ever while sitting on the couch and saying ‘Ok Google’". Unfortunately for local buyers the Blue Link system isn’t yet offered in Hyundai’s vehicle range in Australia, meaning that for the time being remote access features and Google Assistant compatibility aren’t available to Australian consumers.

But there was much more said in his freewheeling conversation with Vikas Singh and Kim Arora. Read on for insights on everything from demonetisation to AI | TNN | Updated: Jan 8, 2017, 10.51 AM IST Highlights Short of traffic, most things seem to be getting better in India, Pichai said India looks very entrepreneurial. People are very creative and determined: Pichai On Jan 5, TOI front-paged an interaction with Sundar Pichai. But there was much more said in his freewheeling conversation with Vikas Singh and Kim Arora . Read on for insights on everything from demonetisation to AI When you come to India, what excites or frustrates you the most? Each time, I see the progress in India in many small ways. The first time I took a plane was when I left for the US. Yesterday, I had a chance to meet some of the CEOs of the largest Indian airlines...there are close to 100 million people who fly in India now. The trends are all in the right direction. I met with some old friends in Bengaluru...they are starting and running schools. The ideas I heard are no different from what some of the best schools in the US are thinking about. India looks very entrepreneurial. People are very creative and determined. Short of traffic, most things seem to be getting better (laughs). Internet traffic too? That is getting better too. The carriers are doing a great job bringing more connectivity. Smartphone adoption is well under way. We'd like to see it grow even faster. We need to push the price point for entry-level smartphones further down...a $30 price point, I think, for it to truly reach the next level. And we would like to help play a role with Android. Any New Year resolutions? Every year we write what we call OKRs, our Objectives and Key Results for the year. I will share it with the entire company when I go back by second or third week of January. I have a long plane ride back in which to finalise my objectives. Can you give us a heads up on what you might be writing? (laughs) Well, we're hiring at Google. You can join, and you'd get to know them as well. But 2016 was a big year for us. We made a big bet on machine learning and AI (artificial intelligence) and how we can use it to make our services better. We think of this as an important point of inflexion. This year we brought out products like the Google Assistant and Google Home. Pixel also has the assistant built in. I view that as a foundation for how we think about things for the next many years. A lot of our goals will be about increasing our focus on AI and bringing it to our users. How far away are we from Terminator and Rise of the Machines? I don't think about it that way. The scenarios I am excited by are bringing AI to assist humans to do many things better. It's odd for me to think of this as a mutually competitive thing. I don't think that's how technology has been put to use historically. Google tried its hand at social networks with Wave, Buzz, Orkut, Google+. These couldn't scale or sustain. What has Google learnt from that? We want to always work on ambitious things and by definition, we won't succeed in everything we do. It's impossible to be very ambitious and not fail. When we write our company objectives, if we meet 70% of our objectives, we consider that as a success. If we meet 100% of our objectives, we always think we didn't write them ambitiously enough. I think that's fine. To me, what's much more important is, are we continuing to innovate? Are we at the forefront of applying computer science to solve problems for our users consistent with our mission? I think we do that, and we have to do that every year, and in the future too. Besides AI, Google had earlier talked of working on translation. How close are you to making something where I speak in English and you listen to it in Tamil? It's progressing remarkably fast. But I think it's not going to be just about translation like you just described. You have to improve computing experience — hardware, software, everything so all of that can work in real time. This is what I talked about — a transition from a mobile-first to AI-first world. Intelligent computing must be available for you when you need it so you can interact with it in more natural ways. I'd be disappointed if in five years we are not able to do what you just described. You've said earlier that you almost did not get selected when you applied to Google. What was your first interaction with Google like? I interviewed with Google on April 1 of 2004. They had launched Gmail, and it was invite-only. But Google also did an April Fools' joke, and I wasn't even sure if it had launched. So people were all asking me about Gmail and what I thought of it. But they hadn't exactly given it to everyone. So, it was quirky, and I realised that they took things lightly, but deep down, they were serious about the work they were doing. That was my first impression of Google. What was your first meeting with co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin like? I do recall a meeting in which we were speaking. And from under the table, out came Larry. I didn't know Larry was there. Our projector system wasn't working ...Larry was down there trying to fix it. How often do you meet them? I see them every week. My exchanges with them are always a big part of how I think about what to do. I value that a lot. Why is an India tailoring of a product limited to launching a less data-hungry version of a regular product? As we invest more in India and add more people, you will see products that are more substantial. In what way? Could be new products, or whatever. Right now we come to India and see what users need most, and we address those things first. And we find, if you fix it here and learn it, it applies elsewhere as well. Maps Offline — I have used it in the US. Because I could be hiking or something and wouldn't have connectivity. But Google station and the whole work we are doing around that... it's something we are going to make available everywhere else. A lot of how Google Maps works today happened from India first. Going by sheer scale, India is going to be an important market for technology over time. Do you think we sometimes over-determine the role of technology in solving business or social problems? Yes. Take education for example. You would go horribly wrong with education if you just think bringing technology can improve it. You have to involve teachers, administrators — technology can only be part of the solution. But it is also true that when you bring technology into people's lives, it has a profound impact. We do a lot of non-profit work as a part of Google.org and we work with non-profit organisations in education and healthcare. Right now, a lot of people are being forced to embrace technology because of demonetisation. What's your take? I view digitising payments as a big courageous move. These things can have tremendous multiplicative effects. India has a chance to leapfrog some of the things other countries have struggled with. We're doing it with cellphones instead of landlines, and I hope instead of car ownership, we find a better way to manage that resource. Similarly in payments, the UPI stack in India is phenomenal. Something like that doesn't exist in most countries. There is a lot more infrastructure here than people realise. The foundations have been set for digitising India on the payment side as well. I am not an expert on this, I have only spent a small amount of time on it. But I think it is a courageous move and from our perspective anything we can do to help, we would be glad to do so.

Well you’re in luck, listed below are 2 tablets worth $120 and below! I’m an Android Fan so for all you Apple Fan’s I’m not hating but I haven’t found any iPads for under $120 unless they’re used and scratched up. Now the main thing about Android tablets you really need to be careful, Not all tablets come with the Google Play Store, The manufacturer needs to be Google Certified for that model in order to use the Google Play Store. You can find plenty of tablets under 100 bucks but be wary because they won’t mention that it can’t handle all the apps that your use to using and that you have to get it from there app store. Sure it’s nice to get a tablet for under 100 that’s Android 4.0 ICE CREAM SANDWICH but if it crashes all the time when your in the middle of playing Ninja Fruit or Angry Birds is it really worth it? I’m not sure about everyone else but when i buy a tablet either it be an Android or an iPad I expect to get apps that work not crash all the time. When it come’s to the best tablet for the money, I’ll start off with AGPTEK, Why AGPTEK? Well first of all I own 3 of them for my kids so I already know they work, Also AGPTEK does come with GOOGLE PLAY STORE. It has a simple and fashion design for high quality life, 5 point capacitive touch screen for easy operation, 7 inch TFT display for beautiful pictures,Build-in GPU (2D/3D graphic processor unit),support 3D game perfectly. It also has been rated between 3-4 STARS by Amazon’s verified customers that have bought this tablet, I always read the comments from customers before i buy a product online. Of course you will see a few negatives but you will also see negatives on high end products as well.The price tag? $95 The next best tablet I would recommend is a little bit more pricey but you get double the RAM speed (1 Gig) which always helps out on performance of the tablet. The COBY MID7065-8, Now when you try and look at different Coby models make sure you look at all the features because a few of them don’t come with the GOOGLE PLAY STORE, But the model I will be talking about does. Remember tablets need to be Goolge Certified in order to put the Play Store on there product. This model features: Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, 7.0 inches Display, High-speed 1.2 GHz dual-core processor, 8 GB Flash Memory, 1 GB RAM Memory.

Baig , USA TODAY , KHOU 9:18 PM. CST January 07, 2017 Alexa is featured at the Whirlpool booth. (Photo: Edward C. Baig) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST LAS VEGAS—Bark out “Alexa” in the congested halls of CES, and you would have heard a chorus of devices, from cars to smartphones to household appliances, answer back. OK, so not literally, but Alexa is assuming an increasing role across numerous products, a sure sign Amazon is leaning on its vocal digital assistant to spread its artificial intelligence system everywhere, and certainly go well beyond the popular Echo speaker where Alexa got its start. Rival Google Assistant wasn’t as prominent at this CES, though hot chipmaker Nvidia aims to expand the artificial intelligence-powered assistant's reach throughout the home. Also, Google announced integrations with Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai, and Rishi Chandra, the vice-president for Google Home, gave a talk on smarter homes. Microsoft’s Cortana and Apple’s Siri had a much lower profile at CES as well, but none of these Amazon rivals should be underestimated in the voice-driven AI space, which is still in its relative infancy. For its part, Amazon announced more than 35 new partners this week, some that embed cloud-based Alexa smarts directly into their own products, and are completely independent of Amazon’s own Echo, Echo Dot, or Fire TV with Alexa. And some that still require Echo’s and Echo Dots, adding to the more than 7,000 “skills” that Alexa is capable of. Around the massive trade show you found Alexa as the voice behind the humanoid Lynx robot that UBTECH Robotics has just introduced. And Alexa is a new voice inside Ford’s Sync3 infotainment system. The Mate 9 phablet from China’s Huawei that came out in the U.S. Friday becomes the first smartphone in the world to have Alexa preinstalled, pitting it against Siri in the iPhone, and the Google Assistant in Android devices. Another Chinese company, Lenovo, is bringing out the Lenovo Smart Assistant, essentially Lenovo’s own version of an independent Echo-like speaker. It will cost $129.99 when it arrives in May, or $50 more for a model with premium Harman Kardon audio. Alexa Voice Services will also be embedded into the yet-to-be priced LG Smart InstaView refrigerator. You might say “Alexa, we need ice” and the fridge will turn on the ice maker. Or you might use your voice to have Alexa search recipes or play music—InstaView is a Bluetooth speaker too. Needless to say, Amazon will presumably be all too pleased to have you restock the LG fridge by ordering groceries right there via Alexa and Amazon Prime. Amazon, of course, is encouraging all these partnerships. “We‘ll never be able to build all the potential devices out there between smart home and wearables, and automobiles,” Amazon Alexa vice president Steve Rabuchin told me during an interview. “We can’t do it alone. We look to the developer community to innovate on our behalf and innovate using Alexa.” Whirlpool is among the companies adding skills that require Echo or and other Alexa-enabled Amazon products. So you’ll be able to say to an Echo, “Alexa, ask Whirlpool to put the drier into wrinkle shield” or “Alexa, preheat the oven to 350.” You can similarly control Samsung’s new POWERbot VR7000 robot vacuum by voice through an Echo. And starting this month, ADT customers will be able to arm and disarm their security via their voice and Echo products: “Alexa, Tell ADT to disarm my security alarm, using PIN 3095.” Of course, some products are compatible with more than one assistant: Belkin says its $34.99 Wemo Mini home automation smart plug works with Amazon Echo and Google Home devices, for instance. And even before all these companies descended upon Las Vegas for CES, the Wynn hotel announced its intention to supply Echo speakers in every room. All this activity is good news for Amazon, but whether Alexa-everywhere is also good stuff for consumers will vary. I'm a fan of Echo but it remains to be seen how well each partner exploits the Alexa relationship. Google is further along, for instance, in letting you have a "conversation" with a digital assistant. And by no means count out Apple or Microsoft. Consumers must also be mindful of privacy, what with all those devices listening and capturing what you have to say. Still, anyone who has spent a lot of time with Alexa generally likes the exchange. “I think it’s going to help Amazon and I think it’s going to help the industry because (Alexa) is already an accepted format,” says Tom Campbell, chief technologist and corporate director for Video & Audio Center, a Los Angeles area-based retail chain. “So the more you can broaden that format into your car, into other devices, you’re comfortable with it because you already know and you use it and you trust it.” Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Woman killed in car crash, 6 injured Fatal accident shuts down Southwest Fwy at Westpark Texans' season ends with loss to Patriots 34-16 Teacher gets 10 years for sleeping with student Houston forecast for Sunday Truck catches fire at gas pump in Fort Bend Co.

Several smartphone manufacturers, including Asus and ZTE, announced at CES 2017, intentions to implement the Daydream VR protocol onto its devices. Google also announced, alongside Huawei CEO Richard Yu at the CES 2017 keynote, that the Chinese manufacturer will release its own take on its Daydream View VR headset. The accessory will be called Huawei View and is be compatible with the Huawei Mate 9 Pro and the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche design. Huawei View is the first third-party iteration of the Daydream View headset. Showcased at CES 2017, the headset bears a striking resemblance to the Samsung Gear VR headsets. There are currently no price or availability details for the headset. However, Huawei also announced at CES 2017, U.S. availability of the Mate 9 smartphone, which means the Huawei View should also be coming to the U.S. The Mate 9 is Huawei’s first flagship smartphone to launch in the U.S. In addition to Daydream compatibility for the Huawei Mate 9 Pro and Mate 9 Porsche design, the new Asus ZenFone AR will launch Daydream ready. The ZTE Axon 7 will also be Daydream ready upon updating to Android 7.0 Nougat.

(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) Every major global automakers along with a number of technology companies share a similar goal: Be among the leaders of the self-driving car revolution. But the path that each automaker is taking is often very different. Some automakers are developing self-driving software in-house while others are leaning more on partners. Others are investing in start-ups or leaning on partnerships with global technology companies. Meanwhile, some technology companies that started with aspirations of becoming automotive manufacturers are rethinking that mission, opting instead to partner with automakers and provide services, sensors or both. "There are some serious differences abut there are a lot of similarities, too," said Glenn Stevens, vice president of automotive mobility initiatives for MICHauto and the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce. "I don’t think you can always tell who is ahead. You can see where the investments are being made, but they are all pursuing different strategies." Automakers and technology companies tend to be secretive about their progress. That makes it hard for analysts to figure out who is really ahead and who is just thumping their chest loudly. Read more: DETROIT FREE PRESS Why we aren't ready for self-driving cars - yet DETROIT FREE PRESS New mobility is challenging automakers' assumptions "That makes it hard to say who is really in the lead," said Karl Brauer, senior director of Cox Automotive. "I have a sense of who is pushing really hard, and who is trying the hardest...because like most technology endeavors, you don’t want to tell everyone where you are." Companies that emerge as leaders will be those that work well with partners whose cultures are different from their own, predicts Chris Thomas, a founder and partner in Fontinalis, a Detroit-based venture capital firm. "Autonomous vehicle technology is a new and different technology unto itself," Thomas said. "And then, that new technology must work with other new technology," such as cyber-security technology, artificial intelligence software and the car's electrical infrastructure. "Anyone who tells themselves they are going to do this themselves, they are leaving a lot of opportunity and talent on the table." Suppliers including Bosch, Delphi, Magna, Nvidia, Intel and ZF Group also have embraced self-driving cars and are providing both hardware and software necessary for self-driving vehicles. Here is quick look at the different paths that automakers and major tech companies are pursuing: Apple's 'Project Titan' Apple is among the most secretive and, for years, was viewed as the company that might be able to figure out the entire self-driving car landscape on its own. But this past summer the company reduced staffing for what had been called Project Titan. Read more: DETROIT FREE PRESS Why you should care about this 'new mobility'? DETROIT FREE PRESS Auto show to spotlight mobility tech Little is known about Apple’s progress and plans. Apple has never acknowledged that it is working on a car.  In September Apple laid off dozens of employees previously assigned to Project Titan. Apple may still be working development of an autonomous driving system, but it's not interested in manufacturing anything that could be called a car. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Ford CEO Mark Fields shows off the new Velodyne Puck sensor at a press conference on CES Press Day, January 5, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The new Velodyne models will be fitted into the side view mirrors of Ford's Fusion Hybrid self-driving cars.  (Photo: ROBYN BECK, AFP/Getty Images) Ford's city services strategy Ford CEO Mark Fields says the Dearborn automaker can make money providing transportation services to cities. "The cities have this issue of congestion. It's not only a quality-of-life issue, it's an economic issue," Fields said. "Because if you can’t get around, you have businesses that can’t deliver goods and people who can't get to where they want to go." Fields said he believes that Ford can make money if it gets involved in shuttle services, bike-sharing services and other forms of mobility. "We already have some services businesses where the margins are much healthier," than the traditional automotive industry, Fields said. Another strategy that makes Ford different from some automakers is its commitment to leap over semi-autonomous vehicles and go directly to selling a fully-autonomous vehicle by 2021. "They don’t plan on selling any cars to consumers that are not fully capable of full self-driving 100% of the time," Brauer said. Exterior designer Matt Dunford speaks beside the unveiled Fiat Chrysler Portal Concept car during the Fiat Chrysler press conference at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on January 3, 2017.  (Photo: FREDERIC J. BROWN, AFP/Getty Images) Fiat Chrysler Automobiles working with Google's Waymo  The Auburn Hills automaker has been the quietest of the Detroit Three when it comes to self-driving cars but made a big move in May when it announced an agreement to provide 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to Google's self-driving project, which is now called Waymo. FCA developed those minivans and delivered them in December. Waymo plans to showcase one of those minivans at the Detroit auto show on Sunday. FCA also unveiled a self-driving concept vehicle called Chrysler Portal at CES on Tuesday that the automaker says illustrates what family transportation could evolve into in the near future. The automaker worked with Samsung Electronics as its provider of 360-degree cameras and other sensors and Panasonic Automotive as its supplier for infotainment, wireless connectivity and audio systems. Read more: DETROIT FREE PRESS Self-driving fleets to give consumers more options DETROIT FREE PRESS The days of self-driving cars are closer than you think FCA's partnerships with Waymo, Panasonic and Samsung are an indication that the automaker sees deep partnerships with large tech companies as a way it can keep up with automakers that have larger research and development budgets for self-driving vehicles. General Motors Chairman and CEO Mary Barra speaks next to a autonomous Chevrolet Bolt electric car Thursday, Dec. 15, 2016, in Detroit. General Motors has started testing fully autonomous vehicles on public roads around its technical center in suburban Detroit.  (Photo: Paul Sancya, AP) General Motors bets big with Bolt, Cruise Automation, Lyft and Maven and acquisitions GM said last month it will begin producing and testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolts in Michigan immediately. GM CEO Mary Barra said in December it plans to immediately begin testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt electric on public roads in Michigan and is buidling a fleet of autonomous Bolts at its Orion Assembly Plant. "We expect to be the first high-volume auto manufacturer to build fully autonomous vehicles in a mass-production assembly plant," Barra said in a blog post on LinkedIn. GM also spent big bucks in 2016 to dramatically accelerate its development of self-driving vehicles when it spent $500 million for 9% of ride-sharing company Lyft, and $581 million for San Francisco autonomous vehicle software developer Cruise Automation. A Nissan Leaf is displayed at CES 2017 at the Las Vegas Convention Center on January 5, 2017 in Las Vegas, Nevada. To accelerate the time it will take for autonomous vehicles to get on the road safely, Carlos Ghosn announced a breakthrough technology called "Seamless Autonomous Mobility," or SAM. Developed from NASA technology, SAM partners in-vehicle artificial intelligence (AI) with human support to help autonomous vehicles make decisions in unpredictable situations and build the knowledge of in-vehicle AI. This technology could potentially enable millions of driverless cars to co-exist with human drivers in an accelerated timeline. It is part of Nissan Intelligent Integration.  (Photo: David Becker, Getty Images) Toyota Research Institute connects three leading universities. The Toyota Research Institute is a network of robotics experts who teach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford and the University of Michigan. Together these experts and some of Toyota's own people are working on solutions for difficult driving scenarios (snow, ice and heavy rain), and building artificial intelligence systems that learn from, and evolve to predict, such scenarios. TRI also will apply AI to the challenge of home robotics. Focusing on needs of our aging society and the remarkable progress in electronics and computer science, Toyota seeks to develop machines, including home robots may become even more personally prized in our future than cars have been in our past. Toyota also has made an unspecified investment in Uber. But the Japanese automaker has taken a cautious approach to bringing fully autonomous cars to public roads. This past week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, TRI CEO Gill Pratt said the company is “nowhere near close” to a level of full autonomous driving, labeled as Level 5 by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Pratt's comments Thursday came as Toyota unveiled the Concept-i car at CES. “Historically human beings have shown zero tolerance for injury or death caused by flaws in a machine,” Pratt said. Nissan, Carlos Ghosn Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said last week the Japanese automaker plans to launch a new “Seamless Autonomous Mobility,” or “SAM,” system that combines artificial intelligence with human support to help self-driving vehicles make decisions in difficult situations. Ghosn, in contrast to Ford, believes automakers should phase in self-driving vehicles. "Even fully autonomous vehicles will not be able to handle every possible situation they encounter. The world is too simply too complex," Ghosn said. Nissan and Renault plan to launch at least 10 vehicles with "significant autonomous drive functionality" by 2020. Tesla Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk is letting 1,000 customers try out the latest version of the brand's Autopilot system, another step forward on the way to fully self-driving cars. The new system being activated on the limited basis is dubbed Autopilot HW2, or Hardware 2, a reference to the Tesla electric vehicles built after October that are loaded with advanced radar, cameras and ultrasonic sensors. The limited distribution of the Autopilot software upgrade is meant to ensure that any glitches are debugged before a broader rollout. After initiating the Version 8.1 software update over the Dec. 31-Jan. 1 weekend, Musk tweeted that Tesla would then "hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week." Tesla was in the spotlight throughout 2016 because of a handful of crashes both in the U.S. and abroad that may have been related to either improper use or compromised operation of Autopilot software. The most publicized incident occurred last May, when an Ohio man, Joshua Brown, died after his Model S sedan plowed into a truck crossing its path. The Autopilot system didn't see the truck's white side as an object and failed to apply the brakes. Federal regulators are investigating. Tesla aims to begin producing its entry-level electric sedan, the $35,000 and up Model 3, later this year. Musk has pinned high hopes on Model 3, specifically a brisk production target that will see Tesla's total vehicle output jump from 50,000 to 500,000 units a year. Uber hopes to replace employees For Uber, a self-driving car would eliminate the cost of paying drivers to take customers to their destination. Drivers are the most expensive part of its business model. That's why the ride-hailing pioneer, which built its company on providing quick transportation through a mobile phone application, has begun testing a self-driving car in Pittsburgh, home of the company's Advanced Technologies Center. The car, a Ford Fusion Hybrid with a roof-full of radar, lasers and cameras, will be collecting road-mapping data as well as testing its real-world traffic reactions. Volkswagen Group Last April, an Audi SQ5 outfitted with Delphi technology drove itself 3,000 miles across the U.S., doing 99% of the driving by itself. In January 2016, Delphi showed off a new autonomous driving concept at CES. Waymo and FCA announced that production of 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans uniquely built to enable fully self-driving operations has been completed. The vehicles are currently being outfitted with Waymo's fully self-driving technology, including a purpose-built computer and a suite of sensors, telematics and other systems.  (Photo: FCA US) Volvo For Volvo, autonomous vehicles are about both cars and trucks. Volvo, which also makes trucks of all sizes, is exploring self-driving vehicles that are able to navigate construction sites, mines, quarries and public roads. In Sweden, Volvo is testing self-driving cars on public Swedish roads, and by 2017, real-world customers will be using 100 self-driving Volvos. The test program is a partnership between Volvo, the Swedish Transport Administration, the Swedish Transport Agency, Lindholmen Science Park and the City of Gothenburg, and is endorsed by the Swedish Government. Volkswagen Group Waymo operated for eight years as Google's self-driving project until it renamed itself last month. Waymo initially was developing cars without steering wheels and pedals but realized many customers are unlikely to accept those vehicles and still want the option to drive. Now, Waymo is transforming itself from a research project into business enterprise that must make a profit. It's the mission is to bring the company's technology to market and monetize it via a partnership with an automotive company. "They understand now they can’t go straight there now," to a fully autonomous vehicle without driver controls, Brauer said. "They also are very clearly going to be a provider of services to existing automaker, verses building their own car." Last spring, Google inked a deal with Fiat Chrysler to outfit 100 Pacifica minivans with Google's radar, lasers and cameras. Google had said the deal was made to quickly add to its fleet in order to further test its systems and ready them for commercial use. Waymo CEO John Krafcik will be in Detroit today and plans to unveil the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid. Contact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

With information from previous questions or commands, Assistant can make the conversation feel more natural, but it’s not perfect, especially on certain devices. It looks like the Nvidia Shield will have a leg up on some other Assistant-supported devices, however. The biggest drawback up to this point with Google Assistant is the fact that before you ask it anything, you have to repeat the “OK, Google” voice command (or alternatively “Hey, Google” if you’re using a Google Home). With the newly-announced Nvidia Shield TV, however, you only have to give the command once and then continue the conversation without having to say it again. Check out our walkthrough of the Shield TV’s Google Assistant interface in the video below. As you listen to the demonstration of Assistant, you’ll notice that you can continuously ask it to either refine the previous search or give a command based on the previous search all without saying “OK, Google” between each interaction. Nvidia mentioned to us at CES 2017 that it had to work directly with Google to make this feature work. Along with this ability to not have to repeat yourself, it’s also possible that the Shield TV will be the only Android TV for now to support always-listening since it includes a game controller (which has a long-lasting battery, and won’t get lost) and not just a remote. (Nvidia says it didn’t put a pair of microphones on the hardware itself because sometimes the units are placed away in cabinets or in front of speakers.) When the Shield TV ships out to customers in several weeks, Google Assistant will not yet be live. Hopefully, when it does become activated, this continued listening feature will be incorporated. The representative also didn’t know exactly how long the Assistant would continue to listen for further commands but it appeared to stop after roughly 10 to 15 seconds.

Phones by Jessica Dolcourt January 7, 2017 5:09 PM PST @jdolcourt Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS The Asus ZenFone AR is ahead of the curve Asus's new Daydream ready, Tango compatible phone of the future is a first of its kind and gives us a glimpse of the AR and VR experiences a phone can deliver. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 1:35 Close Drag CES may be lean on phones this year, but the 17 we saw pointed out some trends that will help define handsets through 2017, especially as we head into next month's Mobile World Congress, the phone world's best and biggest show. Biggest trends AI will be big as companies integrate artificial intelligence in new ways that help anticipate your needs. AR and VR (augmented reality and virtual reality) will inch closer to the mainstream as companies integrate Google's Tango and Daydream software into thin, attractive packages. Budget hardware will improve, thanks to last year's tech making it into this year's cheap-but-good devices. 18 Shiny, cheap, 'magic': The phones of CES 2017 Most interesting phones Asus ZenFone AR: The first phone with both Google Tango and Google Daydream has a lot of potential to layer immersive digital experiences onto the real world. Unfortunately, since the demo didn't work, this is all theoretical for now, but something to keep an eye on. Huawei Honor Magic: With its built-in AI, this phone -- which only sells in China right now -- promises to more conveniently surface notifications, offer up a flashlight when it's dark and generally help you out with useful information that comes to you. BlackBerry "Mercury": BlackBerry lives! The brand's rescue by Alcatel parent company TCL means we'll start seeing more BlackBerry phones soon, keyboard and all. We got a sneak peek at the "Mercury" and should see the real deal at Mobile World Congress next month. LG Stylus 3: With the recalled Samsung Galaxy Note 7 out of the picture, this phone is currently the only one you can buy with a stylus. It doesn't have all of the Note 7's premium appeal, but it's a viable option for die-hards. Huawei Mate 9 with Alexa: The Mate 9 is already on sale globally, but it's now in the US, too. Next month it'll be the first phone to get Amazon Alexa, the assistant that ties into smart devices all throughout the home. That makes the Mate 9 basically an Amazon Alexa remote, even if you don't have the Echo. More to come from HTC and MWC 2017's year in phones is just kicking off, with more to come next week. HTC will launch a new product on January 12. The event, called "U", doesn't offer much of a hint of what we should expect, but rumors say there will be two phones called the HTC U Ultra and U Play. A few weeks after that, we have Mobile World Congress (MWC), the world's largest mobile conference. It's there that we see flagship devices, a mountain of accessories and oddball concept devices from companies hoping to gain ground. One big change we expect this year is Samsung's lower-profile presence at the show. Its Galaxy S phone has been the anchor for years, but given the Note 7 recall and uncertainty over what caused the explosion, it's probable that Samsung will hold off its Galaxy S8 launch until it can confirm that its next flagship won't suffer the same fate. CNET will be on the ground covering MWC live from February 26 to March 1. 14 Uplevel your phone with these cases and accessories from CES 2017 Share your voice 0 comments Tags CES 2017 Phones Asus BlackBerry Huawei LG 7 Design 8 Features 9 Performance 8 Camera CNET Review Huawei Mate 9 With a huge, bright screen, all-day battery, good camera and power to spare, the Huawei Mate 9 is a large-screen phone for anyone.

Android with umbrella Android is the most popular mobile operating system on the planet, but it's also the most widely hacked.  Android's security vulnerabilities are due to its open-source licenses, which allow phone manufacturers to adapt and update the system's source code as they see fit. That flexibility was part of the system's appeal for developers, driving its early adoption and success, but it's also led to wide-ranging security vulnerabilities.  Google revealed just after Thanksgiving that over 1.3 million Google accounts were compromised due to an extensive malware campaign security researchers called "Gooligan." Cybersecurity firm Check Point, which first discovered the breach last year, said it affects Android users who downloaded third-party apps from the Android app store.  Check Point estimates that roughly 13,000 new devices are being infected with Gooligan every day. After downloading an app, a user's device immediately becomes infected with malware that allows the hackers to steal authentication tokens that can be used to access data from Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, Google Drive, and more. You can find out if your Android device was targeted in Gooligan for free on Check Point.  But Gooligan isn't the only malware campaign around, and it won't be the last. How do you find out if your Android phone has been hacked Unfortunately, there are few easy ways to tell, and avoiding third-party apps isn't a full-proof way to avoid being hacked. If your Android device has a Qualcomm chipset, it's already vulnerable to hacking. Check Point discovered four security vulnerabilities in the Qualcomm chipset.  You can help protect your phone by only downloading apps from the Google Play store, avoiding apps from third-party sources (i.e. an unauthorized app to play YouTube videos), and constantly downloading security updates. You should also avoid a rooted phone—one that's been modified to allow you to install software the manufacturer typically wouldn't—because they are far more susceptible to being breached. If you do suspect that your Android phone has been hacked, a factory reset may be the only option. But in many cases, it won't work. The only course of action is then is to shut off your Android phone, change all the passwords to your necessary accounts, and get a new device.  Here are some signs that your Android phone may be hacked.   1) Shady apps are running in the background Is your phone going through a lot of data lately? Is your battery life draining quicker than usual? That may be because of the result of spyware. According to Android Authority, spyware apps use a lot of data since they are constantly running in the background.  To check on your Android's data usage, go to Settings, then "Data Usage," and look under the "App Usage" category.  © Provided by Daily Dot 2) Pop-up notifications at every turn Are pop-ups ads for apps appearing out of nowhere? Are you getting strange messages telling you that you've been breached and asking you to download a free anti-virus software? You may have malware already on your phone. 3) Unauthorized purchases on your credit card or posts on Facebook or Twitter Keep an eagle's eye on your bank account and social media for suspicious activity. Even if you don't store your credit card information online, hackers who have access to your personal details can often guess at your password. A transaction that you don't recognize could be the first sign that you've been the victim of an Android hack.  4) Random shutdowns Does your phone suddenly shut down for no reason? Does it restart without you prompting it? This should be a major red flag.  "If you believe that your phone’s software is stable and updated, then random reboots or shut downs can mean your phone has spyware software installed," Joy of Android wrote. "An unstable third-party app might also be causing this." Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

Could this suggest higher-capacity models are in the pipeline?  ( Google ) Advertisement There's currently an on-going promotion on Verizon's listing for Google's self-branded flagships, the Pixel and the Pixel XL. But an interesting tidbit has been dug up recently, alluding to the availability of 256 GB Pixel and Pixel XL models in the pipeline from the Big Red. 256 GB Pixel And Pixel Models From Verizon? Users who clicked the "Learn More" button under Verizon's "Our best phones for as low as $10 [per] month" headline were taken to a table that lists 256 GB Pixel and Pixel XL models for $18.33 per month. However, the said models could have simply been a typographical error, since Verizon has seemingly reused the figures from the iPhone page. Simply put, Verizon probably wasn't able to edit the figures in order to fit the specifications of the Pixel and Pixel XL. Tough luck for those who desire for a Pixel handset with much beefier storage. As further proof, Droid Life was able to speak with a representative from Verizon who suggests that the listing may have just been a plain mistake, since there aren't currently 256 GB Pixel and Pixel XL model in the works, as far as the company is concerned. There goes your chance. Google Pixel And Pixel XL Specs The Pixel and the Pixel XL are Google's first phone after dropping the Nexus branding. Google bills it as the first Google-made phone from its roster, although much of its manufacturing was HTC's handiwork. The job order reportedly could have been Huawei's to fulfill, but it had a falling out with Google after encountering some differences. The two devices, boasting top-tier specs for a top-tier price, hold a minor disparities, predominantly with the display size. The base Pixel comes with a 5-inch AMOLED 1080p display, against the Pixel XL's 5.5-inch AMOLED Quad HD display. The two models' batteries also differ: the Pixel has a 2,770 mAh battery under the hood, while the Pixel XL boasts a significantly higher-capacity one at 3,450 mAh. Both of these batteries feature Quick Charge 3.0 support, and are non-removable. Both models use a 2.15 GHz 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip, partnered with an Adreno 530 GPU for graphics performance. Both handsets have 4 GB of DDR4 RAM and may come in 32 or 128 GB configurations, although there's no means to nudge the memory beyond that since the models don't support expandable storage. On the back is a 12.3-megapixel shooter that's scored the highest of any camera phone by DxOMark's standards. Meanwhile, on the front of both phones is an 8-megapixel camera. The rear shooter can record 4K video, while the front shooter can record 1080p video. The Pixel starts at $649 while the Pixel XL starts at a steep price of $769. Prices go up for 128 GB models, logically. The phones come in a few wackily named colors: Quite Black, Very silver, and Really Blue. Judging by their spec sheet alone, the Pixel handsets are quite excellent Android smartphones, although they're both not without their slew of problems. Is 128 GB not enough for the Pixel and the Pixel XL? Do you wish there was a 256 GB model, as well? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below.

The potential banishment is being sought in a Labor Department lawsuit filed Wednesday with the Office of Administrative Law Judges. The complaint alleges that Google has repeatedly refused to provide the Labor Department with employee compensation records and other information as part of an audit designed to ensure the company isn’t discriminating against workers based on gender or race. The review of how Google pays the thousands of workers at its headquarters in Mountain View, California, is allowed under decades-old laws regulating U.S. government contractors. Google has struck a series of deals with various federal government agencies during the past decade, including a digital advertising agreement cited by the Labor Department that has generated more than $600,000 for the company since June 2014, according to the complaint. That amount is a pittance for Google, whose revenue has surpassed $130 billion during the same span. If Google doesn’t comply with all its demands, the Labor Department wants a legal order that would void all of the company’s current federal government contracts and block future deals. In a statement, Google said it has provided hundreds of thousands of records in an attempt to comply with the Labor Department’s requests, but has rebuffed some of the agency’s demands as “overbroad” and an invasion of employee privacy. Like most other big technology companies, Google for the past few years has been posting breakdowns of its workforce that show most of its computer programmers and other high-paid employees in technical jobs are white and Asian men. The disclosures have become a source of embarrassment for Google and its technology industry peers, who have repeatedly acknowledged they need to do more to hire women, blacks and Hispanics. “We’re very committed to our affirmative action obligations, and to improving the diversity of our workforce, and have been very vocal about the importance of these issues,” Google reiterated in its response to the Labor Department’s lawsuit. But Google, which is part of Alphabet Inc., and other tech companies so far have only been disclosing the types of jobs held by the two genders and different races without providing specifics about the salaries in different employment categories. It is well known, though, that programmers and engineers who write the coding for technology products and services are among the highest paid workers besides the companies’ executives. The Labor Department maintains that Google agreed to submit to a higher level of scrutiny when it decided to do business with federal agencies funded by taxpayers. “Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation,” said Thomas Dowd, acting director of the Labor Department’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.

Below is everything you need to know about Nexus Android Nougat updates. Advertisement Many of the features users love on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are exclusive to that phone. However, with Android 7.1.1 Nougat some are available for all Android devices, starting with Nexus phones.

Read: Google Pixel Review: A New Generation of Android As promised, in December the final Android 7.1.1 Nexus update arrived for Nexus smartphones and tablets.

The first release had some new software features first shown off on the Pixel. Some of those included round icons, app shortcuts on the homescreen and launcher icons, image and GIF support in the keyboard, Night Light and more. The second developer preview looks to mostly be bug fixes, and added a slew of new emoji characters. Which Devices Are Getting Android 7.1.1 Nougat?

Furthermore, the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel C tablet, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player are getting it too. Google claimed the Nexus 6 would be added on the 2nd preview, but that never happened.

My Pixel C tablet didn’t get it until December 26th, and others could be experiencing the same problem. How to Get Android 7.1.1 Nougat There are multiple ways to install Android 7.1.1 Nougat today. The easiest of them all however, is to just wait for the over-the-air notification on your device. If you haven’t received it yet, follow any of the steps below.

This is more intensive, requires a full wipe and erase of the device, and is more involved. Then the third method is similar to the beta and over the air update, just done manually. Basically side-loading the update files. This takes some know-how, and will not erase your device. Those on the beta cannot side-load from it to the official build without a full wipe. Android 7.1.1 Nougat Release Date As of right now 7.1.1 Nougat is only available for the devices mentioned above, and running on Pixel phones. It was released on December 5th and now in 2017 everyone should have it. Advertisement If you own the Nexus 6 by Motorola, we have good news. After a short wait Google released factory images and all files of Android 7.1.1 on January 5th. Enjoy it. In closing, those with a Nexus or Pixel are getting the January security patch starting on the 3rd. Expect OTAs to rollout for the first 7-10 days of January. Those with devices from Samsung and others will need to wait a little while longer for Nougat. Motorola and OnePlus are the few to already release Nougat for their devices. At this point there is no information to suggest Google is working on a version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat, but other maintenance releases could be on the way as 2017 continues. That all said for those who aren’t enjoying Nougat, here are fixes for any potential problems you may be facing. 14 Responses 10/20/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply Android 7.1 Developer Preview now available for Nexus 5X, 6P and Pixel C 11/28/2016 John Mitton Reply Google released final Android 7.1.1 Developer sample 2 for Nexus devices earlier this week.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Verizon-Verizon+ Android-Android+ Google-Google+ If you're a Verizon customer, you might be still waiting for the delivery of your 128GB Google Pixel XL. You might recall that Verizon has had trouble keeping this model of Google's first smartphone in stock. Today, one of our loyal readers told us about his order for the phone, which was made on November 26th of last year as part of Verizon's Black Friday sale. The original ship date for the phone was January 6th, which proves that our loyal reader has great patience to begin with. January 6th was yesterday, and instead of receiving his new Google designed, HTC built handset, he received an email telling him that the phone won't be shipped until March 3rd. And who knows if the phone will even be shipped then? We understand that the 128GB Pixel XL is very popular, and we get that delays can occur. But waiting an additional two months seems like a long time. Hopefully, Google and HTC can make up the backlog quicker than expected and ship our reader's 128GB Pixel XL ahead of the new shipping date. Otherwise, no one could blame him if he decided to switch to a different phone. 128GB Pixel XL, expected to ship January 6th, will not be in transit until March 3rd Thanks for sending this in!

Then it will about 2 weeks. So clearly this has something to do with Verizon. Maybe Verizon wants others to buy some other phones instead. Verizon might want users to buy a phone that is in their inventory. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 10:09 0 in response to #37 in response to #37 Hide Reply 39. 14545 (Posts: 1633; Member since: 22 Nov 2011) Good point. I didn't know that. Thanks for the info. It could be to try and push people that don't know better to the smaller "memory" devices and use the "unlimited cloud storage" to increase the chances of them using more data. I would honestly be ok if the carriers weren't allowed to sell/manage phones themselves since they are incentivized to lie and cost people more money in the long term. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 16:22 0 in response to #37 in response to #37 Hide Reply 50. bigdawg23 (Posts: 458; Member since: 25 May 2011) That's is the Standard Pixel. The Pixel XL 128GB has been out of stock in the Play Store for long time, so issue as VZW posted on 08 Jan 2017, 11:40 1 Reply 43. Scott93274 (Posts: 5130; Member since: 06 Aug 2013) No one ever says "fake demand", they say "artificial demand" as inventory is deliberately kept lower than projected sales. In the Case of the Pixel, this is the first time Google has released its own phone with this level of marketing, there are no past sales records to gauge how much stock they needed to be prepared to sell. Don't get me wrong, this is terribly unfortunate that they cannot meet the demand, though I'm sure it's nowhere near as high as the iPhone. I expect that with the Pixel 2, Google will ensure that they will be far better prepared to meet the demand. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 14:53 0 Reply 47. JackDiesel (Posts: 11; Member since: 03 Oct 2015) It's worst case scenario, I ordered one the day it came out and was supposed to be delivered on the 12th but Verizon f**ked up the address and it was returned to sender. So I ordered another one on the 12th and got it on the 28th. People are getting them way before the estimated ship date. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 15:25 0 in response to #47 in response to #47 Hide Reply 48. trojan_horse (Posts: 2492; Member since: 06 May 2016) "People are getting them way before the estimated ship date." But those people are obviously the minority... not the vast majority of those who pre-ordered the Pixel XL and still yet to get it. posted on 07 Jan 2017, 17:44 25 Reply 2.

I have also been waiting since that date and I received an email that looked just like that, only mine said March 10. Called Verizon yesterday and they said they don't make jokes like that in the title and the date hadn't changed yet. Also there is no account number in the email and all Verizon emails have the users account number in them. Did some research on the email it was sent from and apparently it is not Verizon sending them. You have to contact them and tell them to check their account before it's hacked! posted on 08 Jan 2017, 00:34 3 Reply 31.

I just hope that they learn from this mistake and prepare for the Pixel 2 as I plan to get that device. Crossing my fingers for Tango support. It would be a stellar feature/upgrade that very few other phones offer and something Apple won't have for a long time coming if at all. posted on 07 Jan 2017, 18:21 3 Reply 13.

Jealous that Pixel owners get to have all the VR fun? Pick up one of these newly compatible Android smartphones and you'll be Daydreamin' in no time. Josh Miller/CNET Phones by Gordon Gottsegen January 7, 2017 1:27 PM PST Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS When Google revealed its Daydream View in October, it was announced alongside the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. These two "phones by Google" and headset were a match made in VR heaven in some ways, but that also meant you could only experience Daydream by using a Pixel. After that, Google added compatibility to the Moto Z. Now it's expanding the list of Daydream-compatible phones a bit more with the Huawei Mate 9 Pro, Asus ZenFone AR and ZTE Axon 7. If you're in the market for a Daydream phone, you have a few options to choose from. The six compatible phones bring different things to the table. For example, the Pixel phones will automatically get the latest Android updates as they're made available, while the Moto Z has the option to attach Moto Mod accessories. The three new phones offer their own unique features, like the dual cameras in the Mate 9 Pro, the dual SIM in the Axon 7 or Tango AR compatibility in the ZenFone AR. So which phone you pick depends on the features you want -- and the price, of course. Luckily CNET's got your back and came up with the following chart for easy side-by-side comparison.

Advertisement Earlier this year, Google released an Android Nougat Developer Preview, a beta that allowed anyone with a compatible device to test the update ahead of its public release. The Android 7.0 Nougat beta delivered new and important features but it also caused problems for us and many other Nexus users. In August, Google released the final version of the Nexus Android 7.0 Nougat update. And while the beta wiped out some of these problems, Nexus users are complaining about various issues with the new operating system. As we push deeper into the fall, we’re learning about the Android 7.0 Nougat problems plaguing owners of Nexus smartphones and tablets. Advertisement In response, we’ve put together a roundup that looks at these Nexus Android 7.0 problems, potential fixes for the most common Nougat issues, some places to go if you need to find feedback about the Android 7.0 Nougat update on your device, and what you can expect from the first bug fix update. We will continue to update this with new information so check back for regular updates about problems, fixes and more. How to Prepare for Android 7.0 Nougat Now that Android 7.0 Nougat is out, it’s going to be tempting to make the move from Marshmallow to Nougat. That said, before you make the move to Google’s new operating system, you’ll want to make sure that you’ve prepared. It’s extremely difficult to predict what you might run into after you install Android 7.0 Nougat on your Nexus phone or tablet. It could be flawless, you could see a dramatic drop in performance. It’s impossible to say. So, you’ll want to take a few minutes to prepare. Advertisement You’ll want to take a look at the step-by-step through the process we use before we install an Android update. A little prep work will go a long way toward preventing serious issues. Take your time with Android 7.0 Nougat. It’s not going anywhere. Android 7.0 Nougat Problems The Android 7.0 Nougat update is a solid upgrade for Nexus smartphones and tablets but it’s far from perfect. Android 7.0 Nougat problems feature the usual complaints about the installation process. A number of users have experienced issues side-loading the new software. This is a common complaint. If you’re having issues, take a look at our guide. It’ll walk you through the process. Nexus 5X owners are reporting boot loops after installing Android 7.0 Nougat. However, Google is claiming that it’s a hardware problem and not a software problem which means it likely won’t be able to fix the issue with an update. It appears that the only solution, at least for right now, is to get in contact with the retailer and ask for a replacement. We’re also seeing complaints about busted/sound speakers, various performance issues including lag, abnormal battery drain, issues with Wi-Fi, issues with Bluetooth, problems moving from the Developer Preview, problems with various applications and Google Now, and more. Those merely scratch the surface. Hi @google and @Android the new #Nougat update keeps cutting out #Bluetooth on my #car.

Error writing file when anyone sends me any file/voice @BlackBerryHelp — Adam (@Massonite) August 26, 2016 The good news is that we haven’t (at least not yet) heard about any widespread Nexus Android 7.0 Nougat problems. That could, of course, change at a moment’s notice so you’ll want to be extremely careful with your device and this update. Where to Find Android 7.0 Feedback As we move away from Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat release date, you’ll want to keep tabs on performance. Doing this will alert you to potential Android 7.0 Nougat problems on your device. And if you’re on the fence about installing Android 7.0 on your phone or tablet, it’ll help you get to one side of the fence or the other. Most of you will probably wind up installing Nougat on your Nexus device but it might be wise to get a second opinion before you do so. We recently dug into the Nexus 5X Android 7.0 Nougat update so that’s a great place to start if you’re looking for feedback about the update’s general performance . There are a number of other resources out there. We’re starting to see feedback go up on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, Google’s Nexus Help forums, XDA-Developers, YouTube, and Android-centric forums like Android Central forums. If you’re dealing with Android 7.0 Nougat problems or you’re worried about the potential for Nougat problems on your device, dig into the feedback there. How to Fix Android 7.0 Nougat Problems If you’re already experiencing an Android 7.0 problem on your device or if you simply want to prepare ahead of your Android 7.0 update, you’ll want to take a look at our list of fixes for common Nexus Android 7.0 Nougat issues. Our list includes potential fixes for Wi-Fi problems, Bluetooth issues, and other bugs that typically pop up after a major Nexus update release. We’ve also put together another guide that will show you how to fix Nexus Android 7.0 Nougat battery life problems. These fixes for Nexus Android problems have worked for many people in the past but they aren’t guaranteed to work on your phone or tablet. If you can’t find a fix there, take at Google’s Nexus Help Forums. There are some very knowledgeable and polite Nexus users located there. If not there, head over to XDA-Developers, or your favorite Android-centric forum for other potential remedies. What’s Next In its August Android 7.0 Nougat announcement, Google told Nexus owners it had already started work on the next major Android Nougat update. At the time, it didn’t confirm the version. Now we know that update is Android 7.1. Before its official release in December (for the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, and Pixel C), Google’s released an Android 7.1 Developer Preview for the Nexus 6P, Pixel C, and Nexus 5X.G The Android 7.1 Developer Preview is now available to those who are enrolled in Google’s Android Beta program. If you are experiencing major issues on Android 7.0 or if you’re curious about Android 7.1’s performance, you might consider installing this preview. Betas typically aren’t good alternatives to official software but there’s a chance you’ll see some improvements with Android 7.1 on board. The next three quarterly maintenance releases of Android Nougat will be Android 7.1 / 7.1.1 / 7.1.2 — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 28, 2016 The Android 7.1 Nougat change log for older Nexus devices isn’t confirmed but we expect it to come with some crucial bug fixes for Android Noguat problems. Android 7.1 will also come with some brand new features. Google will also continue to roll out its monthly security updates though you can’t rely on those to bring bug fixes for Nougat problems. Keep an eye out for details about security updates and the next Nougat update as we into the month of November. 9 Things to Do Before Installing Android 7.1.1 Nougat Get Familiar with Android 7.1.1 Nougat   1 / 9 One of the first things you'll want to do before installing Android 7.1.1 Nougat is to get familiar with the update. Blindly installing Android 7.1.1 Nougat on your device is a bad idea, particularly for novice Android users. If you haven't been following the Developer Preview, now would be a great time to get acquainted with Android 7.1.1 and its various changes. There are many. Some are big and obvious. Others are much smaller and harder to locate.  We've put together a guide that will walk you through Android 7.1.1 Nougat versus Android 7.0 Nougat and Android Marshmallow. If you're coming to 7.1.1 from Android 7.0 Nougat or Marshmallow, and we assume most of you are, this will come in handy.  Google's also outlined many of the update's key ingredients and you can take a look at those right here and right here.  It's in your benefit to dig into the update prior to installing it. This way, you won't be caught off guard by any of the changes.    1 / 9 18 Responses 09/12/2016 Patricia Heil (@PatTheTerrible) Reply My Nougat upgrade seems to have gone very well. I read your article on battery life problems and for a newbie like me, it’s too hard to figure out the more extreme fixes. The easy ones I’ve pre-empted by not running some of those apps. Also, the check on battery draining apps showed NO apps in the list. Weird. It’s a Nexus 5X in case that’s important. I’m enjoying it, the camera app is great and the audio is fair. Thanks for the info. 10/21/2016 Dakota Bastow (xScottyMcGee) Reply I find this all really interesting. My update has been flawless. And if anything my battery life has improved! 09/12/2016 Patricia Heil (@PatTheTerrible) Reply There you are, as Catwoman said to Batman. I have Android System, not OS as you warned, using 1-2% of the battery. 09/24/2016 Gary SainTamey Reply I’ll probably wait a bit after new Android Nougat is released to public. No rush,my older Nexus 7-2013]tablet has ALWAYS updated with NO problems in the past, will let some of the bugs get fixed, might update in 90days,etc..no worries.. “IF” Android OS was on a laptop, I’d buy one asap, it’s been the easiest to learn, easiest to update and makes OSX or Windows seem SO outdated and difficult in comparison! 09/27/2016 Nate paul Reply Android is on laptops they have the highest market share. 09/25/2016 keithalanfisher Reply This article is completely useless to me. My problem has been applications routinely stopping on open. They restart as expected but I’m usually torturing Google with “stoppage” feedback, in which I continually imply my Nexus 5X is constipated with nougat. I have seen quick battery drain. Be mindful of Wi-Fi being on but not connected to any network. And sadly, I think, using a Nexus 5X as a Hotspot is a disaster waiting to happen, even before Nougat arrived. If you bought a Speck case, remove it when using Wi-Fi as a Hotspot. The battery gets way too hot and my unit has shut down in the past to preserve itself. (I guess you gotta give LG/Google credit for hardware design that won’t allow your smartphone to melt.) 09/25/2016 Michael Caley Reply Since Nougat is not out for my Nexus 6, I was running preview 5 which seemed ok, but switched back to 6.0.1 with xposed and gravity box and elemental x runs real well. 09/27/2016 ˈÄrkän ˈSābər Reply I did the same here. I rolled back to Marshmallow 6.0.1 after trying Nougat Dev Preview 5 on the Nexus 6. I’m not rushing to install the Final Build. Surprisingly, the Nexus 9 got the OTA Nougat Final Build. No issues so far. Like you said. I might as well put on xPosed, Gravity Box & Elemental X while waiting. CyanogenMod seems to be pushing CM14 quickly enough that I might skip the Nexus factory images altogether. 10/04/2016 FanDroid Reply Are the users having issues using OTA or factory update? * With major OS upgrades, I HIGHLY recommend doing factory install * After install completes, do a Recover Mode –> Factory Data Wipe. Any time I’ve had issues flashing, doing a factory wipe *most often* fixes most issues. 10/04/2016 Michael James Gibbons Reply Wow what a terribly written article. Took forever to even start mentioning what the issues are then was completely vague and disorganised about that. Try proof reading please 10/04/2016 FanDroid Reply It’s out now :-) Nexus 6: factory image https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/shamu-nbd90z-factory-92e7bb05.zip 10/04/2016 FanDroid Reply Have you tried doing Factory Data Wipe since you updated? 10/12/2016 Alexandra Adina Reply Completely useless article. 10/21/2016 Travis Coble Reply I just updated to 7.1… And while it adds some VERY nice new features, I’m having one huge brand new issue: CANNOT SIDELOAD APKS! 😣 10/21/2016 AD Reply So much bs mulling over the same point over and over again just to make the article longer. Article is overly stuffed with keywords, which makes it annoying to read. The whole point could be made in few concise sentences.. 1. Users report long installation times, boot loops, worsen battery longevity.. 2. Here are few tips to fix / workaround it (click this other ad-filled link) 3. Don’t forget about Dev Preview available to Android beta users, if you want bleeding edge 7.1, etc.. 10/21/2016 Mjt Reply No problems on the Nexus 6 with stock or with EX kernel. Battery life has been great. 11/08/2016 Marc Louie Yap Reply Fixed all problems by doing a factory reset. Camera performance improved, battery life improved, image quality in HDR mode improved.. 01/07/2017 Rosetta Reply Call Nexus support and they will extend your warranty! Just tell them about your circumstance that your nexus is stuck in a boot loop because of the Nougat update. I got my warranty extended just now! Yay! finally somewhat resolved!

Just ask anyone: “Alexa Just Conquered CES. The World Is Next,” read one Wired headline. CNBC, the BBC, MIT Technology Review, and many others all had equally laudatory reports. Companies like Ford, Huawei, LG, as well as a long parade of startups, all unveiled home appliances, phones, cars, and more gadgets with Alexa integration. It’s a reflection of the sheer power that Amazon is starting to wield in the nascent smart home market, as a growing number of people come to rely on their Echo devices to run their homes and to automate their lives. The market for the Echo is still small compared to smartphones, but it’s growing fast. Google already has the Google Home, its own voice-enabled speaker, designed to compete with the Amazon Echo. Microsoft partnered with Harmon to bring its Cortana virtual assistant to a smart speaker. Even Apple is rumoured to be working on a dedicated Siri speaker. But so far Amazon is the smart speaker to beat, with an early start and plenty of buzz. Business InsiderLeft to right: The Amazon Echo Dot, Echo Tap, and Echo devices all make Alexa available via voice commands. More importantly though, the rise of the Echo heralds a changing tech landscape that could spell big trouble for Google. No matter how many Google Home devices the search giant sells, Google will be playing on a field that’s tilted in Amazon’s favour. The rise of Alexa A big part of Amazon’s early success with Alexa is due to the fact that the company didn’t oversell it. After years of iPhone users getting let down by Siri, the first truly mainstream voice agent, Amazon billed the Echo as a speaker that, by the way, has a few smart voice commands built in. Then, just as people got accustomed to the idea of talking to Alexa, and positive word of mouth spread, Amazon added more capabilities. Alexa now boasts thousands of “skills” that allow it to connect with apps like Uber, Twitter, and Bloomberg news. That’s helped Alexa and the Echo speaker earn a position as the central hub in so-called smart homes. Alexa’s voice-first interface is the perfect way to manage internet-connected lights, door locks, and thermostats — it’s way more intuitive than having to pull out a tablet or phone every two seconds. BI Intelligence But here’s the crucial part. The Echo also makes it super-easy to buy stuff, specifically stuff from Amazon. Alexa can play music from streaming services like Spotify, but it defaults to using Amazon’s own Prime Music, which is a pretty key feature for a smart speaker. It’s yet another reason for consumers to get a $99/year Amazon Prime subscription…which also gets you free shipping from Amazon, which encourages you to buy more from Amazon. In other words, whatever else it does, the Amazon Echo is designed to make it easier for you to give more of your money to Amazon. And that slick voice interface for “skills” and for controlling all of your smart home gear ensures that you’re always using the Echo and Alexa. It’s pretty genius, in a diabolical way. Versus Google This is where things get bad for Google. The more Alexa devices that Amazon and its partners sell, the better Amazon does at its core retail business. Every Echo is a customer who is more likely to spend more on books, groceries, music, and movies. Consider Google’s position, though. It can sell as many Google Home devices as it wants. And it’s true that Google is better at search than Amazon, by a country mile. But Google is a search advertising company, not a retail company, and those Google Home devices aren’t delivering ads. (Can you imagine if they did? “OK Google, open the garage door.” “OK, Matt, but listen to this ad for Mailchimp first.”) GoogleGoogle Home Sure Google can use all the data it collects through its Google Home speaker to refine the ads people see on its search engine. But the point is that consumers will be spending less time in front of screens and looking at Google’s search ads. No matter how good Google’s search ads are, it doesn’t matter if people aren’t seeing them. In fact, we’re already seeing some of this: Amazon is beating Google in the vital area of e-commerce search, because Amazon is the go-to destination for buying things. And thanks to the popularity of Amazon’s Alexa, that’s likely to continue. Voice technology is still in its very early stages, and smartphones aren’t going away anytime soon. And none of this is to say that Google’s problems are insurmountable. It wasn’t so long ago that investors were convinced that Facebook couldn’t monetise its mobile app. Today, Facebook is one of the primary mobile ad platforms. Google could certainly pull off a similar coup. But the direction in which computing is moving is clear, and as things stand now, Google’s weakness looks like Amazon’s strength. And with Alexa on the rise, the clock is ticking for Google.

The refrigerator incorporates Amazon's Alexa, which allows consumers to use “voice control” to order food items, stream videos and music, monitor food contents and much more through the refrigerator’s glass touchscreen panel. (Jack Dempsey/AP Images for LG Electronics) | Caption Julia Love Reuters January 7, 2017 Las Vegas—Amazon.com Inc's digital assistant appeared almost everywhere at the CES technology show this week in Las Vegas, even making an unexpected appearance on rival Google's Android system. Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp to Ford Motor Co unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co , which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told Walt Mossberg at the Recode conference that Alexa would be the "fourth pillar" of the company's business.  Inventions that were going to change the world – but didn’t Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google's voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that's a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue," he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company's Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. "It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services," he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × As The Christian Science Monitor reported, Ford is likely to be the first US carmaker to debut Alexa this summer. But writer Ben Rosen notes that most new vehicles today have software that connects to a smartphone and allows drivers to place phone calls or dictate texts hands free. Carmakers have gradually been improving these features to offer drivers more convenience as well as combat distracted driving. But some transportation safety experts and advocacy groups warn that such technology isn’t necessarily safer. Voice commands might keep drivers’ hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. But prompting, say, Apple’s Siri or Amazon's Alexa can be just as mentally distracting to drivers. They say it is up to both drivers and the auto industry to realize this technology should improve driving first, and add convenience and entertainment to the driving experience second. “If you start composing tweets while you’re driving, that’s a cognitive distraction. It’s not going to help you control, guide, or navigate the vehicle,” says David Hurwitz, an associate professor of transportation engineering at Oregon State University. “The more functionality we add to vehicles, the greater potential we add for in-vehicle distraction. That’s concerning. We need to think about that more.” While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. "A huge part of an assistant is search," he said. "Google is a search company. Amazon is not."

Happy new year! We hit the ground running this week at the CES tech industry expo, where there were some truly exciting announcements… and one or two unexpected curiosities. If you’ve struggled to keep up with it all, fear not, for 7 Days is back after a short festive break, and here to guide you through the top stories from CES, and across the wider tech world. Let’s waste no more time – there’s a lot to get through! Our journey begins this week in the world of healthcare, as researchers have developed a new computer algorithm that can help to diagnose conditions such as ADHD and autism. Meanwhile, over in the UK, the National Health Service is testing an app powered by artificial intelligence that can offer medical advice to patients based on the symptoms they describe. Almost four months after its release, Apple revealed that iOS 10 is now installed on 76% of active iOS devices. The first iOS 10.3 beta is expected to arrive next week, with a mysterious new ‘Theatre Mode’. A video published on Friday gave us our first look at an early prototype of an iPod-based operating system developed by Apple for its original iPhone, including a virtual touchscreen scroll wheel. Frankly, it looks pretty awful, so it’s a huge relief that they ended up chucking it in the bin. Intel formally launched its new 7th-generation Core vPro processors, which it says will offer greatly improved security features and… “50% increased productivity over a 5-year-old PC”. Wow? The company also touted the prowess of its consumer-class 7th-gen (Kaby Lake) Core processors, and outlined its hopes for the virtual reality market, saying that it expects 2017 to be a big year for VR. Qualcomm announced its Snapdragon 835 chipset, which features new optimizations for virtual and augmented reality scenarios. The powerful new SoC will launch on flagship-class devices in the next few months, promising 25% less power consumption, Quick Charge 4 support, and more. Nvidia officially announced its anticipated GTX 1050 and 1050Ti graphics cards for laptops, promising powerful performance for budget-conscious buyers. Nvidia also revealed a new Shield TV streaming device with 4K and HDR support. The device includes voice control features and support for Google Assistant. Google revealed that it’s bringing its digital Assistant to Android TV devices running both 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat. Google said it received a massive one billion takedown requests for its search engine in 2016 – twice the amount it got the year before. It looks like Google may finally be preparing to bring its YouTube Red subscription service to European markets this year. And at long last, it seems Google is getting ready to roll out Android 7.1.1 Nougat to the Nexus 6, over a month after its release for other devices. The company also released its January security updates for Android this week. Samsung began rolling out Android 7.0 to a very limited number of its Galaxy S7 handsets on Wednesday. And with just a few hours of 2016 remaining, OnePlus made good on its promise to release its Android 7.0 upgrade to its 3 and 3T flagships before the end of the year. OnePlus delivering an update on time… is that a first? Following the recent collapse of Cyanogen, British device manufacturer Wileyfox said that it will replace Cyanogen OS on its handsets with a ‘pure’ Android experience. A photo showing a slide presented at a Nokia event revealed the company’s plans to launch as many as seven Android smartphones by the end of 2017. The slide proudly declared “The Empire Strikes Back”... consequently reminding everyone that Nokia’s empire, and its share price, have crumbled over the last decade. On Saturday, a leaked image purportedly revealed key specs of the 'Nokia 6', one of the first Android smartphones on the way. BlackBerry is another fallen mobile empire that’s trying to rise again by licensing its brand to another company to build Android devices. This week, TCL showed off its new BlackBerry phone with a QWERTY keyboard – and then said it wouldn’t talk about it until February, by which time everyone will have completely lost interest. Great strategy. LG revealed a change of strategy for its new G6 flagship phone, confirming that it’s ditching the modular design of its current G5, which has been a sales flop. Xiaomi unveiled a white version of its Mi MIX ‘concept’ device… …while Huawei’s Honor brand showed off its new Magic concept device in the flesh – and we managed to get our hands on it. Honor also announced the launch of its ‘mid-range flagship’, the 6X, in the US and Europe. Huawei brought its Mate 9 flagship to the US too, priced at $599, and revealed that it will add support for Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant later this year. ZTE revealed its new upper-mid-range handset, the Blade V8 Pro, with a Snapdragon 625 processor, 3GB RAM, 32GB storage, 13MP camera, USB Type-C port, and more. Check out our hands-on first impressions of the device here. Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy A series handsets – and as rumored, they all include IP68 dust- and water-resistance. That’s a very nice addition to the mid-range devices. After the disastrous launch, and subsequent global recall, of its Galaxy Note7 flagship, Samsung said that it will reveal the findings of its investigation into the battery fires that plagued the device “later this month”. Image: All About Windows Phone But it looks like Samsung’s next flagship, the Galaxy S8, will include a rather intriguing feature. An image revealed the company’s plans to introduce a “desktop experience” to the new Android device with support for an external monitor, mouse and keyboard – which sounds rather a lot like the Continuum mode in Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft was planning to release a new Fast ring preview of its Windows 10 Creators Update this week, but those plans were postponed while the company addresses some issues with the update process. However, Windows 10 Enterprise build 15002 – believed to be the same build that was due for release – leaked onto the web late on Friday night. However, Microsoft did officially roll out Windows 10 build 14393.594 (Anniversary Update) to PCs and phones in the Release Preview ring. Microsoft hasn’t officially provided a firm launch date for the Creators Update, saying only that it will be released in “early 2017”. But Dell let the cat out of the bag this week, confirming that the Creators Update is due to roll out in April. The Creators Update will include support for 802.11ad Wi-Fi, and wireless docking support for that protocol will be added in a future update. Image: MSPoweruser After the Creators Update, the Redstone 3 update is expected to arrive towards the end of the year. That update will include changes to the user interface, developed under the codename ‘Project Neon’ – and the first screenshots previewing Windows 10’s design refresh leaked on Thursday, showing a cleaner, less cluttered look with new blurring and transparency effects. Microsoft promised more transparency and new insights into its Windows 10 development process this year, as it launched a new blog focused on the Windows Insider community. Elsewhere, Microsoft hit back at inaccurate media reports (not from Neowin!), which claimed that it’s killing off its Command Prompt in the Windows 10 Creators Update. In fact, it’s prioritizing its more versatile PowerShell command line experience over the antiquated Command Prompt, but the latter will still remain in the OS. Data from NetMarketShare revealed that Windows 10 is now installed on almost a quarter of PCs, with Windows 7 approaching 50%, and macOS X 10.11 on 4.38%. On the Steam gaming platform, Windows 10 is now in use by more than half of all gamers, 17 months after its launch. Meanwhile, Microsoft appears to be working on a new cross-platform media-sharing service, currently known as ‘Belize’. Microsoft has been working with numerous automotive giants in recent months to establish its products at the heart of their connected car strategies. BMW, for example, unveiled its vision for self-driving cars with Cortana support, while Nissan is also among other major manufacturers to be working with Microsoft and its Connected Vehicle Platform. Audi has teamed up with Nvidia on its self-driving car program, in an effort to infuse more of its vehicles with autonomous control technologies powered by artificial intelligence. Mmm buzzwords. Casio was among the many companies attending CES this week, revealing a new $500 Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch. Take a look at our hands-on impressions of the rugged wearable device. But it was the giants of the tech industry that made some of the biggest announcements in the greatest numbers. Dell was among them, unveiling a series of new devices, including the Inspiron 7000 gaming laptops with Nvidia's latest GTX 1050 GPUs… …and the Latitude 5285 and Latitude 7285 – two new business-class Windows 10 2-in-1s, promising exceptional security and versatility. The latter device also offers wireless charging support. Dell also unveiled a new XPS 13 2-in-1, and the 27 Ultrathin Monitor… …as well as the stunning UltraSharp 8K Monitor – the first commercially available monitor with 8K resolution, and an unsurprisingly high price tag. But most excitingly, Dell also revealed the XPS 27 all-in-one PC, and the Canvas – an intriguing new competitor to Microsoft’s new Surface Studio. Stardock announced that it has been working with Dell on an exclusive version of its desktop organization suite, Fences, for the new Canvas PC. Don’t miss our hands-on first impressions of Dell’s new devices here! HP unveiled the second generation of its unusual Sprout Pro Windows 10 PC, which has an integrated projector and touch-mat, along with 2D and 3D scanning capabilities. Of course, we went hands-on to see what all the fuss was about – you can see it in action in our videos here. HP’s new ENVY Curve AIO 34 all-in-one PC also made its debut at CES, along with the OMEN X 35 curved monitor. And the 15.6-inch HP Spectre x360 and EliteBook x360 also made their first appearance at the show, both with 4K displays. We went hands-on with both devices here, so make sure you check that out! Lenovo also had plenty of announcements at CES, including that of its new Smart Assistant, an Amazon Echo-style speaker... powered by Amazon’s Alexa assistant. Lenovo unveiled three new ThinkPad X1 devices, and the Miix 720 – a high-end Surface Pro-style tablet, including an integrated rear kickstand. Check out our hands-on videos and photos of those new devices here, along with our impressions of the Smart Assistant. Two Lenovo gaming laptops were announced too, kicking off the company’s new line of Legion gaming PCs. Lenovo launched its new 500 Multimedia Controller, a $55 wireless keyboard for media PCs, on which the keys also double up as a capacitive touchpad with support for Windows 10 gestures. Last month, Microsoft revealed new information on its plans with hardware partners to launch more affordable virtual reality headsets powered by its Windows Holographic shell on Windows 10. Lenovo showed off its VR headset at CES, and said it will launch later this year for under $400. We also got a look at new Windows Holographic VR headsets from HP, Dell and others. CES played host to the rise of the machines, as many companies showed off home robots at the event. The cute new Kuri robotic companion is now available to pre-order for $699. LG also displayed a range of new robots, destined for both home and commercial use. LG announced its new family of thin and light Windows 10 notebooks, claiming that they offer up to 24 hours of battery life… but we’ll have to put that claim to the test in the real world before we can believe it. The LG Stylo 3 and 3 Plus made an appearance too. The two lower-mid-range handsets each have an integrated stylus and come with Android 7.0. Lots of manufacturers revealed new TVs at CES, and LG was no exception. Its range of 4K TVs come with ‘Nano Cell’ technology, said to offer superior color and clarity from any viewing angle. And like so many other devices at CES, LG’s new smart refrigerator includes Amazon Alexa voice support, along with a 29-inch touchscreen and internal camera. Samsung also introduced a new range of smart fridges, including models with a 21.5-inch touchscreen, and its new Family Hub 2.0 software. The Samsung Notebook Odyssey was revealed as the company’s first gaming laptop, featuring some rather meaty specs… and a rather ugly trackpad design. Bleugh. Pre-orders also opened for Samsung’s new Notebook 9, which it calls “the lightest notebook on the market”. Samsung believes its new ‘QLED TVs’ have what it takes to crush all of their rivals, thanks to their use of Quantum Dot technology. Image: Bloomberg Sony made quite an impression with its new ultra-thin BRAVIA OLED TV range, available in three sizes up to 77 inches. They won’t come cheap, so you’d better start saving and/or selling some body organs if you’re thinking of buying one. Xiaomi’s new TVs are also incredibly thin – but they’re rather interesting for another reason too. They have a modular design, which will allow owners to upgrade them in the future by adding new components. Asus revealed new displays designed for computing. It introduced a pro-grade 32-inch 4K monitor with HDR support, along with an enormous 37.5-inch curved ultra-wide monitor, featuring ‘frameless bezels’, and integrated Qi wireless charging plate. Asus also unveiled the ZenFone AR, the first phone in the world to support both Google’s Tango augmented reality suite, and the Daydream virtual reality platform. There’s no doubting the fact that it’s got some pretty decent specs – but it’s not exactly attractive. Miraxess is preparing to launch a new laptop-style phone dock for Android and Windows 10 Mobile devices, similar to the $599 HP Lap Dock for its flagship-class Elite x3 handset. However, the Mirabook will cost half that amount. Meanwhile, Brydge revealed its new laptop-style aluminum keyboard for Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 tablet. There seemed to be no end of PCs on display at CES this year, so it was certainly appropriate that Endless attended the event to unveil its simple, affordable mini-PCs, priced from $129. And after announcing the Sirius A in October, Ockel showed up at CES ready to show off the curious mini-PC in the flesh. The device has a 6-inch touchscreen, but runs the full version of Windows 10 Home, and has an integrated DisplayPort, full-size HDMI, two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, one USB 3.0 Type C port and a full-size Ethernet port too. More photos and details of the Sirius A and Ockel’s other mini-PCs can be found here. Toshiba turned up with a far more conventional Windows 10 device. Its new Portégé X20W notebook is a 2-in-1 that promises up to 16 hours of battery life. Acer showed off a range of new notebooks and desktops too – but the star of its show stand was the mighty Predator 21 X gaming notebook that it announced in August. The monstrous machine – which has a curved 21-inch display – finally got a price tag… and it’s enormous. Not to be outdone, Razer turned up to CES with an even crazier device. Project Valerie is a gloriously insane notebook with three (!!!) built-in displays, each with 4K resolution, powered by a desktop-class Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. Mad. Quite mad. Razer also took things to a whole new level with the unveiling of its Project Ariana concept, a room-scale projector that aims to turn gaming into a truly immersive experience. Back on Planet Earth, Sony revealed that it has now sold an impressive 53.4 million PlayStation 4 consoles since its launch in 2013, including 6.2 million in just six weeks over the holiday season. Despite being outsold by the PS4, Microsoft nonetheless celebrated its Xbox achievements in 2016, and promised an even more exciting year ahead for its gaming platform. But this week’s odyssey around the tech world ends, appropriately, at CES, where the L’Oreal/Withings smart hairbrush won an innovation award. All hope is lost. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. I looked back on a remarkable year for Microsoft, in which it became one of the world's most exciting tech companies. I also took a look ahead to what's in store for Microsoft in 2017 - from gaming and new devices, to productivity and mixed reality, it's set to be a year of work, play, and creativity unleashed for the company. Vlad Dudau shared a mini-review of the MGCool Band 2, an ultra-affordable fitness tracker with some very nice features... but there's certainly room for improvement. And Christopher White published his detailed review of the Thecus W2810PRO, a NAS (network attached storage) device running Windows Storage Server 2012 R2 Essentials. Who comes up with these names? Anyway, the W2810PRO earned itself a very good score in the review, but there are still a few downsides to be aware of. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend and a very happy new year!

Advertisement Android 7.0 Nougat is loaded with new features, improved battery life, multi-window mode and more. Nexus and Pixel owners have been enjoying it for some time, and now it’s OnePlus’ turn. The company announced the beta is over, and the stable release is rolling out now to kick off 2017. Read: Android 7.1 Nougat vs Android 6.0: What’s New The Android N developer test ended in August and was quickly released for select devices. There are beta programs from LG, Samsung, Sony and more. Earlier this year we learned the OnePlus 3 Nougat beta was coming in November. Now after two months of testing, it’s ready for all users. Read on for more details. Advertisement Advertisement Popular smartphones from all major manufacturers will see a free update to Android 7.0 Nougat or Android 7.1.1 in the near future. Samsung finished their beta, Motorola already updates phones, and more are coming. Some of the most popular smartphones of 2015 and 2016 are from OnePlus. A company that delivers high-end flagship devices at a wallet friendly price point. The OnePlus 3 is as good as the Galaxy S7 Edge, but for only $399. Not to mention the even better OnePlus 3T for $439, which rivals Google’s own Pixel. Earlier this year OnePlus blend the two teams working on the OS for China and the rest of the world into one group. An effort to bring the latest software and features to all devices at a faster pace. It seems to have worked, because the OnePlus 3 Android 7.0 Nougat update is now available. OnePlus Android 7.0 Nougat Updates While we can expect a slew of devices to see updates, the company is starting with the most important ones first. Those being the 3 and 3T. Then we can look forward to the OnePlus X, and potentially the OP2 from 2015. The company promised updates would arrive before the end of December, and technically they hit that mark. The community beta test is over, and OnePlus leader Carl Pei had this to say on Twitter. Advertisement 2) Android N stable OTA for the OP3 and the OP3T. Gradual rollout will begin later tonight. — Carl Pei (@getpeid) December 31, 2016 On December 31st the OnePlus 3 and 3T received the official “over-the-air” update to Android Nougat. Some got it right away, others saw a slight delay. Expect all updates to conclude by January 14th. Giving OnePlus two weeks to deliver it to all users. On January 9th OnePlus confirmed another Nougat update is rolling out with fixes and tweaks. Alternatively, those who don’t want to wait for the OTA can flash the software themselves. For now only the latest two phones are getting updates. More are coming at a later date. Don’t expect the original to receive Android 7.0 Nougat officially. That said, the developer community at the OnePlus forums or XDA will surely have a version available for download. The OnePlus 2 will get Android 7.0 Nougat Advertisement In closing, the company has confirmed the OnePlus 2 will indeed be updated to Android Nougat. There is no timeframe yet, but we’ll update once we know more. What’s New in Android 7.0 Nougat Our link at the top of the page is an in-depth look at Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow vs Android 7.0 Nougat. Including everything that’s new and different with comparison photos. It goes over many of the key changes, so start there. Including changes in Android 7.1.1 Nougat. As a quick recap, the OnePlus Android 7.0 update will bring improved performance, better battery life with “Doze” features, better split-screen multitasking, the recent apps button works like ALT+TAB and switches between the last used apps, and much more. Google has over 50 big changes in Android N. Like faster app installs, which are also smaller, a new JIT compiler, improved graphics and performance with the Vulkan API, revamped notifications with quick reply from the pulldown bar, customizable quick setting tiles and so much more. Expect all of that to be highlighted on the OnePlus 3 and it’s nearly stock version of Android. Advertisement A huge addition announced at Google IO was “Android Instant Apps” which will enable Android to install small bits of an app (say, from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. No installing an app and starting over. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, uses the app then removes those parts, and we’re done. That has yet to go live, but we’re expecting it by the end of the year. Not to mention things like a better and improved Google Now or Search using the Google Assistant with machine learning, number blocking and call screening, and more than we know under the hood or behind the scenes. OP smartphones run nearly stock Android, similar to the Google Pixel. This means it doesn’t have a huge layer of changes like we see from Samsung, LG or HTC. Allowing the developers to finish updates easier and faster. Technically the update is listed as OxygenOS 4.0 when it hits devices, not labeled as Android Nougat. However, here’s what the upgrade entails. Upgraded to Android 7.0 Nougat New Notifications Design New Settings Menu Design Multi-Window View Notification Direct Reply Custom DPI Support Added Status Bar Icon Options Improved Shelf Customization Final Thoughts In previous years we received slow updates from the company, but that certainly isn’t the case to kick-off 2017. In fact, OnePlus is ahead of Samsung, LG, HTC and many others. Rather than waiting until March or later for the newest release, owners can get it the first week of January. Again, those still waiting on Android 7.0 Nougat for their phone, need to know that it will arrive soon. The company is slowly releasing it to all devices. Then, their team will continue working on the OnePlus 2 Android Nougat update. This is good news for owners, as most didn’t expect such timely updates. The fact that users with a Samsung device are waiting, while OnePlus is sending out Nougat, is a big deal. Enjoy the update to Android 7.0 Nougat, and we’ll update once we know more about incremental upgrades to Android 7.1.1 in the near future. Are you still waiting for it to arrive? If it did, are you experiencing issues?

On display here at CES in Las Vegas, SolarGaps turns the actual slats of your window coverings into solar panels. SolarGaps blinds will be smart enough to shift their angle slightly throughout the day in order to maximize their power intake. The company also plans to integrate with the Google Home. Smart home scoreboard at CES The scoreboard Google Home's progress Alexa's progress Siri's progress I'd love to control solar-powered blinds with my voice using Google's always-listening assistant, but note that Google's smart home language -- Weave -- doesn't actually work with blinds yet. SolarGaps could be extra exciting if it's an indication of a whole new smart home product category for Google Home. Or SolarGaps could be a small tech startup trying to make noise at CES by name-dropping Google. I'm hoping for the former. Google Home aside, SolarGaps will have iOS and Android apps. The company also wants to integrate with Nest and SmartThings. If your Nest senses it's too cold, it could send a signal to your blinds to let in more light and heat your place naturally. 57 Check out all the smart home products at CES 2017 (so far) SolarGaps has a control box that responds to gestures, and the app has the functionality you'd expect -- basic controls and scheduling. SolarGaps blinds should cost between $480 to $890 per square meter of window, and they don't look the part of high-priced designer blinds. They look like big, black solar panels. Still, if you prioritize energy and convenience over style, SolarGaps blinds will be worth keeping an eye on, especially if the company can pull off that Google Home integration. SolarGaps will start a crowdfunding campaign in February for a planned release in the middle of the year. (UK and Australian details weren't available, but those prices convert to roughly £390 and £725 or AU$660 and AU£1,220.)

Name: Subject: Message: 10 best backgrounds and wallpaper apps for Android Apps & Gamesby Joe Hindy1 week ago 16 371 24 15 Finding great wallpapers and backgrounds for your Android device isn’t all that difficult. There are a ton of apps out there that can do the task. On top of that, a simple Google image search can also show you some unique options. The trick is finding the apps that work best for you and finding the kind of stuff you want to see. Let’s take a quick look at the best backgrounds and wallpaper apps for Android! Here are the best HD wallpapers and QHD wallpapers for Android! Or check out some of the best live wallpaper apps that you can find! Customize your home screen more with the best Android themes to go with your new wallpaper! Backdrops [Price: Free with in-app purchases] Backdrops is an above average option if you’re looking for good wallpapers. It features a variety of styles along with some modern features. For instance, you’ll be able to sign in with your Google account to sync wallpapers across devices. It’s a good start for collecting some good wallpapers. The only caveat is that there is a pro version that comes with exclusive wallpapers, and then additional paid content on top of that for more wallpaper packs. It’s not inherently bad, but it can be frustrating if you don’t know it’s coming. It’s one of the better wallpaper apps and it’s worth a shot. Get it now on Google Play! Backgrounds HD [Price: Free] Backgrounds HD has been around for a long time and is one of the most popular wallpaper apps on this list. It’s considered good because it has a metric ton of wallpapers to choose from. Updates in 2015 and 2016 have modernized the design and 30 categories helps keep their massive collection in line. There are a variety of resolutions supported so you may have to wade through some lower quality images to find the really high quality stuff. In any case, the app is completely free so it’s worth a chance. Get it now on Google Play! Cool Wallpapers HD [Price: Free] Cool Wallpapers HD is another one of the most popular wallpaper apps available on mobile. It boasts a staggering collection of 200,000 images that you can choose from. These are laid out in a variety of categories for easy surfing. You can also search for specific wallpapers by using tags or even searching by color. Like most, it also supports favorites so you can find your favorite wallpapers again. It’s a decent app that has definitely gotten better over the course of the last year. It’s also completely free. Get it now on Google Play! MTP Ringtones and Wallpapers [Price: Free] MTP Ringtones and Wallpapers is an all-in-one type of app. Along with wallpapers, you can also find ringtones, alarm tones, notification tones, and other stuff. It boasts a collection of HD photos in the thousands. Like other apps in this category, you can save favorites, search through categories, and set the wallpaper from within the app. It’s one of the more simple wallpaper apps out there. That makes it good if you don’t need a lot of bells and whistles. Still, we wish their selection were a little larger. Get it now on Google Play! Muzei Live Wallpaper [Price: Free] Muzei Live Wallpaper is one of the more unique wallpaper apps. Instead of moving around or doing stuff like most live wallpapers, Muzei is a live wallpaper that just automatically updates your wallpaper over the course of an average day. It will cycle through its own collection of wallpapers or you can create your own. This is a great app for those who like to change it up frequently and its collection is pretty fantastic. Most of its images are classic pieces of artwork which you can learn about as they pop up. It’s completely free to download and use if you’re interested. Get it now on Google Play! See also: The best Android apps, ever! 5 days ago Tapet [Price: Free with in-app purchases] Tapet is a (relatively) newer offering that’s quickly gaining popularity. This app doesn’t offer backgrounds like most wallpaper apps. Instead, this one will generate a wallpaper for you. Once you open the app, you’ll be able to choose from a variety of patterns and colors. The app will then create a wallpaper just for you. It also creates wallpapers based on your device’s screen resolution. That means it’ll be crisp which is what you’re looking for. There’s a free trial to check it out before it asks you to pay anything. Get it now on Google Play! True HD 4K Wallpapers [Price: Free] The name of this app is pretty lame, but thankfully it makes up for it by having a good selection of wallpapers. What makes this app special is that it will only show you wallpapers based on your screen resolution. Therefore, those with 1080p displays won’t see 540×960 images. If you’re rocking a 2K screen or greater, you won’t be bothered by lower resolution stuff. One of the more difficult things to do is find good 2K and 4K wallpapers since a lot of wallpaper apps don’t have that many yet. This gets the bric-a-brac out of the way so you can find those crispy wallpapers. It’s one of the best free wallpaper apps out there. Get it now on Google Play! Wallpapers by Google [Price: Free] Wallpapers by Google is probably the most simple of all the wallpaper apps on this list. It shows a smaller selection of wallpapers, but they are all high resolution. You can access additional wallpapers using Google+, Google Earth, and other sources that Google calls “partners”. You also get additional features if your device is running Android 7.0 Nougat or higher. It’s not the most robust option on the list, but it is completely free and taps into some pretty good sources for wallpapers. Get it now on Google Play! Wonderwall [Price: Free with in-app purchases] Wonderwall is one of the lesser-known wallpaper apps on Android. It doesn’t boast massive collections like Backgrounds HD or Cool Wallpapers, but the collection it does boast is hand picked by the developers. They’re mostly things like photography and abstract creations. All of the images are high resolution and should fit well on most screens. Some additional features include the ability to auto-set wallpapers on your device, submit your own photography to be featured in the app, and some other stuff. It’s also free to use with no advertising which is nice. Get it now on Google Play! Zedge [Price: Free] Last on our list is the venerable Zedge. Zedge is probably the most popular app that offers ringtones, notification tones, alarm tones, and wallpapers. It has quite a large selection of all of those and we always manage to find some obscure stuff stashed in there somewhere. Wallpapers can be searched, sorted by category, and Zedge always has some that are picked out as featured when you open the app. The app isn’t perfect and features some of the more outrageous advertising we’ve seen. Their selections do include HD wallpapers and better, but there isn’t really a way to search to get rid of the lower resolution images. It’s a bit like the wild west, but it’s a good app for those looking around. Get it now on Google Play! Bonus: Google Search [Price: Free] Of course, if none of these apps work for you, then you can always turn to the venerable Google Search. There is a whole section for images there and you can search for backgrounds, wallpapers, and even add in variables to find the types that you want. Let’s face it, Google’s image search has more images than pretty much all of these apps combined which makes it a great option. The only issue is that downloading images can be a pain sometimes and you’ll have to set them manually each time. The best reason to use a Google Search is because you can search for resolutions (2K, 4K, 1920×1080, vertical wallpapers, horizontal wallpapers, etc) which helps filter out a lot of the nonsense that you might not want. It’s a good fallback plan if none of these apps have what you’re looking for! Get it now on Google Play! Related best app lists: Check out the best Android launchers!

Skip to content To Inform is to Influence IO, SC, PD, what's in a name? Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Fake News · Information Warfare Did Media Literacy Backfire? January 7, 2017 Joel Harding danah boydFollow researcher of technology & society | Microsoft Research, Data & Society, NYU | zephoria@zephoria.org Anxious about the widespread consumption and spread of propaganda and fake news during this year’s election cycle, many progressives are calling for an increased commitment to media literacy programs. Others are clamoring for solutions that focus on expert fact-checking and labeling. Both of these approaches are likely to fail — not because they are bad ideas, but because they fail to take into consideration the cultural context of information consumption that we’ve created over the last thirty years. The problem on our hands is a lot bigger than most folks appreciate. What Are Your Sources? I remember a casual conversation that I had with a teen girl in the midwest while I was doing research. I knew her school approached sex ed through an abstinence-only education approach, but I don’t remember how the topic of pregnancy came up. What I do remember is her telling me that she and her friends talked a lot about pregnancy and “diseases” she could get through sex. As I probed further, she matter-of-factly explained a variety of “facts” she had heard that were completely inaccurate. You couldn’t get pregnant until you were 16. AIDS spreads through kissing. Etc. I asked her if she’d talked to her doctor about any of this, and she looked me as though I had horns. She explained that she and her friends had done the research themselves, by which she meant that they’d identified websites online that “proved” their beliefs. For years, that casual conversation has stuck with me as one of the reasons that we needed better Internet-based media literacy. As I detailed in my book It’s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens, too many students I met were being told that Wikipedia was untrustworthy and were, instead, being encouraged to do research. As a result, the message that many had taken home was to turn to Google and use whatever came up first. They heard that Google was trustworthy and Wikipedia was not. Understanding what sources to trust is a basic tenet of media literacy education. When educators encourage students to focus on sourcing quality information, they encourage them to critically ask who is publishing the content. Is the venue a respected outlet? What biases might the author have? The underlying assumption in all of this is that there’s universal agreement that major news outlets like the New York Times, scientific journal publications, and experts with advanced degrees are all highly trustworthy. Think about how this might play out in communities where the “liberal media” is viewed with disdain as an untrustworthy source of information…or in those where science is seen as contradicting the knowledge of religious people…or where degrees are viewed as a weapon of the elite to justify oppression of working people. Needless to say, not everyone agrees on what makes a trusted source. Students are also encouraged to reflect on economic and political incentives that might bias reporting. Follow the money, they are told. Now watch what happens when they are given a list of names of major power players in the East Coast news media whose names are all clearly Jewish. Welcome to an opening for anti-Semitic ideology. Empowered Individuals…with Guns We’ve been telling young people that they are the smartest snowflakes in the world. From the self-esteem movement in the 1980s to the normative logic of contemporary parenting, young people are told that they are lovable and capable and that they should trust their gut to make wise decisions. This sets them up for another great American ideal: personal responsibility. In the United States, we believe that worthy people lift themselves up by their bootstraps. This is our idea of freedom. What it means in practice is that every individual is supposed to understand finance so well that they can effectively manage their own retirement funds. And every individual is expected to understand their health risks well enough to make their own decisions about insurance. To take away the power of individuals to control their own destiny is viewed as anti-American by so much of this country. You are your own master. Children are indoctrinated into this cultural logic early, even as their parents restrict their mobility and limit their access to social situations. But when it comes to information, they are taught that they are the sole proprietors of knowledge. All they have to do is “do the research” for themselves and they will know better than anyone what is real. Combine this with a deep distrust of media sources. If the media is reporting on something, and you don’t trust the media, then it is your responsibility to question their authority, to doubt the information you are being given. If they expend tremendous effort bringing on “experts” to argue that something is false, there must be something there to investigate. Now think about what this means for #Pizzagate. Across this country, major news outlets went to great effort to challenge conspiracy reports that linked John Podesta and Hillary Clinton to a child trafficking ring supposedly run out of a pizza shop in Washington, DC. Most people never heard the conspiracy stories, but their ears perked up when the mainstream press went nuts trying to debunk these stories. For many people who distrust “liberal” media and were already primed not to trust Clinton, the abundant reporting suggested that there was something to investigate. Most people who showed up to the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria to see for their own eyes went undetected. But then a guy with a gun decided he “wanted to do some good” and “rescue the children.” He was the first to admit that “the intel wasn’t 100%,” but what he was doing was something that we’ve taught people to do — question the information they’re receiving and find out the truth for themselves. Experience Over Expertise Many marginalized groups are justifiably angry about the ways in which their stories have been dismissed by mainstream media for decades. This is most acutely felt in communities of color. And this isn’t just about the past. It took five days for major news outlets to cover Ferguson. It took months and a lot of celebrities for journalists to start discussing the Dakota Pipeline. But feeling marginalized from news media isn’t just about people of color. For many Americans who have watched their local newspaper disappear, major urban news reporting appears disconnected from reality. The issues and topics that they feel affect their lives are often ignored. For decades, civil rights leaders have been arguing for the importance of respecting experience over expertise, highlighting the need to hear the voices of people of color who are so often ignored by experts. This message has taken hold more broadly, particularly among lower and middle class whites who feel as though they are ignored by the establishment. Whites also want their experiences to be recognized, and they too have been pushing for the need to understand and respect the experiences of “the common man.” They see “liberal” “urban” “coastal” news outlets as antithetical to their interests because they quote from experts, use cleaned-up pundits to debate issues, and turn everyday people (e.g., “red sweater guy”) into spectacles for mass enjoyment. Consider what’s happening in medicine. Many people used to have a family doctor whom they knew for decades and trusted as individuals even more than as experts. Today, many people see doctors as arrogant and condescending, overly expensive and inattentive to their needs. Doctors lack the time to spend more than a few minutes with patients, and many people doubt that the treatment they’re getting is in their best interest. People feel duped into paying obscene costs for procedures that they don’t understand. Many economists can’t understand why so many people would be against the Affordable Care Act because they don’t recognize that this “socialized” medicine is perceived as experts over experience by people who don’t trust politicians who tell them what’s in their best interest any more than they trust doctors. And public trust in doctors is declining sharply. Why should we be surprised that most people are getting medical information from their personal social network and the Internet? It’s a lot cheaper than seeing a doctor, and both friends and strangers on the Internet are willing to listen, empathize, and compare notes. Why trust experts when you have at your fingertips a crowd of knowledgeable people who may have had the same experience as you and can help you out? Consider this dynamic in light of discussions around autism and vaccinations. First, an expert-produced journal article was published linking autism to vaccinations. This resonated with many parents’ experience. Then, other experts debunked the first report, challenged the motivations of the researcher, and engaged in a mainstream media campaign to “prove” that there was no link. What unfolded felt like a war on experience, and a network of parents coordinated to counter this new batch of experts who were widely seen as ignorant, moneyed, and condescending. The more that the media focused on waving away these networks of parents through scientific language, the more the public felt sympathetic to the arguments being made by anti-vaxxers. Keep in mind that anti-vaxxers aren’t arguing that vaccinations definitively cause autism. They are arguing that we don’t know. They are arguing that experts are forcing children to be vaccinated against their will, which sounds like oppression. What they want is choice — the choice to not vaccinate. And they want information about the risks of vaccination, which they feel are not being given to them. In essence, they are doing what we taught them to do: questioning information sources and raising doubts about the incentives of those who are pushing a single message. Doubt has become tool. Grappling with “Fake News” Since the election, everyone has been obsessed with fake news, as experts blame “stupid” people for not understanding what is “real.” The solutionism around this has been condescending at best. More experts are needed to label fake content. More media literacy is needed to teach people how not to be duped. And if we just push Facebook to curb the spread of fake news, all will be solved. I can’t help but laugh at the irony of folks screaming up and down about fake news and pointing to the story about how the Pope backs Trump. The reason so many progressives know this story is because it was spread wildly among liberal circles who were citing it as appalling and fake. From what I can gather, it seems as though liberals were far more likely to spread this story than conservatives. What more could you want if you ran a fake news site whose goal was to make money by getting people to spread misinformation? Getting doubters to click on clickbait is far more profitable than getting believers because they’re far more likely to spread the content in an effort to dispel the content. Win! CC BY 2.0-licensed photo by Denis Dervisevic. People believe in information that confirms their priors. In fact, if you present them with data that contradicts their beliefs, they will double down on their beliefs rather than integrate the new knowledge into their understanding. This is why first impressions matter. It’s also why asking Facebook to show content that contradicts people’s views will not only increase their hatred of Facebook but increase polarization among the network. And it’s precisely why so many liberals spread “fake news” stories in ways that reinforce their belief that Trump supporters are stupid and backwards. Labeling the Pope story as fake wouldn’t have stopped people from believing that story if they were conditioned to believe it. Let’s not forget that the public may find Facebook valuable, but it doesn’t necessarily trust the company. So their “expertise” doesn’t mean squat to most people. Of course, it would be an interesting experiment to run; I do wonder how many liberals wouldn’t have forwarded it along if it had been clearly identified as fake. Would they have not felt the need to warn everyone in their network that conservatives were insane? Would they have not helped fuel a money-making fake news machine? Maybe. But I think labeling would reinforce polarization — but it would feel like something was done. Nonbelievers would use the label to reinforce their view that the information is fake (and minimize the spread, which is probably a good thing), while believers would simply ignore the label. But does that really get us to where we want to go? Addressing so-called fake news is going to require a lot more than labeling. It’s going to require a cultural change about how we make sense of information, whom we trust, and how we understand our own role in grappling with information. Quick and easy solutions may make the controversy go away, but they won’t address the underlying problems. What Is Truth? As a huge proponent for media literacy for over a decade, I’m struggling with the ways in which I missed the mark. The reality is that my assumptions and beliefs do not align with most Americans. Because of my privilege as a scholar, I get to see how expert knowledge and information is produced and have a deep respect for the strengths and limitations of scientific inquiry. Surrounded by journalists and people working to distribute information, I get to see how incentives shape information production and dissemination and the fault lines of that process. I believe that information intermediaries are important, that honed expertise matters, and that no one can ever be fully informed. As a result, I have long believed that we have to outsource certain matters and to trust others to do right by us as individuals and society as a whole. This is what it means to live in a democracy, but, more importantly, it’s what it means to live in a society. In the United States, we’re moving towards tribalism, and we’re undoing the social fabric of our country through polarization, distrust, and self-segregation. And whether we like it or not, our culture of doubt and critique, experience over expertise, and personal responsibility is pushing us further down this path. Media literacy asks people to raise questions and be wary of information that they’re receiving. People are. Unfortunately, that’s exactly why we’re talking past one another. The path forward is hazy. We need to enable people to hear different perspectives and make sense of a very complicated — and in many ways, overwhelming — information landscape. We cannot fall back on standard educational approaches because the societal context has shifted. We also cannot simply assume that information intermediaries can fix the problem for us, whether they be traditional news media or social media. We need to get creative and build the social infrastructure necessary for people to meaningfully and substantively engage across existing structural lines. This won’t be easy or quick, but if we want to address issues like propaganda, hate speech, fake news, and biased content, we need to focus on the underlying issues at play. No simple band-aid will work. Special thanks to Amanda Lenhart, Claire Fontaine, Mary Madden, and Monica Bulger for their feedback!

Crunch Network On bots, language and making technology disappear Posted Jan 7, 2017 by Elizabeth McGuane 0 SHARES Next Story Talking tech with NBA legends Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley Elizabeth McGuane Crunch Network Contributor Elizabeth McGuane is lead content designer at Intercom. How to join the network There’s a new buzzword in computer design circles every year. This year, the buzzword is without question bots. As with anything we build, we give bots names. It’s something most of us don’t even question. They come pre-personified and ready for us to start that human-computer relationship, just like HAL 9000 or Her: there’s Siri in our iPhones, Alexa in Amazon’s Echo and there’s even Facebook Messenger’s PSL (Pumpkin Spice Latte) Bot. A name can be a way of expressing trust in an object — or expressing control over it. In design terms, a name is a kind of affordance — a handle we can hold onto. As the resident language expert on our product design team, naming things is part of my job. When we began iterating on a bot within our messaging product, I was prepared to brainstorm hundreds of names. Gendered, non-gendered, functional, etc. But first, we did some testing with actual end users to understand their relationship with bots, language and names. We learned that giving a bot an identity isn’t always for the best. Calling a bot Siri does not necessarily have the same relationship-building effect as calling your car Bessie or Old Faithful. Talking and typing are two different things In a voice-activated bot, names are pretty functional: saying “Siri,” “Alexa” or “OK Google” is the conversational equivalent of opening Google and entering a search term.  When you see a search bar, your brain leaps from idea — there’s something I want to find — to action. We do this so often — more than 40,000 times a second — that we don’t think of it as conversing with the system, though we are asking a question and expecting a response. But names don’t trigger an action in text-based bots, or chatbots. Even Slackbot, the tool built into the popular work messaging platform Slack, doesn’t need you to type “Hey Slackbot” in order to retrieve a pre-programmed response. Speaking our searches out loud serves a function, but it also draws our attention to the interaction. This can have both good and bad effects. Voice is fundamentally more “humanizing” than text. A study released in August showed that when we hear something versus when we read the same thing, we are more likely to attribute the spoken word to a human “creator.” The real measure of success for today’s designers is making technology disappear. But what is humanizing can also be irritating. We may find it far more exhausting, as humans, to say “OK Google” 75 times a day than to silently open a laptop and search. From a design perspective, bots are aligned with the whole concept of messaging-as-a-platform — we could build a bot right into our own messenger using the same simple elements we’d already designed for human-to-human conversation. So when we experimented with building a bot, we wanted to use those simple elements to communicate. We gave our test bot a name and let it introduce itself like a real person would: “Hi, I’m Bot, Intercom’s digital assistant.” What we found was surprising. People hated this bot — found it off-putting and annoying. It was interrupting them, getting in the way of what they wanted (to talk to a real person), even though its interactions were very lightweight. We tried different things: alternate voices, so that the bot was sometimes friendly and sometimes reserved and functional. But we didn’t see much change. It was only when we removed the name and took away the first person pronoun and the introduction that things started to improve. The name, more than any other factor, caused friction. Who holds the handle? We’ve been telling ourselves scary stories about robots for more than a century, stories in which we simultaneously pity and mistrust them. When we name the tools we use, we assert control over them; we do that because we want to be the ones having the interaction, doing the job. The digital tools we make live in a completely different psychological landscape to the real world. We can’t get a handle on them, literally. There is no straight line from a tradesman’s hammer he can repair himself to a chatbot designed and built by a design team somewhere in California (or in Dublin, in our case). Unlike most writers in my company, my work does its job best when it’s barely noticed. Control is incredibly important in designing digital tools — most language we see and experience in a product is about affording control and understanding to you, the person using the product — not me, the writer. To be understood intuitively is the goal — the words on the screen are the handle of the hammer. Names and identity lift the tools on the screen to a level above intuition. They make us see the tool in all its virtual glory, and place it in an entirely different context to the person using it — and not always a relationship that person asks for or appreciates. Related Articles Emotibot wants to help chatbots know how you really feel People feel weird about touching robot butts, researchers find Google could be selling Boston Dynamics because even Google thinks these robots are terrifying This might be because of novelty — we might become more comfortable with the virtual, more trusting of it (though this year’s headlines haven’t given us much to trust). But despite the hundreds of movies we’ve made and books we’ve written about robots, introducing personality into technology might not be the way we become more comfortable. There’s another school of thought in design, one that describes it as almost invisible. Siri and Alexa might have been thought of as examples of this type: you can’t really “see” them, and so they disappear into the background. But that’s not necessarily true. As humans, we’re visual people — we respond to what we see. But even more than that, we’re social — we respond to the things we can speak to. It’s why we name our possessions, and why we fear the pretend humans we’ve been imagining for so long. The real measure of success for today’s designers is making technology disappear so that it becomes a true tool for humans. The true measure of success for a designer who deals in words is making tools quieter to use, so we can use them more intuitively.

Amazon’s AI assistant was everywhere at this year’s CES, from phones and cars to robots and refrigerators. But that wasn’t the only big theme at the world’s biggest tech trade show. The team at Tom’s Guide met with more than 200 companies to arrive at this list of the best and most exciting new products. Our picks include a TV that’s so thin you can almost floss with it, a breakthrough that charges your phone across the room, an AI-powered concept car and a 4K streaming box that puts Apple TV to shame. And it has Google Assistant inside. Take that, Alexa. Best of Show: LG Signature OLED TV W Picture 2 of 25 There’s a reason LG nicknamed this TV “wallpaper.” At just about a tenth of an inch thick, the gorgeous W7 OLED set blends so seamlessly into its surroundings, you wonder how it works at all. Available in 65- and 77-inches, we were also blown away by the W7’s stunning picture quality, as well as the audio from its equally impressive Dolby Atmos soundbar, whose upfiring speakers raise and lower with the push of a button on the remote. Because why not! MORE: LG W7 Hands-on Best Virtual Reality: Project Alloy Picture 3 of 25 Intel’s Project Alloy is a VR experience unlike any other. The standalone headset uses four RealSense cameras to scan a room and implement its furniture and walls into the game you’re playing. It also includes an entire computer in the headset, including CPU and battery, which lets you play without being tethered to a computer. The result is an interactive experience that had us ducking behind a table as we waged war with robot enemies. We can’t wait to see what happens when Intel’s partners include the technology in headsets that should appear later this year. MORE: Project Alloy Hands-On Best Innovation: Ossia Cota Tile Picture 4 of 25 Forget about all the so-called "wireless charging" technologies you've seen before. A game-changing breakthrough, Ossia's Cota Tile lives in the ceiling and sends electricity through the air to your device just like a router sends out a Wi-Fi signal. Your phone can charge all day while it sits in your pocket and your smart home devices can get juiced constantly, even if they're nowhere near an outlet. MORE: Ossia Cota Tile Hands-on Editor's Choice: Lego Boost Picture 5 of 25 To succeed in the 21st century job market, today's kids need to learn how to code when they're young. The Lego Boost kit teaches basic programming concepts to children as young as seven as they build any of five really cute robots and control them with a tablet app. Since this is Lego, you can customize these robots with standard bricks too. MORE: Lego Boost Hands-on Best Car Tech: Toyota Concept-i Picture 6 of 25 It will greet you with a wink when you walk up to it, play calming tunes to soothe your mind in difficult times, and it will even let you drive when you want. Toyota's Concept-i isn't just a self-driving car, it's a friend on wheels. Oh, and it looks amazing, too. With the way the Concept-i implements AI, Toyota has elevated what a car can be, and if this is a vision of the kind of tech that's coming down the road, it can't get here soon enough. MORE: Toyota Concept-i Hands-on Best Robot: Ubtech Lynx Picture 7 of 25 The Lynx from Ubtech is a robot like no other. That’s because it’s the first humanoid with Alexa inside. Ask Lynx a question or give it a command, and it will turn it’s head towards you. Don’t be creeped out, because this is a robot with a heart. And a lot of dexterity. The Lynx can execute crazy Yoga poses, dance and even hug your child while you’re on a video call with him from half-way around the world. MORE: Ubtech Lynx Hands-on Best Phone: Asus ZenFone AR Picture 8 of 25 The Asus ZenFone AR is a phone that stands out. It’s the first Android handset to run both the Google Tango augmented reality platform and Daydream VR, and it doesn’t skimp on specs, either. The ZenFone AR is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 CPU, 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Adreno 530 GPU. It also packs a 5.7-inch 2560 x 1440 AMOLED display that will look great when using apps or the Google Daydream VR headset. MORE: Asus ZenFone AR Hands-On Best Budget Phone: Honor 6X Picture 9 of 25 The Honor 6X is the kind of phone that makes you wonder why you pay several hundred bucks for a flagship device. This $249 device packs a dual-lens rear camera (for achieving the iPhone 7 Plus’ portrait mode effect on the cheap) and a fingerprint sensor while boasting all-day battery life. Actually, make that two days, at least when you’re not using it heavily. The 6X is proof that you don’t need to bust your budget just to enjoy some of the finer features smartphones have to offer. MORE: Honor 6X Hands-on Best Smart Home Product: LG Instaview Refrigerator Picture 10 of 25 This Alexa-enabled fridge has a 29-inch touchscreen that runs not just Windows 10, but webOS, too. Among other things, you can check the weather, play music, and leave notes for your family. Cameras inside the LG Instaview refrigerator send photos to your smartphone to let you see if you’re running low on eggs, or you can simply tap the display, and it will turn clear. This lets you look inside without ever having to open the door. MORE: LG Instaview Hands-on Best Design: Dell Canvas 27 Picture 11 of 25 It has a screen that folds down, a pen, and a dial that you can use to select tools and change colors on the fly. No, it’s not the Surface Studio. Dell’s Canvas 27 gives creative professionals a fantastically versatile workspace for a fraction of the price. This display plugs into any existing Windows 10 PC and offers a new interface (in partnership with Stardock) that will make you feel Minority Report-powerful. MORE: Dell Canvas 27 Hands-on Best Laptop: Acer Predator 21X Picture 12 of 25 The Predator 21X is what happens when you throw caution (and budgets) to the wind. This head-turning beast of a gaming laptop sports a curved 21-inch display, which is a first for any laptop. There’s also a mechanical keyboard on board, dual Nvidia 1080 graphics cards and a very nifty magnetic touchpad that you can flip over that turns into a number pad. Sure, this brute costs $9,000, but if you have the means, why the hell not?

That's because this desktop packs a whopping 10-speaker soundbar right below its display, allowing you to hear your music, movies and shows the way they were meant to sound. Factor in a 27-inch 4K touch display that can be laid flat, and you've got a spectacular all-in-one for artists, musicians or simply anyone who wants their content to both look and sound fantastic.

With the Bravia XBR-A1E, Sony devised a novel solution: turn the screen itself into a speaker. The Bravia XBR-A1E boasts a gorgeous 4K HDR OLED screen, but what really sets it apart is that the screen itself vibrates to produce sound. Not only are there no speakers required, but its novel Acoustic Surface technology should sound even better than most tiny flat screen TV speakers.

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile CEO John Legere makes his predictions for 2017 T-Mobile CEO John Legere makes his predictions for 2017 January 6, 2017 Alex Wagner 40 Comments It’s the start of a new year, and just like he has the past couple of years, T-Mobile CEO John Legere has laid out his predictions for the coming 12 months. Legere’s first prediction for 2017 is that cable companies will try to enter wireless through MVNO deals, but that they’ll fail. Legere adds that because of this, T-Mobile will not get into any MVNO deals with cable companies. Cable companies are the only ones that’ll try to get into wireless in 2017, Legere suggests, as he thinks that “a MAJOR new player will jump in and shake up US wireless in a MAJOR way.” The T-Mo CEO specifically guesses that Google will “go for the mobile moonshot.” Google offers wireless service through Project Fi, which runs on the T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular networks, but Legere appears to think that Google will take things a step farther in 2017. Sticking with the topic of other companies, Legere thinks that Dish will be no more this year after it missed its opportunity to enter wireless using its supply of spectrum. Moving on to television shows, Legere predicts that the majority of TV watching will happen on mobile by the end of 2017. More than one-third of TV viewing happens on something other than a TV, Legere says, with that number jumping to 50 percent for people under 25. And T-Mo’s CEO expects those numbers to continue to grow. The second TV-related prediction from Legere is that content built for OTT and mobile consumption, like his Slow Cooker Sunday show, will pass cable channels in number of viewers. Specifically, Legere thinks that his Slow Cooker Sunday show will get a weekly audience of 1 million viewers by the end of 2017. The show currently pulls in more than 500,000 viewers each week. Rounding out John’s 2017 predictions are gigabit LTE speeds, which T-Mobile touts that it’s nearly achieved in lab testing; a wireless CEO shuffle that’ll see three of the four current CEOs exiting their positions this year; and merger discussions between Verizon and Comcast as a way to help Comcast get into wireless. While John didn’t make any specific predictions about T-Mobile’s network, it seems likely that T-Mo will continue to build out its LTE coverage in 2017. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said yesterday that T-Mo plans to cover 320 million POPs with LTE in 2017, up from the 313 million covered at the end of 2016. Ray also said that T-Mobile currently reaches 251 million people with its Extended Range LTE coverage and that that number will grow in the first half of 2017. So what do you think of all these predictions? Do you have any that you’d like to add?

View all posts by Alex Wagner → ← T-Mobile CEO John Legere talks Sprint, possibility of merger Next week’s T-Mobile Tuesday includes $2 movie ticket, grand prize trip to Sundance Film Festival → Josh Schoonover It still amazes me just how rapidly they’ve expanded the network in just a few short years. The prospect of that being the year end coverage map is so very exciting! Mark Kendrick I’m amazed myself by the improvement in their network in just the last year. I tried TMO last year for a couple of months but bailed because the service wasn’t very good, a year later and I’m quite satisfied Edward Ward Over the past year I have seen my coverage improve tremendously, to the point where I now have coverage on par with my wife who is Verizon loyal. Jason Caprio Those are some nice coverage predictions. I’ll believe it when I see it. I hope to see the day when T-Mobile ties/beats Verizon in rootmetrics, then I’ll switch back! I’m rooting for T-Mobile all the way! Cellphone Chris The cable MVNO thing isn’t a prediction, it’s already been announced. Those that know what I’m talking about understand that a merger between Verizon and Comcast seems highly unlikely. a d00d With Republicans in control of all 3 houses (Capitol Hill House, Senate, and White House), this merger is very much a possibility. In fact, depending on how fast they change things, I could even call it certain. Evil attracts Evil, after all. And I wonder how many board members are shared? Of course, we’ll all suffer for it, along with a TMo merger, but that’s the way it goes. At least we should be rid of Obamacare… Acdc1a We have no idea what is to come. A Republican wasn’t elected President, a populist was. If popular opinion is against the idea, it doesn’t go through. If it’s well sold to the public, it will. Linx I can’t see myself on any other carrier than T-Mobile right now. Richard Roma That’s interesting, I’m on the opposite end where I feel like evaluating other options. I don’t like this One only push at all. Jay Holm This coming April I will have been with T-Mobile for 4 full years. Very happy customer. Walt Get ride of the 3G hspa and use that spectrum for LTE. Keep 2G edge for all the flip phones and m2m Andrew Singleton keeping any 2g is a horrible idea. tmo’s new flip phone is LTE. a d00d Andrew, you need to re-read about IoT in the article earlier in the week. Walt, the problem is that many of the IoT resellers have been nudging these guys onto 3G as a cheaper measure than going directly to LTE as most companies only think of the short haul (bottom line for this quarter or year only) versus the long haul (let someone else pay for it). Plus there are a huge number of 3G handsets still in use, especially from other, poorer countries or rural carriers in this one who refuse to upgrade, likely because they can’t afford it. 2G will be with us a few more years, and 3G probably until the mid 2020’s at the earliest. Then again, with some of the fancy on-the-fly spectrum shuffling these new software-defined radio systems can do, it has been pointed out by others that, at least in an advanced network like TMo’s, they may NEVER go away completely! Nobody Special I predict after January 22nd @ The deadline for simple choice subscribers to switch to t-mobile one and get the tax included deal …. t-mobile will come up with a new incentive to trick the remaining simple choice subscribers to come to the darkside “T-Mobile One”…. the saga continues. nearvanaman I sort of rolled my eyes at T-Mo One because I typically use 1.5 to 3.0 gigs a month. But my 6GB plan, with taxes, costs me $75 a month. This “new” T-Mo One incentive will cost me a maximum of $70 and, sometimes, $60. I know the point is to get people on to the One plan and it’s hard to see a downside of doing this if they are never going to offer tiered plans again. Acdc1a For you it’s a no-brainer. I have 5 lines on ONE and Leger is right, it’s nice not to try to count GB. AJ2 What Tmo has failed to realize with the Tmo One plans is that most people still use 2gb or less. The $10 ‘back’ is a nice marekting ploy that I guess will make the plan a $60. If you use a Nexus or Pixel, Project Fi would still be cheaper. I see all these ads for $40 a line but thats only if you buy 4 lines. If they’d offer something for single customers, Id give Tmobile a try again as its the only one of the big 4 Ive ever had before switching to MVNOs. I dont care about a free Subway sandwich or some coupon to a product Idont want. If you can give a family of 4 free lines, you surely can do a promotion to offer single people a break Jay Holm If all people use is 2GB’s or less, what is the point in have a $500-$700+ smartphone? That’s like having a $20k car and driving lessons than 20 miles total per day, if I go no where but to work and back home that would be nearly 26 miles total in one day. I just don’t understand what the purpose is having a $500-$700 device and only use a measly 2gigs in a 30 day period. John Doe I don’t think Dish will end in 2017. They have Sling TV and Charlie Ergen isn’t a stupid guy so maybe I doubt it will disappear in 2017 that is too soon. I think John hopes that Dish will disappear so he can get his hands on their spectrum LoL (Oh that is right they have spectrum they can sell if things get bad for Dish) a d00d I don’t know if it was a mis-quote or not as I didn’t watch the video or whatever, but I think he meant Dish as a potential wireless competitor. The FCC has repeatedly warned them that they have never complied with their rules regarding build-out time after purchasing spectrum. That is, Dish is a Spectrum Squatter, the wireless version of a Domain Squatter, and, even under a new right-wing admin, I think the FCC may have finally had enough. Consider they let Globalstar use their little block of spectrum for limited terrestrial use after they’ve been begging for years. OTOH, Ergen has been squatting on a boat-load of spectrum with no network for years despite FCC pressure to sell or build. I for one truly hope that the FCC finally drops the hammer. QWR At CES, Legere actually said something to the effect that delivery of satellite-based content is dead, and so Dish will be dead as well. IMO he was not talking about Dish as a wireless provider. As far as the FCC goes, they have very little interest in going after Ergen for squatting since they turned him down for buying anyone on the cheap in 2015. He attempted to put it to use, and has until sometime this year to sell or lease 50% of his spectrum, even though it’s transmission properties are more suited for large amounts of data vs. speed. BadBatz 1. How about “predicting” some bonuses, freebies, incentives, etc. for long time subscribers to T-Mobile… The siren song of AT&T is calling… And Project Fi is taking already a lot of my business away from T-Mob… 2. Bandwidth… Need more bandwidth… How about more bandwidth… No more bandwidth, no more wireless watching of anything, Mr. Legere. And rural coverage… 3. Please, Mr. Legere, “predict” better international coverage for “free data roaming” and 20 cent voice calls. Some initiatives notwithstanding (Europe higher speed data for example) international roaming has become a sad joke: data throttled to the point of being unusable (64 kbps in may places), inability to dial out to many countries whilst roaming, etc. Even the T-Mobile app no workee in may places… Please “predict” improvements or just “predict” going back to the sate of int’l roaming from 2015… marque2 Project To always seemed really expensive to me. $10 per gig, wow. AJ2 Id switch to Tmobile if it had a less expensive plan for single customers, especially people that dont use 10-20 gb of data. Left Tmo years ago – First went to Straight Talk for their $45 5gb LTE plan and now on Fi where my bills are tiny. If Im not mistaken, with their new $10 rebate, the lowest plan is $60 if you use less than 2gb. Even getting paid $150 to switch doesnt make it worth it. Expert go with tmobile prepaid BadBatz If you don’t use gobs of data stay with Fi. For email, news, maps/navigation, etc. my total monthly bill is seldom over $30. Fi prefers T-Mobile anyway, even whilst roaming abroad the US endpoint is a T-Mobile IP in Texas, but connects to other networks stateside if T-Mobile is not available. Besides, laptop tethering doesn’t cost extra, roaming data is at full speed and it roams in some countries where T-Mobile does not. And Fi forwards calls AND text messages – the latter priceless if you use multiple phones. I have no idea what will become of Project Fi but for now I’m happy to have “Google talk” in my pocket :-) marque2 T-Mobile offered full speed tethering with its older plans. And I believe low speed tethering is included in Europe. Europe is way behind going to LTE, so high speed is also.lst impossible anyway. Jay Holm Since you use “so little data”, why even have a smartphone? Seriously! What a waste of money for someone who doesn’t even use their smartphone! marque2 Agreed, he can get a flip phone and 350 minutes of monthly service for $9 a month. Aleks I always knew that Google would enter the fray with a wireless service of their own. For John Legere to make this prediction, tells me that Google and T-Mobile could be looking at a merger, which to me, is the whole purpose of Google entering the wireless business sector. It’s been discussed behind closed doors. If this indeed does happen, look for wireless to be much cheaper and faster as Google is known to keep things affordable for the masses. Don’t take my word for it but if you’re on a legacy T-Mobile plan right now and ggrandfathered in, consider yourself lucky as they will be a major player in the wireless industry for the foreseeable future. I’m looking at Google and T-Mobile to work together and pave the way for the future. But like I said, don’t take my word for it. Just see it happening from a business standpoint. marque2 Google is evil. It will be a sad day when they take over TM. Nearmsp I would like to know what percentage of interstate freeways and state highways are covered rather than the million population. We just do not talk when we are in population centers. We talk while get from point A to point B and we could travel through places with no population on the way out of one city to another. This is the reason why people go for AT&T and Verizon. Coverage outside of major cities should be a goal of T-mobile. Currently I carry a a Verizon myfi and switch on as soon as leave the metro area to be able to do wi-fi calling. T-mobile coverage outside cities still sucks. It has improved much but a long way to go. KeepU You don’t happen to do much of that rural driving in West Virginia or between I-35 and I-5 do you? I drive a truck, and those are the only places I find a big difference in coverage between my t-mobile and verizon coverage. marque2 He doesn’t do much rural driving in his apparent state of Texas. Or never uses the phone while driving. Jay Holm I’ve driven from Houston to Laredo, from Houston to Dallas, from Houston to Longview. . .never lost signal in between any of these places. marque2 Try Midland to El Paso. No coverage for 200 miles when I last drove it. Try driving I-40 in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. I have a fairly new 5x as well. Parts of I15 in CA. Shouldn’t have problems with the new bands. And once the interstates are covered major highways should be next 395 and 78 “Ortega highway” comes to mind. I know TM is small and is trying hard to cover more, bit to claim no issues while travelling is false. Also note San Diego has major holes in Oceanside, Carlsbad, parts of Coronado and San Diego bay. They haven’t put Band 12 in San Diego yet. KeepU I predict the low grade billing fraud will continue, as will the network build out, and despite it’s serious flaws T-mobile will continue to be the least bad of the major wireless providers. QWR Nice hat. Did you get a free bowl of soup with it? And Dish would like to officially declare that you cut your hair this year. Steven Prediction, T-Mobile will continue to ignore the Alabama and Florida Gulf Coast by not issuing the much needed Extended Range LTE.

Well not all the time, but some of us set goals for the New Year and just forget them. For example lose weight or exercise more often. So, Google is here to help you with that if you are using the Goals feature from the Google Calendar. Google announced on Thursday that you can connect Google Fit and Apple Health to your fitness goals in Calendar. “When you do, activity in your favorite fitness apps will be recorded and used to mark your goals in Google Calendar as ‘done’ automatically,” reads a blog post. Now, before this new feature you had to mark your goal as completed in Google Calendar. The company brought Goals last year with the promise to help you manage your busy schedule in order to achieve goals like working out, reading more books or learning a new language. Google believes that postponing a task or a goal is very easy to happen to all of us. But, Google Goals will help you find the time and stick to it. And according to them it is very easy to set a goal. You just have to answer a few questions (such as “How often?” and “Best time?”), and you are ready to start! From there Calendar will look at your schedule and find the best windows to add your personal goals.   Source: https://blog.google/products/calendar/track-your-new-years-fitness-goals-with-google-calendar/ Another feature you will get with Goals is rescheduling. For example, Calendar will automatically reschedule if you add another event that’s a direct conflict with a goal. You can also defer a goal at any time, and Calendar will make time for it later. Finally, Google Calendar can actually gets better and at scheduling the more you use it. You just need to defer, edit or complete your goals like normal, and Calendar will choose even better times in the future. Google seems to be very proud about Calendar and they chose the best way to celebrate its 10th anniversary. And they are more than willing to make more updates like Goals, and help us find more time for ourselves and our family – from your daily must-dos, to exercising more, to just a little “me time.” Download Google Calendar at the Play Store or App Store Share the joy                 Share this: Reddit Email Facebook Skype Twitter Tumblr Google LinkedIn More Pinterest Author: Martha Papadimitriou Martha is a journalist, a blog writer, a mother and a bookworm.

In the Google realm, that means we’ve seen plenty of new Android phones, Chromebooks, wearables, and more. But CES is always a matter of finding the diamonds in the rough. There are always some impressive announcements, but the vast majority of things we’ve seen this week have been either mundane or old news. That’s why we’ve done the work for you. Follow after the break to get a peek at our picks for the best Android, Chrome and Google-related products that debuted at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show… Best Android Wear watch: New Balance RunIQ Our first award is for the best Android Wear watch of the show, and we were actually surprised to find that there were a couple new watches announced this week. The new Casio watch (which is definitely the runner-up in this category) builds on what that company launched last year, but our pick for the best Android Wear device of the show goes to the new New Balance RunIQ. It’s the first Android Wear watch made specifically for running, and it’s only the third or fourth Android Wear watch made for fitness (succeeding the Moto 360 Sport, the Sony SmartWatch 3, and the more recent Polar M600). As we mentioned in our hands-on, there’s nothing too special about the watch, but it does run Android Wear 2.0 and does just about everything that a fitness smartwatch should — it tracks heart rate, steps, speed, calories, distance, and more. It was definitely a close fight with Casio for this watch, but we were won over by the New Balance’s availability timeline (it’s going to hit store shelves early next month), value (it’s more affordable at $300), its running-specific features (never seen that in an Android Wear watch before!) and its generally refined take on what a fitness smartwatch powered by Android Wear should be. The demo at the Intel booth showing just how accurately the watch tracked fitness stats was also impressive. Best Android smartphone: ZenFone AR CES is always home to the launch of many an Android phone, and this year we saw a few notable launches. ZTE and LG hit the show floor with some budget options, Huawei launched the Mate 9 in the United States with Amazon Alexa, and Xiaomi showed off the white version of the Mi Mix made for outside the US. The one standout of the show for us, however, was the ASUS ZenFone AR. And ASUS’ other new phone, the ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom, was also a top contender. ASUS has made the Zenfone AR the first Android smartphone to hit the United States with an option for 8GB of RAM, and the phone packs the powerful Snapdragon 821, which isn’t the latest Qualcomm chip but definitely a great one. But for us at 9to5Google, the ZenFone AR stands out for one reason: it’s made to work with Google’s Tango AR platform. That platform is definitely still growing for now, as we’ve noted, but it has a lot of potential. We saw the Lenovo PHAB2 Pro in the summer and fall of last year, but that device was just too big — and frankly its software too horrendous — for us to wholeheartedly recommend it as a consumer product. This phone is different. It does Tango, it has a much more reasonable physical size, and its software is definitely closer to being a polished user experience. Oh, and it supports Daydream. Really, the only downside for us at this year’s CES is that we weren’t actually able to see the Tango features in action quite yet. Be did, however, get some really nice photos and video — so check that out. Best Chromebook: Samsung Chromebook Pro/Plus Chromebooks have felt like they’ve been on the backburner for the last year, but thankfully CES 2017 brought a few new Chromebooks for us to get our grubby (literally, CES isn’t the cleanest place in the world) hands on. Of those, we saw the ASUS Chromebook Flip 2 (an honorable mention!), but the star of the show was a pair of new Chromebooks from Samsung. Somewhat confusingly called the Chromebook Pro and the Chromebook Plus, the two laptops are identical apart from their processors. We picked these Chromebooks because they are the Chromebooks we’ve always wanted. As we said, they breathe new life into Chrome OS. All products have compromises, but these two sleek laptops from Samsung have the least compromises of any Chromebook ever. They have a solid build, the Pro has a very powerful processor (for a Chromebook), they touch screens that flip around to be used like a tablet, they sport USB-C ports (welcome to 2017!), they rock Android apps without a hitch, and they even have styluses. Really, the only compromise is probably going to be their price tags (the Plus is starting at $449, and the higher-end Pro is TBD), but I think we can forgive that for the purpose of this award — prices will surely fall over the coming year. Best Android TV: Nvidia Shield TV and Spot Android TV is another platform that was been largely ignored in 2016, so it’s good to see it get a little attention at CES this year. The OEM that gave it that attention was Nvidia, a company that is becoming known for more and more products that aren’t desktop graphics cards. And the product that this company launched this year is the latest Nvidia Shield TV, a little (seriously, it’s unexpectedly tiny) Android TV set-top box that can do a lot more than just play little games from the Play Store and Netflix. Here at 9to5Google we’re big fans of Google Assistant, so the Nvidia Shield TV being the first Android TV device to get Google’s new helper was a big reason we went with this device. For just $199 (pre-orders now open on Amazon!), the Shield supports streaming 4K HDR content from a variety of services like Amazon and Netflix, and there are even hundreds of console-quality games waiting for you on Shield store. Another big reason we went with this device, however, is the new $49 Shield Spot that launched alongside the Shield. It extends Google Assistant throughout your home with a tiny little device that you can just pop into an outlet.

One of these is the ability to input text when talking directly to the Assistant on the Google Pixel. Other changes include further work to get Assistant working on Android Wear plus something new called “Search gestures”… The biggest find is, of course, the ability to talk to the Google Assistant through written text. This would look and feel very similar to how you can communicate with the Assistant through Allo. Added to the application was a keyboard icon. Once this feature is launched, users might be able to tap it and the Assistant’s UI will change to include a text field for written input. While most people are fine having vocal conversations with their phones for now, this update would pave the way for the day that bots get fully integrated into the Google Assistant. Instead of having to direct orders only through voice, you’ll be able to communicate with all of those future services by simply typing a couple of instructions. In previous teardowns of the Android Wear application, code snippets were found that hinted to the fact that Google was working to bring the Assistant to Wear 2.0. New code in the Google app appears to now be corroborating this fact. For now, not much can be found other than some code that points to new settings for the Android Wear Assistant. Lastly, something called “Search gestures” has been found in the latest beta build. While nothing is confirmed at this point, the name does make it sound like you’ll be able to activate the Google search interface by swiping down on the home screen instead of reaching up and tapping on the search bar at the top of the screen. This could be useful on tablets or phones with larger displays. The app teardown, courtesy of the Android Police, suggests that these new features could be made available soon via a server-side or an entire app update. Just keep in mind that Google could always just scrap them before they ever see the light of day. You can download the Google beta 6.10 .apk file here if you would like to install it and test it on your own device.

Last year, Google released versions of Google Assistant on three different products - the Pixel smartphones, Google Allo, and Google Home. Until now, the only way to interact with the Assistant outside the Allo app has been to use voice, but that may soon change. In its teardown session of APK file for a new beta version of Google app for Android, Android Police discovered that the keyboard-based input could be coming to the Google Assistant for the Pixel and Pixel XL. Presently, you can only communicate with Google Assistant through voice on Pixel smartphones. When this keyboard input feature finally arrives, a keyboard icon will start showing up while you interact with Google Assistant, and tapping on it will allow you to type your query. However, it still remains to be seen if there would be a difference between the sort of replies you get from Google Assistant with and without the keyboard input, though we'd be surprised if there was any difference. The APK file teardown also revealed Assistant could add support for Android Wear, but it's still not clear if this would only be for wearables paired with Pixel smartphones, or a wider range of phones. In addition, there's another feature that has been discovered in the teardown. It's a bare mention of 'search gestures' in the APK file, which suggests Google might be testing some gesture input feature in the Pixel launcher or Google Now launcher. It's not clear when these features will ship to all users. This week at the CES trade show, Google said that Assistant will now be making its way to supported Android TV devices in the US. Google's artificial intelligence-based digital assistant will be released for Nvidia's new Shield, as well as other Android TVs running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher, which includes AirTV Player, Sharp Aquos, Sony Bravia, and Xiaomi Mi Box.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Pixel 2: What Google smartphones really need to mix it up with the competition Here are the top features Google Pixel 2 needs to succeed Sami Khan   January 7, 2017 19:57 IST Google PixelScreenshot from Google Play Store Google put an end to the Nexus-era last year by beginning the reign of its Pixel series. The Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones were lauded for their hardware, design and software, especially the deep AI integration. Read: Smartphones we simply cannot wait to see in 2017: iPhone 8, Samsung Galaxy X, OnePlus 4 Since Google has taken control of the manufacturing process of its Android smartphone line, there are a lot of expectations from the web giant. The new Pixel series did live up to the expectations of many, but the phones lacked some essentials to compete against the likes of Apple and Samsung. The year 2017 will be the year for many tech companies to launch their new flagships. Samsung, for instance, will begin the race with its Galaxy S8 around MWC 2017 next month, followed by several other OEMs such as LG, OnePlus and the rest. Apple will finally conclude the year on a high note with the most-anticipated launch of the iPhone 8 series. Amidst all this, Google will steal some limelight again this year with the successor of Pixel and Pixel XL, and there will be a lot of people waiting to see what Google brings to the table. First of all, Google will need to consider some serious upgrades to stay on par with its closest rivals in the premium smartphone race. Below are the upgrades worth considering for the Pixel 2.... Waterproofing is essential With Apple and Samsung offering water- and dust-proofing for their flagships, it is essential Google ups the ante this year with its Pixel 2 smartphones. The Pixel 2 is most likely to offer IPS67 certification, upgrading from IP58, which is only valid for splashes instead of a full dip. 2K display to match rivals Well, it was surprising to see Google offer a Full HD display on the Pixel while offering 2K resolution for its Pixel XL phone. We would like to see Google make 2K screens standard for the Pixel 2 regardless of the size as most companies are offering it in premium flagships, take Samsung Galaxy S7 series for example. Dual camera will iron out many pixels Samsung is still not offering a dual camera setup, but it is likely to bring its best game this year. Apple has already made an example of its iPhone 7 Plus. Now it is up to Google to match its rivals. We strongly hope the Pixel 2 will feature dual camera with advanced imaging capabilities like AR. VR gaming will be a thing in 2017 Thanks to Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, VR gaming on flagship phones will be a lot easier. Google has an advantage over its rivals with its Daydream View, which offers advanced VR capabilities. We hope to see a second-gen Daydream View headset launch alongside Pixel 2, along with some compatible games this year. Hardware bump To round it off, Google will need a stronger spec-sheet. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU, 6GB RAM (minimum) and a better optimised battery will certainly be a welcome move by Google.

The demand by Russian authorities to remove LinkedIn in Apple and Google app stores comes weeks after a court blocked the professional networking service for flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on Russian citizens within the nation's borders, The New York Times reports. The action puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens. When LinkedIn's website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly. Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple's App Store may not have cut off access to content, but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps. Direct blocking of websites has been done by China, Russia, Turkey and several other nations for years, usually through their state-run internet service providers. But civil rights groups say the pressure authoritarian governments are now placing on Apple and Google is a new wrinkle. "Apps are the new choke point of free expression," said Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America. Increasingly, United States tech companies are complying with those demands. In the early 2000s, American internet firms strongly pushed back on demands by China to comply with censorship rules within the country's internet controls, known as the Great Firewall. Recently, Facebook has been working on a censorship tool to be able to access China, where it is currently blocked along with Twitter and Google. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was "disappointed" with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service, which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores. "It denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses," said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. Apple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app, but declined to comment further on both events. Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates. More nations have enforced their own internet laws in recent years. Turkey intermittently blocks social media, such as during the attempted government coup last summer. It has also forced YouTube to remove content it considers disparaging of its modern-day founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. European nations have also drawn up their own privacy laws and in 2014 a court declared its citizens could demand internet companies like Google unlink information about users upon request. Tech companies and civil rights advocates warn that the increasing push by nations to create their own internet rules will Balkanize the internet and potentially lead to privacy violations and the stifling of political dissent. Other countries, however, criticize Silicon Valley and the United States government for setting the norms and rules for the internet. "Internet free speech and internet freedom are increasingly under attack all over the globe, and not just from authoritarian regimes," said Robert M. McDowell, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission and partner at Cooley law firm. "It appears to be a one-way ratchet with speech control getting tighter." LinkedIn has several million users in Russia, it said. In November, a Russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on Russian accounts within the nation. Most American internet companies in Russia operate in violation of the law, but without explanation, Russian regulators at a body known as Roskomnadzor took the rare step of enforcing its rules. The Russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment. The action came at a tense moment in Russian-United States relations related to cyber affairs. Russia has been accused of hacking into American accounts, including the Democratic National Committee, to try to influence the presidential election. American intelligence officials concluded in a declassified report released on Friday that the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered the campaign.

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

On Friday, District Court Judge Helen Syme sentenced the 28-year-old to a maximum of three years and six months in prison for a range of offences, including making a false statement to police to hinder the discovery of evidence.

Dowidar, dressed neatly in jeans and a navy jumper with his dark hair slicked back, waved to his older brother and grinned broadly as he was led from the dock in the Downing Centre District Court.

The court found Dowidar lent his luxury white Lexus to another man to drive the de facto leader of Brothers For Life, Mohammed Hamzy, to the Greenacre street where gang member Yehya Amoud was shot dead in October 2012.

Dowidar told police shortly after the shooting that his four-wheel-drive "wasn't being driven" on the day and it was "home all day". SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Former Brothers For Life senior member Mohammed Hamzy. Photo: Supplied "This was clearly false and he knew it to be false," Judge Syme said. Months later, Dowidar reported the Lexus stolen and it was found burnt out. A witness told Dowidar's judge-alone trial the 4WD had to be destroyed as the gang was "concerned about it being bugged" by police after it was seized for forensic examination, Judge Syme said. In a scathing assessment, Judge Syme said Dowidar continued to "avoid responsibility" for his crimes and had "little respect" for the court or his own family. His "misguided loyalty to a violent person such as Mr Hamzy is not in his own or the community's best interests", she said. His lack of remorse or "acceptance of even the slightest responsibility" was "immature and self-defeating" and meant his prospects of rehabilitation in prison were "only hopeful". He had "not been offence-free" since the crimes and was caught driving while disqualified again in 2015. Judge Syme said while the replica pistol could not be fired it was "a good imitation, according to evidence before the court" and could be used to threaten people. She said corrective services should try to ensure Dowidar was "not housed with other Brothers for Life members" in jail. A jury found Hamzy guilty of manslaughter last year over the death of Mr Amoud. Judge Syme said there was "no sensible explanation" for Dowidar attending Hamzy's trial when he had been ordered not to associate with Brothers for Life members. Dowidar had already been sentenced for drug possession and driving while disqualified at the time of the shooting. Judge Syme said Dowidar had been "extended considerable leniency by the courts" in the past but had not taken advantage of it and was "not entitled to any leniency for this offence". At the time of his arrest in November 2013, Dowidar's solicitor cast his client as a boy from a middle-class Belmore home, with a clean criminal record save for a few driving offences. He had worked for Google through a contractor for five years, during which time the tech giant regularly topped the list of best places to work and had become known for its beanbag-filled meeting rooms, ping-pong tables and free cafeteria. His contract ended in May 2013. Judge Syme said his employment was "terminated at about the time his criminal offending escalated dramatically".  At Dowidar's bail hearing following his November 2013 arrest, Magistrate Elaine Truscott remarked he appeared to be "living a double life". Dowidar was one of 10 senior Brothers For Life members arrested during simultaneous raids across Sydney aimed at breaking up the group and ending a spate of shootings across the city. Picked up with Dowidar was Hamzy, the leader of the group's Bankstown chapter, who was also known as also known as "Little Crazy" of "LC". Throughout Hamzy's three-week trial the jury gained a small insight into the world of the now-defunct but once incredibly violent Brothers for Life gang. The street gang operated outside the law, bound by loyalties to each other. But when the long-time friends fell out, or rivalries arose, there were ways to take the law into their own hands. Hamzy was sentenced last October to 11 and a half years behind bars with a non-parole period of eight and a half years. with Ava Benny-Morrison and Nick Ralston WHO WERE BROTHERS FOR LIFE The violent street gang "Brothers for Life" first came to the attention of the NSW police in 2008, when convicted murderer Bassam Hamzy was caught running a sophisticated drug supply network while in Lithgow jail. Hamzy, who had been in custody since March 1999 for a series of crimes including drug supply, murder and conspiracy to murder, was able to make 19,523 calls using a mobile phone hidden in his cell to direct the drug deals between Sydney and Melbourne. It was during this time that the BFL "banner" as police called it, began to appear. Most of those who associated themselves with it were direct relatives of Hamzy and police believe the name was intended as a "show of support" and "loyalty" to their imprisoned "brother". A violent, internal feud within the gang erupted in 2013 resulting in a string of tit-for-tat shootings between the group's Blacktown and Bankstown chapters. The head of Blacktown chapter was Farhad Qaumi, nicknamed "The Afghan", was appointed as the BFL's "general" in 2012 by Bassam Hamzy. Hamzy's cousin, Mohammed Hamzy who was known as Little Crazy or LC was the head of the Bankstown Chapter. The internal war resulted in two killings, 11 shootings, two knee-cappings and several bashings. Police moved in, laying more than 300 charges against 21 members and in November 2014 senior officers declared that Brothers For Life had been dismantled. Clarification: an earlier version of this story described Dowidar as a Google employee. He was in fact contracted to the software giant through a third party.

Would turning to Google help? Seeing how it works for Google raises questions, but may also lead to some answers. By George Anadiotis for Big on Data | January 6, 2017 -- 17:32 GMT (09:32 PST) | Topic: Big Data Analytics Descriptive analytics -- looking into what has happened in the past -- is commoditized. Traditional BI, reports, and dashboards are well understood and used in one way or another across a wide spectrum of organizations to keep an eye on their operations. Predictive analytics -- trying to predict what will happen in the future -- is in the limelight. Today many organizations are scrambling to utilize predictive models leveraging data and Machine Learning (ML) in the hope that this will empower them to anticipate future developments. Prescriptive analytics is different. Neither what it is nor how it's supposed to work are entirely clear. So when faced with questions, would turning to Google help answer them? Let's have a look at YouTube, the most massive and widely used media channel on the planet, as a case study to examine prescriptive analytics. Everyone, meet prescriptive analytics special feature IoT: The Security Challenge The Internet of Things is creating serious new security risks. We examine the possibilities and the dangers. Read More Gartner's definition of prescriptive analytics is "a form of advanced analytics which examines data or content to answer the question "What should be done?" or "What can we do to make _______ happen?", and is characterized by techniques such as graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, recommendation engines, heuristics, and machine learning." Cryptic much? Lisa Kart, Gartner analyst, offered a more tangible approach by stating that "Prescriptive analytics is about applying logic and mathematics to data, with the goal to specify a preferred course of action- unlike other types of analytics the output is a decision." So the result of applying prescriptive analytics is not information about the past, not predictions about the future, but decisions. But establishing this as the definition of prescriptive analytics is just the onset for more questions. To begin with, while the definition of predictive analytics does not really expand on the technical approaches of applying it, the definition of predictive analytics goes to some lengths to list an array of potential techniques. Why the difference? And does using any of the listed techniques in and of itself qualify an analytics solution as "prescriptive analytics"? One interpretation for the emphasis on technologies in Gartner's definition is that unlike predictive analytics, for which using ML seems to be a given, prescriptive analytics is fluid, less anchored, and perhaps less understood at this point. At any rate, solutions using any of the technologies listed should not be awarded the "prescriptive" moniker based on this criterion alone. There are other questions to ask that can perhaps serve better as criteria for classification. Bottomless bowls, infinite feeds, and autoplay The more videos users watch, the better for Google's bottom line. Hence, recommendations are an important part of YouTube. Image: Tristan Harris Other questions such as, which decision exactly are we talking about here? What are the options to choose from, and who makes the decision? For sure, being able to predict the future helps with decisions. But doesn't a decision imply action in the future anyway? So where exactly are the boundaries between predictive and prescriptive? When faced with overwhelming questions, people often turn to Google. This could possibly help in this case too, although not in the way Google is often used. Google is -- among other things -- the proud owner of YouTube. An iconic example of a data-powered product by a data-powered organization. The product, in typical Google fashion, is advertisements paid for by third parties and targeting consumers -- users viewing YouTube content. Every YouTube video is viewed alongside advertisements, which consumers occasionally click, bringing advertisement revenue to Google. This business model has some interesting implications. It implies that the more videos users will watch, the more advertisements they will be shown, and the higher the chances some of them will be clicked. Therefore, the more videos users consume, the more revenue for Google. So answers to the question "What can we do to make people watch more videos" are of great interest for Google. Apparently "show them more videos they will like" ranked high among other options. Tristan Harris, ex-design ethicist at Google, elaborated on design hacks used to this effect, including what he called "bottomless bowls, infinite feeds, and autoplay." But at the end of the day, if the content is not relevant, how much good can such hacks do? Case in point -- there has been a fair amount of criticism on the relevance of YouTube recommended videos. Google, meet the analytics continuum YouTube's latest recommendation engine features 2 layers of Deep Learning that enable it to sort through complex combinations of video factors. Is this prescriptive analytics? Image: Covington/Adams/Sargin - Google Google responded by revamping YouTube's recommendation engine. Previously, recommended videos on YouTube have been served based on the same principles driving Amazon's recommendation engine. The architecture and techniques utilized in YouTube's recommendation engine have been outlined in a paper recently published by Google engineers. Who really owns your Internet of Things data? In a world where more and more objects are coming online and vendors are getting involved in the supply chain, how can you keep track of what's yours and what's not? Read More Google uses two layers of deep neural networks to narrow down the immense stock of YouTube videos to a ranked list of recommendations. Recommendation generation is modeled as (extreme) multiclass classification, producing an initial pool of recommendations subsequently ranked using logistic regression. So how would that be classified then? Definitely not descriptive analytics, but is it predictive or prescriptive? Depending on how one looks at it, it might as well be either. As per another definition, "the prescriptive approach analyzes potential decisions, the interactions between decisions, the influences that bear upon these decisions and the bearing all of the above has on an outcome to ultimately prescribe an optimal course of action in real time." One cited example is airline ticket pricing systems that use prescriptive analytics to sort through complex combinations of travel factors, demand levels, and purchase timing to present potential passengers with prices designed to optimize profits but also not deter sales One could argue that this is about making predictions about what users will like, so it's predictive. One could also argue that this is about helping Google answer the "What can we do to make people watch more videos" question, and sorting through complex combinations of video factors, so it's prescriptive. One could probably argue over definitions for a long time, which goes to show that using he descriptive-predictive-prescriptive classification can be hard. Not only does it look and feel more like a continuum than a set of discrete classes, but the progression in the continuum is not entirely straightforward either. Great -- but does it work? Having explicit feedback matters for the development of YouTube recommendations, which is why Google set out to get it. Image: Corbin Davenport / Android Police So how well is the new recommendation engine performing? Opinions vary apparently. Striving for improvement, Google has explicitly sought after user feedback. Spontaneous, public user feedback however appears to be mostly negative at this time. On the other hand, there have also been some positive remarks, specifically about the next to watch feature. As this presumably is the top-ranked result of the engine, maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel. Anecdotal evidence from people with tastes in music ranging from eclectic to mainstream also points towards a sometimes surprising aptitude to auto-compile engaging playlists as of late. So the jury on what this is and whether it works is still out. However there are still many aspects regarding the intricacies and alternatives in implementing YouTube's call-them-what-you-will analytics that are worth exploring, and we will continue to do so on our tour in the land of the analytics continuum.

At the beginning a user had to interact with levers and switches, then came screens and DOS, the Apple’s Macintosh and Microsoft’s Windows, and, finally, the internet. These slowly wormed their way into our lives and changed the way we do almost everything. But the OS of the future is going to be something different entirely. The next step is artificial intelligence, and there’s a land rush going on. Just think of how profitable Microsoft’s control of the previous epoch was. How operating systems evolved In the 70s, many of us cut our teeth with command line systems like MS-DOS, CP/M and Unix. Just imagine the black screens with green type. You could type almost meaningful commands like “cp” to copy a file. This was pretty geeky, but a little less than physical switches. In the 80s, computing moved over to graphical interfaces like Mac OS and Windows where you could simply point and click. Want to delete a file? Simply drag it into the bin. What could be simpler? Computing was no longer just for geeks. Almost anyone could do it. In the 90s, computing became more connected. The internet took off and the browser became king. Indeed, Google have made a whole Operating System out of this, Chrome OS. And more recently, computing became mobile and moved onto apps on our smartphones. Some of these apps and services started branching out, creating their own little worlds to bring together developers and users. There is probably no better example than the Chinese app WeChat, which has thousands of applications, from social networking through buying airline tickets. You might not realize it but the next revolution in Operating Systems is now under way. And the technology giants like Microsoft, Apple and Google are racing to be the winner. The new race Late last year Google announced a series of hardware products. There was Google Home speaker, Pixel smartphone, and the virtual reality headset Daydream View. But Google isn’t going to make billions out of hardware like this. Software is a much better business to be in. It scales so much more easily. No, Google is producing this hardware just as a means of getting its AI-based Google Assistant into our homes and our pockets. Assistant is baked into all of these products, and through it, Google wants to be at the centre of our lives, however we connect. Conversational assistants like Assistant and Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa are the Operating System of the future. No more typing. No more pointing. The power of Artificial Intelligence will be harnessed to serve our needs. “Get me on the next flight to Canberra, Google”. “Who’s the President of Switzerland, Siri?” “Play me that jazz saxonophist that I like, Alexa.” In many cases, there won’t be a keyboard in sight. We’ll walk into some new room and say “Turn on the lights” and expect someone will be listening. Sorry, something will be listening. We’ll sit it our car and simply announce “start the ignition”. We’ll get into a lift and command “top floor, please”. We’ll walk into the bathroom and say “run me a bath”. Screens will disappear. In its place, will be conversations. Conversations that will follow us from room to room, to car, to office and to bed. The knock on effects of all this will be huge. The loss of screens will mean digital advertising must be rethought. The rise of conversation will impact search and online networking. Whoever wins the race to define this new operating system will take the lead in all of this. Winners and losers This is an exciting future. There are plenty of opportunities for the bold. To build a watch that doubles as your personal assistant. Sunglasses that tell you when you’ve had too much sun. A weighing scale that offers advice about your diet. The likely winners are companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or Amazon because they are the first movers, and the theory of network effects mean their products will likely rapidly improve. The likely losers are privacy, diversity and democracy. The NSA can’t wait for every room to be listening. Marketers can’t wait to see all this data on our everyday lives.

Credit: Linksys More like this 9 Alexa tips and tricks With Ford, Amazon's Alexa hits the road Why Google A.I. is the last user interface Video Mingis on Tech: New year, new CES -- and new AirPods Amazon's Alexa won CES this week. Amazon's virtual assistant, which first appeared more than two years ago on Amazon's Echo smart speaker, seemed to be popping up everywhere at the annual International CES trade show in Las Vegas this week. Amazon opened Alexa to third-party hardware developers in the summer of 2015. Now, a year and a half later, the number of devices that support Alexa are dizzying. (We also learned this week that Alexa now offers more than 7,000 "skills," which is what Amazon calls apps or third-party capabilities.) The chatter about Alexa at CES is broadly muddled, with reporters talking about devices "supporting Alexa." But not all "support" is created equal. Most of this "support" is relative banal. It means that a smart device gains the ability to be controlled or monitored through Alexa. Appliance maker Whirlpool, for example, announced this week a new line of home appliances available in "early 2017" that respond to Alexa commands. They'll let you change the temperature of your Whirlpool refrigerator by telling Alexa. And the virtual assistant will be able to tell you if your Whirlpool washer and dryer is running and how much time is left before the clothes are done. LG The LG Smart InstaView fridge has Alexa support built in. It's like a giant Amazon Echo that also keeps your food cold. Dish Network's Hopper DVR boxes are getting Alexa control. As with Apple TV, you'll be able to use voice commands and conversation to find shows and change the channel. ADT Pulse also got Alexa support this week. After February, users will be able to arm and disarm their home alarm security systems and deadbolts by talking to Alexa. Access to the security system is granted when you speak a four-digit PIN code. Of course, when you speak a PIN code, others can hear it, then later use it from outside the house (if they yell loud enough) to disable the security system. Users should be careful with this one. We also learned this week that Alexa support is being extended to the Belkin WeMo Dimmer Wi-Fi light switch and WeMo Mini; Carrier Cor 5C and 7C Smart Thermostats; Element, Sieki and Westinghouse smart TVs; First Alert OneLink Environment Monitor; the Incipio CommandKit Wi-Fi light switch and Wireless smart power strip; Vobot Clock; iHome's iAVS16 bedside speaker; SkylinkNet™ connected home suite; Coway's Airmega smart air purifier; Hubble Hugo mood-tracking smart camera; Sensory VoiceGenie; Jam Audio speakers; Bixi gesture controller and other devices. I like this brand of "Alexa" support. But it's not nearly as interesting and culture-changing as the other kind: When devices actually deliver Alexa itself. Alexa appliances at CES The Lenovo Smart Assistant, for example, is just like Amazon's own Echo, but with better sound. Omaker Wow Wireless Wifi Portable Bluetooth Speakers with Amazon Alexa are also straight-up alternatives to Amazon's Echo, Echo Dot and Tap devices. Two devices, the Nabi Aristotle (Nabi is a Mattel company) and the C-Way Memoo are Amazon-Echo like devices for children. These are proving controversial because the idea of a corporation listening in on children is creepy to some parents. They can read stories to children and broadly function as a kind of robot babysitter, to a limited degree. While Echo alternatives are welcome, they're not nearly as interesting and surprising as some of the other new appliances delivering Alexa. When Google announced its OnHub router in 2015 and Google WiFi mesh routers last year, a few pundits asked: "Why didn't they put Google Now or the Google Assistant on these routers?" It's a good question. But at CES, Linksys became the first company to announce the idea of a virtual assistant on a mesh router system. The company unveiled this week it's Linksys Velop Whole Home Wi-Fi system. The mesh routers provide full coverage in a home by creating a chain of wireless connectivity, which extends Wi-Fi more broadly in a home than a single router can. The Linksys Velop ships Jan. 15 in packs of one ($200), two ($350) or three ($500). Each router provides the speaker and microphone needed to interact with Alexa. A company called Ubtech Robotics unveiled a robot called Lynx at CES that has Alexa inside. The robot has its own capabilities unrelated to Alexa, such as the ability to recognize faces and demonstrate fitness exercises, but also functions just like an Amazon Echo. LG also announced an Alexa robot at CES. The company didn't provide all the details, but the Hub robot appears to be a small robot that simply functions as an Amazon Echo type device, but with a personality, expressed through its round display and ability to swivel to face whomever is talking to it. Unlike the Whirlpool refrigerator, which can be minimally controlled by Alexa commands, LG announced a fridge that actually functions as an Alexa device. The LG Smart InstaView fridge has a camera inside so you can check what you need while you're at the store, and also a screen on the outside. The screen is interesting: By tapping on the screen twice, it becomes a transparent window so you can see what's inside without opening the door. Gadget fans will also be intrigued by the operating system that powers some of the smart features: It's WebOS! (The WebOS operating system evolved from the Palm WebOS system that used to power Palm smartphones and tablets.) Chinese smartphone giant Huawei announced at CES that its $599.99 Mate 9 phablet would become the first smartphone to ship with Alexa integration pre-installed and integrated. While Alexa is available in a smattering of mobile apps for both Android and iOS platforms, the Huawei integration appears to offer "always-listening" hands-free access to Alexa. All these new Alexa appliances join several announced last year, including a lamp called the C by GE. I really like this idea because, as I said in this space a year ago, lights and light bulbs are uniquely suitable as locations for virtual assistants. One line of products shown at CES functions both as an Alexa-controlled device and an Alexa appliance: Ford cars. The first implementation will show up in the Focus Electric, Fusion Energi, and C-Max Energi cars. Ford Sync Connect users will gain the ability to start, lock or unlock the doors, and get information about the car from any Alexa device. Later this summer, Alexa itself will be made available in Ford cars, so you can interact with Alexa from inside the car, including the ability to control the audio system with voice commands. The car dashboard works like an Amazon Echo. When virtual assistants are everywhere and always listening Let's be clear about what's happening with virtual assistants. As I predicted in this space in 2014, within a few years, you will almost never be out of virtual assistant range. When you talk, they will hear you. You won't even have to think about which device is serving you. Just ask a question and a voice will answer. There are two ways to achieve this: The Apple way and the Amazon way. The Apple way is to serve up its Siri virtual assistant primarily as a feature on mobile devices like the iPhone and the Apple Watch (two exceptions are the stationary Apple TV and iMac). By choosing "Allow 'Hey Siri' " in the settings of an iPhone, your phone is always listening for the "Hey Siri" command. Everywhere you go, Siri is listening, as long as you bring your iPhone. The Amazon way is to offer Alexa Echo appliances for every room in the house and also open its virtual assistant to hardware developers so Amazon is built into every appliance, vehicle and object in the home and office. The Google way, meanwhile, is to do both at the same time -- get a virtual assistant into every phone, on every computer and also open to third parties. Google is more than a year behind Amazon in third-party integration. The biggest challenge for Google in this space is Google itself. Google's virtual assistant strategy is muddled and confusing. Quick, what's Google's virtual assistant? Is it the Google Assistant? Or is it Google Now? And what is Google Voice Search? Isn't Google Assistant mostly just Google Voice Search? Who knows? Regardless, Amazon and Google will get virtual assistants into just about every category of internet of things device. You'll talk to the fridge. You'll talk to the toaster. You'll talk to the toilet. Everything will be listening. Everything will know you, guide you, inform you, entertain you and do things for you. As everything continues moving to the cloud, our virtual assistants will become our main interface to the cloud -- which is to say our main interface to everything. As Star Trekish and awesome as this will be, you can be sure that new problems will arise. Alexa-powered devices, such as Amazon's own Echo appliance, are always listening for a "wake word" -- the word that triggers the device to listen for other commands and requests. Alexa's "wake word" is "Alexa," or alternatively "Amazon." (This is a bummer for one Reddit user, who claims that he has two daughters named "Alexa" and "Amazon."). Virtual assistants will end the use of "Alexa" or "Siri" as names for children or pets. The assistants everywhere world will raise new issues around privacy and security. They'll even challenge the necessity of knowledge itself, or at least trivial knowledge. After all, if every fact is instantly accessible with a question, what's the point of committing any fact to memory? The new world of ubiquitous virtual assistants has been creeping up on us for a decade. But CES this week was a turning point. It's clear we enter that world this year, in 2017.

Amazon opened Alexa to third-party hardware developers in the summer of 2015. Now, a year and a half later, the number of devices that support Alexa are dizzying. (We also learned this week that Alexa now offers more than 7,000 "skills," which is what Amazon calls apps or third-party capabilities.) The chatter about Alexa at CES is broadly muddled, with reporters talking about devices "supporting Alexa." But not all "support" is created equal. Most of this "support" is relative banal. It means that a smart device gains the ability to be controlled or monitored through Alexa. Appliance maker Whirlpool, for example, announced this week a new line of home appliances available in "early 2017" that respond to Alexa commands. They'll let you change the temperature of your Whirlpool refrigerator by telling Alexa. And the virtual assistant will be able to tell you if your Whirlpool washer and dryer is running and how much time is left before the clothes are done. LG The LG Smart InstaView fridge has Alexa support built in. It's like a giant Amazon Echo that also keeps your food cold. Dish Network's Hopper DVR boxes are getting Alexa control. As with Apple TV, you'll be able to use voice commands and conversation to find shows and change the channel. ADT Pulse also got Alexa support this week. After February, users will be able to arm and disarm their home alarm security systems and deadbolts by talking to Alexa. Access to the security system is granted when you speak a four-digit PIN code. Of course, when you speak a PIN code, others can hear it, then later use it from outside the house (if they yell loud enough) to disable the security system. Users should be careful with this one. We also learned this week that Alexa support is being extended to the Belkin WeMo Dimmer Wi-Fi light switch and WeMo Mini; Carrier Cor 5C and 7C Smart Thermostats; Element, Sieki and Westinghouse smart TVs; First Alert OneLink Environment Monitor; the Incipio CommandKit Wi-Fi light switch and Wireless smart power strip; Vobot Clock; iHome's iAVS16 bedside speaker; SkylinkNet™ connected home suite; Coway's Airmega smart air purifier; Hubble Hugo mood-tracking smart camera; Sensory VoiceGenie; Jam Audio speakers; Bixi gesture controller and other devices. I like this brand of "Alexa" support. But it's not nearly as interesting and culture-changing as the other kind: When devices actually deliver Alexa itself. Alexa appliances at CES The Lenovo Smart Assistant, for example, is just like Amazon's own Echo, but with better sound. Omaker Wow Wireless Wifi Portable Bluetooth Speakers with Amazon Alexa are also straight-up alternatives to Amazon's Echo, Echo Dot and Tap devices. Two devices, the Nabi Aristotle (Nabi is a Mattel company) and the C-Way Memoo are Amazon-Echo like devices for children. These are proving controversial because the idea of a corporation listening in on children is creepy to some parents. They can read stories to children and broadly function as a kind of robot babysitter, to a limited degree. While Echo alternatives are welcome, they're not nearly as interesting and surprising as some of the other new appliances delivering Alexa. When Google announced its OnHub router in 2015 and Google WiFi mesh routers last year, a few pundits asked: "Why didn't they put Google Now or the Google Assistant on these routers?" It's a good question. But at CES, Linksys became the first company to announce the idea of a virtual assistant on a mesh router system. The company unveiled this week it's Linksys Velop Whole Home Wi-Fi system. The mesh routers provide full coverage in a home by creating a chain of wireless connectivity, which extends Wi-Fi more broadly in a home than a single router can. The Linksys Velop ships Jan. 15 in packs of one ($200), two ($350) or three ($500). Each router provides the speaker and microphone needed to interact with Alexa. A company called Ubtech Robotics unveiled a robot called Lynx at CES that has Alexa inside. The robot has its own capabilities unrelated to Alexa, such as the ability to recognize faces and demonstrate fitness exercises, but also functions just like an Amazon Echo. LG also announced an Alexa robot at CES. The company didn't provide all the details, but the Hub robot appears to be a small robot that simply functions as an Amazon Echo type device, but with a personality, expressed through its round display and ability to swivel to face whomever is talking to it. Unlike the Whirlpool refrigerator, which can be minimally controlled by Alexa commands, LG announced a fridge that actually functions as an Alexa device. The LG Smart InstaView fridge has a camera inside so you can check what you need while you're at the store, and also a screen on the outside. The screen is interesting: By tapping on the screen twice, it becomes a transparent window so you can see what's inside without opening the door. Gadget fans will also be intrigued by the operating system that powers some of the smart features: It's WebOS! (The WebOS operating system evolved from the Palm WebOS system that used to power Palm smartphones and tablets.) Chinese smartphone giant Huawei announced at CES that its $599.99 Mate 9 phablet would become the first smartphone to ship with Alexa integration pre-installed and integrated. While Alexa is available in a smattering of mobile apps for both Android and iOS platforms, the Huawei integration appears to offer "always-listening" hands-free access to Alexa. All these new Alexa appliances join several announced last year, including a lamp called the C by GE. I really like this idea because, as I said in this space a year ago, lights and light bulbs are uniquely suitable as locations for virtual assistants. One line of products shown at CES functions both as an Alexa-controlled device and an Alexa appliance: Ford cars. The first implementation will show up in the Focus Electric, Fusion Energi, and C-Max Energi cars. Ford Sync Connect users will gain the ability to start, lock or unlock the doors, and get information about the car from any Alexa device. Later this summer, Alexa itself will be made available in Ford cars, so you can interact with Alexa from inside the car, including the ability to control the audio system with voice commands. The car dashboard works like an Amazon Echo. When virtual assistants are everywhere and always listening Let's be clear about what's happening with virtual assistants. As I predicted in this space in 2014, within a few years, you will almost never be out of virtual assistant range. When you talk, they will hear you. You won't even have to think about which device is serving you. Just ask a question and a voice will answer. There are two ways to achieve this: The Apple way and the Amazon way. The Apple way is to serve up its Siri virtual assistant primarily as a feature on mobile devices like the iPhone and the Apple Watch (two exceptions are the stationary Apple TV and iMac). By choosing "Allow 'Hey Siri' " in the settings of an iPhone, your phone is always listening for the "Hey Siri" command. Everywhere you go, Siri is listening, as long as you bring your iPhone. The Amazon way is to offer Alexa Echo appliances for every room in the house and also open its virtual assistant to hardware developers so Amazon is built into every appliance, vehicle and object in the home and office. The Google way, meanwhile, is to do both at the same time -- get a virtual assistant into every phone, on every computer and also open to third parties. Google is more than a year behind Amazon in third-party integration. The biggest challenge for Google in this space is Google itself. Google's virtual assistant strategy is muddled and confusing. Quick, what's Google's virtual assistant? Is it the Google Assistant? Or is it Google Now? And what is Google Voice Search? Isn't Google Assistant mostly just Google Voice Search? Who knows? Regardless, Amazon and Google will get virtual assistants into just about every category of internet of things device. You'll talk to the fridge. You'll talk to the toaster. You'll talk to the toilet. Everything will be listening. Everything will know you, guide you, inform you, entertain you and do things for you. As everything continues moving to the cloud, our virtual assistants will become our main interface to the cloud -- which is to say our main interface to everything. As Star Trekish and awesome as this will be, you can be sure that new problems will arise. Alexa-powered devices, such as Amazon's own Echo appliance, are always listening for a "wake word" -- the word that triggers the device to listen for other commands and requests. Alexa's "wake word" is "Alexa," or alternatively "Amazon." (This is a bummer for one Reddit user, who claims that he has two daughters named "Alexa" and "Amazon."). Virtual assistants will end the use of "Alexa" or "Siri" as names for children or pets. The assistants everywhere world will raise new issues around privacy and security. They'll even challenge the necessity of knowledge itself, or at least trivial knowledge. After all, if every fact is instantly accessible with a question, what's the point of committing any fact to memory? The new world of ubiquitous virtual assistants has been creeping up on us for a decade. But CES this week was a turning point. It's clear we enter that world this year, in 2017. Will you remember when it happened? Don't bother. All you'll have to do is ask. Advance into senior IT roles with project management skills More from RMIT University Join the TechWorld newsletter!

Google to Shut Down Hangouts API on April 25 GO After April 25, apps in Hangouts will stop working Jan 7, 2017 11:45 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has just announced that it decided to shut down Hangouts API starting April 25, 2017. This means that all applications using the Hangouts API will no longer work after the date. In a post on the Hangouts API platform, Google announced that it would retire the Google+ Hangouts API, which allows developers to create apps for the older version of Hangouts video calls. The API was initially developed to support social experiences for end-users, as part of Google+. However, Hangouts is now changing and Google wants the app to focus on enterprise consumption more. “We understand this will impact developers who have invested in our platform. We have carefully considered this change and believe that the latest updates allow us to give our users a more targeted Hangouts desktop video experience going forward,” Google said in a post. A small number of apps will continue to function The report also mentions that a few apps will continue to function past April 25, including DialPad and RingCentral apps for dialing into a call or integration with Slack, another enterprise communications tool. In addition, Hangouts on Air broadcasting tools, like Toolbox, Control Room and Cameraman will continue to run. Users of apps containing the Hangouts API will receive a notice informing them that the app will no longer work after April 25. Back in September 2016, Google did showcase new features for Hangouts, aimed mainly at meetings and conference calls. Google has already started to replace Hangouts with Allo in the package of pre-installed apps on Android phones. Allo offers both video and messaging tools, and it comes with integrated Google Assistant. Just yesterday, we reported that Google acquired Limes Audio to improve the quality of video conference calls in Hangouts, another proof that the company’s Hangouts app is heading in the direction of enterprise users. #Google#Hangouts#Allo#Google+#Slack subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Assistant on Pixel Phones to Get Support for Keyboard Input Google Makes Gboard App Official, Up for Download in the Play Store Google Renames Keyboard App for Android to Gboard, Adds New Features Google Details Android 7.1.1 Nougat's New Features and Improvements It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs Linux Kernel 4.9.4 Released with Various ARM/ARM64 and Networking Improvements    Google Hangouts logo New Android APKs imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Qualcomm Says Nokia Phone Caught on Video at CES Is a Reference Design Device more on: Nokia 8 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The new ‘Goals’ feature in Google Calendar will help users find time for ‘the things that matter’. Google says that you can set a goal, for example ‘run three times a week” and Calendar will find the time for you in your schedule and also help you stick to it. Starting today, users can connected their Google Calendar to Apple Health and Google Fit. After doing so, the activity your fitness apps record will be used to mark your goals in Google Calendar as “Done” automatically. “If you’re setting out to achieve a goal, seeing progress can be a great motivation. Goals in Google Calendar makes finding time for activities like hitting the gym or going on more runs easy. But it hasn’t been as easy to track whether you’re reaching that goal — even if you’re using fitness tracking apps in parallel — since you still have to manually mark your goal “Done” every time,” Google explained in a blogpost. Google says that with this integration, future goal times can be even more tailored made based on when you are most likely to complete them. If you set a goal to run at 5:30 am every other morning, but you haven’t actually been hitting your stride until 7:00 – Google Calendar will adjust accordingly. So not only can Calendar keep track of your activities and performance, it can also help you find the best time to do them. Read: Nokia E1 specs leaked online: Entry-level smartphone featuring 2GB RAM Google had introduced its Goals API in its Google Fit app (Android) back in October 2016. Chances are that Google will be integrating more services with ‘Goals’ to Google Calendar eventually. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Google Best of Express Meghalaya sex scam: Guest-house owned by Home Minister’s family under probe EntertainmentOk Jaanu box office collection day 3: Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor film struggles to hold ground EntertainmentxXx Return of Xander Cage box office collection day 2: Deepika Padukone-Vin Diesel film expected to earn well EntertainmentSalman Khan shares nostalgic picture from sets of Karan Arjun, wishes SRK-Hrithik for Raees-Kaabil EntertainmentKoffee With Karan: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor turn Karan Johar's show into a mini kitty party Must Read SportsKohli, Kedar hit magical tons to script sensational win SportsThis win is going to take a while to sink in, says Kohli SportsVirat Kohli leaves Twitterati awe-struck after century TechnologyNokia could be developing a foldable smartphone, hints patent TechnologyLenovo sends out press invite for MWC 2017, may debut Moto G5 Plus TechnologyFormer Android chief Andy Rubin to release a high-end, AI-focused smartphone  Sonam Kapoor, Frieda Pinto, Pooja Hegde: Best and worst dressed Bollywood divas at Filmfare Awards 2017 Jan 16: Latest News Centre issues draft requirements under digital village initiative Startup India: 2016 not a good year as new startups decline by 67% China finally agrees to import buffalo meat from India Kathputli Colony: Life at the transit camp C N Rao at Jamia Hamdard Convocation: ‘To excel in science, we need hard work, funds for varsities’                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

The demand by Russian authorities to remove LinkedIn in Apple and Google app stores comes weeks after a court blocked the professional networking service for flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on Russian citizens within the nation’s borders, The New York Times reports. The action puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens. When LinkedIn’s website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly. Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple’s App Store may not have cut off access to content, but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps. Direct blocking of websites has been done by China, Russia, Turkey and several other nations for years, usually through their state-run internet service providers. But civil rights groups say the pressure authoritarian governments are now placing on Apple and Google is a new wrinkle. “Apps are the new choke point of free expression,” said Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America. Increasingly, United States tech companies are complying with those demands. In the early 2000s, American internet firms strongly pushed back on demands by China to comply with censorship rules within the country’s internet controls, known as the Great Firewall. Recently, Facebook has been working on a censorship tool to be able to access China, where it is currently blocked along with Twitter and Google. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was “disappointed” with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service, which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores. “It denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,” said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. Apple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app, but declined to comment further on both events. Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates. More nations have enforced their own internet laws in recent years. Turkey intermittently blocks social media, such as during the attempted government coup last summer. It has also forced YouTube to remove content it considers disparaging of its modern-day founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. European nations have also drawn up their own privacy laws and in 2014 a court declared its citizens could demand internet companies like Google unlink information about users upon request. Tech companies and civil rights advocates warn that the increasing push by nations to create their own internet rules will Balkanize the internet and potentially lead to privacy violations and the stifling of political dissent. Other countries, however, criticize Silicon Valley and the United States government for setting the norms and rules for the internet. “Internet free speech and internet freedom are increasingly under attack all over the globe, and not just from authoritarian regimes,” said Robert M. McDowell, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission and partner at Cooley law firm. “It appears to be a one-way ratchet with speech control getting tighter.” LinkedIn has several million users in Russia, it said. In November, a Russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on Russian accounts within the nation. Most American internet companies in Russia operate in violation of the law, but without explanation, Russian regulators at a body known as Roskomnadzor took the rare step of enforcing its rules. The Russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment. The action came at a tense moment in Russian-United States relations related to cyber affairs. Russia has been accused of hacking into American accounts, including the Democratic National Committee, to try to influence the presidential election. American intelligence officials concluded in a declassified report released on Friday that the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered the campaign. Related links: The New York Times.

Massive immigration to North America meant that not only were more people were moving, but thanks to steam engines, were doing it more quickly.  Read more Canada says high-speed Internet is essential for quality of life Technological advances also included communications, and it was easier to quickly pass messages across vast distances.    Fleming wrote in 1876: “Within a comparatively recent period, the human race has acquired a control over a power which already has, in a remarkable degree, changed the condition of human affairs. “The application of steam to a locomotive by land and water has given enormous stimulus to progress throughout the world, and with the electric telegraph as auxiliary, has somewhat rudely shaken customs and habits which have been handed down to us by bygone centuries. “We still cling, however, to the system of Chronometry inherited from a remote antiquity.” Namely, people tended to use the location of the sun in the sky to tell the time.  World news in pictures 47 show all World news in pictures 1/47 12 January 2017 A former Filipino comfort woman shouts slogans as she joins a protest rally in front of the Japanese embassy in Pasay City, south of Manila, Philippines, ahead of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's official visit EPA 2/47 12 January 2017 Supporters and family members of Filipina 'comfort women', who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II, display banners during a protest in front of the Japanese embassy in Manila, hours before the arrival of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Getty 3/47 12 January 2017 Supporters and family members of Filipina 'comfort women', who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II, display banners during a protest in front of the Japanese embassy in Manila, hours before the arrival of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Getty 4/47 12 January 2017 Polish Commander of the 11th Lubuska Armoured Cavalry Division from Zagan General Jaroslaw Mika gives a speech during the official welcome ceremony of the US troops convoy in Zagan, western Poland.

However, as he journeyed west through the country, his watch was increasingly inaccurate.

In 1879 in Canada, he proposed the ideas in Terrestrial Time: That the world should be divided into 24 equal time zones, beginning with the commonly used Greenwich Mean Time from Britain, all centred around a hypothetical clock.  Fleming’s ideas led to the International Prime Meridian Conference in 1884, at which 26 powerful governments – including the British Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the United States, Japan and the German Empire – agreed to adopt the principles of the system.  While his work on time zones remains Fleming’s legacy, he contributed extensively to Canada’s development through his engineering work on the railways. He also produced numerous maps and surveys and designed the country’s first postage stamp.  More about: Sandford Fleming google doodle Chronometry Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

This wasn’t quite the humiliation it threatened to be when Real went four goals up after 31 minutes, but was still entirely straightforward. Isco scored twice, while Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Casemiro added gloss to the final score. Their unbeaten run now extends to 39 games, and they will set a new Spanish record if they avoid defeat against Sevilla in their second-leg Cup tie next week. Sevilla will offer more of a test than they got today. Thanks for joining me. Adios. The Real Madrid players celebrate against Granada and the win puts them six points clear of Barcelona.

The Limes Audio team builds technology to enhance the voice communication systems sound for a better experience during video conferencing. In fact, Google acquired Swedish communications company Marratech, back in 2007 to support Google Talk and Hangouts. However, the company hasn’t revealed any financial details of the deal till now. Limes Audio was founded in 2007 by Fredric Lindström and Christian Schuldt with a workforce of just 20. In a blog post, Google said: As more and more businesses adopt our video conferencing solutions, powered by Chromebox for Meetings and Google Hangouts, it’s critical that we provide a great audio experience. With G Suite customers now relying on video communications for their day-to-day meetings, it’s more important than ever to ensure low-cost, high-quality audio. One of the biggest challenges to a great video meeting is the audio quality. Conference rooms today come in all shapes and sizes and that can provide a challenge for acoustics. Additionally, a poor internet connection can hamper voice quality in video conference calls. Limes Audio has been building solutions that remove the distracting noise, distortion and echoes that can affect online video and telephony meetings, improving the overall online conference experience. Fredric & Christian, Founders of Limes Audio, on their website, said: Since Limes Audio was founded in 2007, we have continuously pushed the limits of speech enhancement in our mission to provide the world’s best audio conferencing experience. Over the years, we have developed our technology and craftsmanship, and we are proud to find ourselves in a market leading position for many audio conferencing applications. We are now very excited to join Google, where we will pursue objectives in line with our passion and continue to work towards all voice conversations sounding equally loud and clear, regardless of the distance or environment.

But most of these products, bogged down by glitchy software and hard-to-navigate interfaces, failed to go mainstream. This year may be different. Aided by new artificial intelligence software that makes it easier for gadgets to understand speech, tech giants led by Amazon.com Inc. are locked in a race for dominance of digital home assistants. "People are a bit disappointed with assistants, because there are no clear use cases," said Greg Gerard, creative chairman of Holi, which is debuting a $199 smart alarm clock called Bonjour. "We have one.” Gerard must show regular consumers the value of smart assistant technology. But he doesn't need to convince big technology firms, which all believe voice-based interactions with devices will explode in popularity. Almost every major tech company has or will soon introduce a digital assistant product powered by AI. And they're making a concerted effort to spread the technology everywhere. Alphabet Inc.'s Google is using CES to tout tie-ups with its smart Home speaker, a device similar to Amazon's Echo. Microsoft Corp. has invested heavily in its assistant, Cortana. Samsung Electronics Co. is set to unveil its assistant tech for its phones and other devices in 2017. Last month, Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg showed off a smart home assistant he said he coded himself.  Behind the scenes at CES, these tech behemoths will fight to get their voice-based systems into televisions, cable boxes and every home appliance, not just smartphones and PCs. Analysts expect several dozen announcements around voice-systems at this week's event in Las Vegas, including new functions for internet-connected devices and cars. Ford Motor Co. unveiled an integration with Alexa on Wednesday.  Then there are the specialized assistants, ranging from the Bonjour clock, which Gerard said will arrive later this year, to a personal home robot from startup Jibo -- a compact, futuristic device designed to recognize human emotions, said company Chief Executive Officer Steve Chambers. Research firm Tractica estimates about 40 million homes will use a voice-activated digital assistant by 2021.  Amazon's version, Alexa, introduced in 2014 on the Echo speaker, works with more than 6,000 applications, according to a company spokeswoman. On Tuesday, Amazon announced a partnership with Whirlpool Corp., adding voice command capabilities to Whirlpool washers, dryers, ovens and refrigerators.  Amazon has built an effective developer outreach strategy and introduced a $100 million investment fund for startups creating products around voice applications. Unlike other tech peers, Amazon has a dominant sales channel for its voice-assistance partners. "Amazon has been brilliant about it," said Mark Beccue, an analyst at Tractica. "They might be the best trigger to the smart home, to making it a mass-market product."  GOOGLE MAKES ITS SPLASH Last year, Biz Stone revamped his startup, Jelly Industries Inc., as a search engine—something that puts it up against Google. But when Google began hunting partners last month for its Home speaker, Jelly was among the first to sign on. Google was a zealous suitor. Employees treated him to lunch and when the deal closed a Google operative sent him an animated gif of Seinfeld characters dancing. "They've been a joy to work with," said Stone, who co-founded Twitter Inc.  Google's aggressive courtship is understandable; it's behind Amazon. Since inception, Google's business was based on keyboard-based searches. Now the web giant is refocusing its strategy around its voice assistant, a system that sits in its speaker, Pixel smartphone and—if Google succeeds— every device imaginable. On Tuesday at CES, Google announced a partnership with Hyundai Motor Co. that lets drivers control some car functions by talking to the Home speaker. It's expected to unveil more assistant partnerships with devices like smart TVs. Google has an edge in building voice technology, thanks to its unmatched repository of search data. But the company must prove it can distribute its assistant widely. Hurdles exist. The same month Google debuted its Pixel phone, Samsung, the largest Android phone manufacturer, acquired Viv Labs, a startup building a voice-powered assistant. Samsung plans to roll out an AI platform for its devices this year, the company said in a statement. Apple Inc., which tightly controls about 40 percent of U.S. smartphones, is investing in a similar push with its Siri voice assistant.  Microsoft already has software tools for developers to embed Cortana into devices, and its automotive partners will announce new integrations at CES, said Matthew Quinlan, Cortana's director of product marketing. "For Cortana to do her job, she needs to be in a lot of different devices." And there's Facebook. The company has said that Zuckerberg's smart-home tech was merely a demonstration. Yet the social network is testing more bot integrations with the AI-assistant in its popular Messenger chat app, a product Google has struggled to deliver. Still, Amazon remains the one to catch. For developers building voice-assisted tools, the company offers support from its already popular cloud-computing platform, giving it another edge. "You are not going to see a clear no. 2 emerge in 2017," said Forrester analyst Mike Gualtieri. "Technologically, Google is the closest competitor. But in terms of Google's ability to get it into homes, I question that." ASSISTANT NIGHTMARE Another question is how to make money from a voice-controlled home. Profit margins on hardware sales are usually thin and voice-controlled computers may throw a wrench in established business models, like text-based web search.   Some investors backing the technology aren't concerned. "There are lots and lots of ways you can monetize when you control the interface," said John Lilly, a venture capitalist with Greylock Partners. "You control control information flow. You can route requests. You can certainly ship people stuff."  Lilly, who backs AI assistant startup Ozlo, insists young companies can make dents in the market with more advanced technology, like systems that can carry on complex conversations, rather than the relatively simple commands Alexa uses. However, analysts are skeptical that startups can match the budgets and data reserves of public tech companies.  Still, that may not dissuade companies, large and small, from trying to build their own voice assistants. With that rush, the question of who controls the tools will become paramount. "In less than three years, every home will have the opportunity to have this digital assistant," said Forrester's Gualtieri. "Now you’ll have the question of who am I talking to: Amazon Echo or my refrigerator? So that could be a nightmare." Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

"Today's doodle reflects Fleming's legacy on this, the 190th anniversary of his birth," Google said in a statement on Saturday. It is widely believed that Sandford Fleming missing a train in Ireland due to a mistake printed in a timetable ultimately led to his brilliant idea that altered time as we know it. Sandford Fleming was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, in 1827. This was a period when regions used solar time to set their own clocks. Solar time worked well enough until trains came along and the need for standardised time arose. Following his missed train in 1876, Sandford Fleming proposed a worldwide standard time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February, 8, 1879. Sandford Fleming advocated for dividing the world into 24 time zones beginning at the Greenwich Meridian and spaced at 15 degree intervals. His proposal gave way to the International Prime Meridian Conference which convened in 1884 and was attended by 25 nations. It was here that Sandford Fleming's system of international standard time was adopted. Sandford Fleming was also known for helping build the Intercontinental Railway, serving as chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and designing Canada's first postage stamp.

LONDON — David Wynter knows the risks cyclists face on the roads as well as anyone. The first time he was hit by a vehicle was in May 2014 in East London, by a van making a U-turn without checking its mirrors. “Took me five weeks to fully recover,” he said. The second time was a little over a year later. Wynter, who is CEO of London data management startup Yambina, collided with a woman turning right into his lane. “Sprained my left wrist, needed a brace on it, a few cuts and deep bruises including my cheek where my cycling glasses cut into it.” Most people who cycle regularly in cities have a story (or two) like this — or at least know someone who does. The increased popularity of cycling, heightened driver awareness, and bike lane initiatives are helping to improve hazardous conditions. However, it doesn’t get around the fact that many urban areas are just hopelessly designed for cyclists and drivers to share the road. But some cyclists, technologists, and automobile manufacturers are starting to eagerly look at a surprising solution: Self-driving cars. Some cyclists think a golden age is right around the corner Self-driving cars, long a dream, are finally becoming a reality. Everyone from Google to Audi, from Uber to Volkswagen, are heavily investing in and developing the technology. The goal is to create totally autonomous vehicles, capable of driving in real-world conditions without any human input. Right now, 94% of all car accidents in the US are due to human error, according to Google. Roads are dangerous, and doubly so for cyclists, who don’t have metal casing to protect them. But self-driving tech — in theory — has significant advantages over any human driver. It won’t tire. It won’t get bored. It won’t be tempted to break the rules of the road. It will be able to look in every direction simultaneously. And crucially, it will have super-human reaction speeds. Together, it all adds up to potential massive improvement in safety — the kind that historically hadn’t been possible without major urban redevelopment. By some estimates, self-driving cars could save 300,000 lives a decade in the United States alone. Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesA cyclist passes an early Google self-driving car in 2012 Dr. Miklós Kiss, head of predevelopment piloted systems at Audi, thinks self-driving cars could be a boon to cyclists. It will “make it easier for cyclists because the behaviour of automated cars will be more predictable than now,” he told Business Insider. Many cyclists are equally enthusiastic. “If self-driving cars are proven safer for cyclists and pedestrians, cyclists would lay out the red carpet and welcome the revolution with both arms,” Andreas Kambanis, founder of biking site LondonCyclist.co.uk, told Business Insider. Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesHere we go, here we go, here we go. “Just under 50% of cyclist deaths on London’s roads are caused by HGVs, so if the technology extended there, we’d immediately eliminate a huge danger.” He added: “Beyond the safety aspect, self driving cars may also be more of a pleasure to drive around, as you wouldn’t expect it to do something erratic or to drive aggressively. This may in turn mean more cyclists on the road as the roads will now feel safer.” Eli Allalouf, a director at Alyo International, used to bike everywhere, he said. “But after my second bicycle were stolen and too many injuries cycling on the road I have given up … I would love to have the ability to ride my bicycle every day to work but the risk is too high as I am a family man with kids and wife … After a certain period of the fully automated cars I think there will be a huge spike in cycling.” Accounting for cyclists isn’t easy, say self-driving car companies However, engineers working on the technology say that learning to deal with cyclists is throwing up unique challenges. They’re small, fast in urban environments, and nimble — but also relatively slow on open roads, and immensely vulnerable. “Cyclists are more dynamic than cars. The biggest challenge is to predict their future behaviour and driving route. Cyclists can be found on the road and on footpaths too. Compared to cars they are not limited to only one road space. Sometimes cyclists do not obey traffic rules completely (red light-violators, etc.),” Audi’s Dr. Miklós Kiss said. “Cyclists need their own behaviour prediction model as they behave differently to car drivers and pedestrians.” Karl Iagnemma, CEO of autonomous tech startup Nutonomy, has encountered similar problems. “All autonomous vehicles under development today are being designed to detect and avoid cyclists. This requires that the sensing systems be specifically ‘trained’ to detect cyclists, and that the navigation systems be instructed how to manoeuvre in the presence of cyclists.” Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn takes a particularly dim view, telling CNBC in January 2016 that “one of the biggest problems [for self-driving cars] is people with bicycles.” GoogleGoogle’s software can detect cyclists’ hand signals and use them to figure out what the cyclist is planning to do next. “They don’t respect any rules usually,” he claimed. “The car is confused by them, because from time-to-time they behave like pedestrians and from time-to-time they behave like cars.” Google, one of the most high-profile developers of the tech, isn’t trash-talking cyclists — but recognises the difficulties they can pose. In its June 2016 progress report, Google’s self-driving car team explained how its vehicles treat cyclists differently (and “conservatively”) to other road users. “For example, when our sensors detect a parallel-parked car with an open door near a cyclist, our car is programmed to slow down or nudge over to give the rider enough space to move towards the center of the lane and avoid the door,” the Google team wrote. “We also aim to give cyclists ample buffer room when we pass, and our cars won’t squeeze by when cyclists take the center of the lane, even if there’s technically enough space. Whether the road is too narrow or they’re making a turn, we respect this indication that cyclists want to claim their lane.” And because cyclists don’t have indicator lights, the technology has to predict cyclists’ intentions another way: By reading their hand gestures using its in-built cameras. Jeff Swensen/Getty ImagesAn Uber driverless Ford Fusion drives down Smallman Street on September, 22, 2016 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Uber’s self-driving car trials in December 2016 clearly illustrated the dangers the tech can pose to cyclists if not properly implemented. Its vehicles were performing a “right hook” turn that put cyclists at serious risk — with the San Francisco Bike Coalition calling it “one of the primary causes of collisions between cars and people who bike resulting in serious injury or fatality.” Uber opted to keep its vehicles in circulation, to the alarm of cycling advocates, and had human drivers make the turn manually instead. Thankfully there were no reported injuries, and the trial was subsequently ended after the California DMV revoked the registrations of the vehicles because they didn’t have a licence for the tests. Self-driving cars aren’t a reason to stop supporting cyclists Peter Macdiarmid/Getty ImagesCyclists stage a ‘die-in’ protest in London to raise awareness of road safety. These technological challenges — while tricky — are all theoretically surmountable. Companies like Renault-Nissan say they want autonomous vehicles in commercial production by 2020. With over 50,000 cyclists injured in road accidents in America in 2014 (and another 21,000 in the UK), that date can’t come quickly enough. “There will a point where the number of accidents involving cars and cyclists will improve,” David Wynter said. “Only then will the public feel it is safer to commute in the cities.” However, Andreas Kambanis, from LondonCyclist.co.uk, cautions that self-driving vehicles will not be a panacea for everything currently wrong with cycling in cities — and must not be used as an excuse to slack on supporting cyclists in other ways.. “There is one big caveat to all of this. London’s roads are already heavily congested and polluted, more cars isn’t going to solve this problem, so the city must continue to invest in infrastructure that considers cyclists.” NOW WATCH: 5 hidden features only PlayStation 4 power users know about Follow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn Tagged In audi cycling google nutonomy self-driving cars uk Discuss Be the first to comment on this story!

Why the Yahoo hacker might not be interested in short-term profit Even if you only downloaded a handful of apps last year, do you remember what permissions you granted to each?  CBC's Marketplace recently tested how much personal information we can unknowingly hand over to apps. The start of new year is a time to reset —  and the perfect time to unlearn all of the bad privacy habits you may have picked up. Here are a few tips to get you started. Review your privacy settings Both Android and iPhone have a settings page where you can see which apps have access to everything from your heart rate to your home's lighting system. It's here that you can review which apps have access to what, and disable permissions you don't remember granting. Watch the Marketplace investigation Are Your Apps Spying On You? CBC AT CES | For new smart-home gadgets, the spectre of insecurity looms Apple even offers an option to reset all of your phone's privacy and security settings at once, so that the next time you open an app that needs access to your microphone, camera, or other data, it will ask for your permission as if you were just using the app for the first time. In terms of what apps can do, there are some differences between Android phones and iPhones to keep in mind. Apple, for example, doesn't allow developers to access the camera unless an app is open and in use, nor access iMessages or SMS messages. Stick to app stores Apple and Google maintain app stores where most people buy their apps. It's a way for the two companies to control what people can do on their platforms — for better and for worse. One benefit is that, as part of the app store review process, Apple and Google vet apps for potential security or privacy issues — essentially, screening out apps that would otherwise be classified as malware, or try to access user data in a way that violates their terms of service. Find out more about the Marketplace investigation this weekend, when CBC's Diana Swain explores the ethics of the app experiment on The Investigators Saturday at 9:30 p.m. ET and Sunday at 5:30 p.m. ET on CBC News Network. While you can disable the security settings on Android and iPhone that prevent you from downloading apps from other sources, you probably shouldn't unless you really know what you're doing. There's no one watching to make sure that app you got from a friend is really doing what it says it does. Do Google and Apple know where you've been? Both Android and iPhone provide a number of ways for apps to access your location — which you can check in your phone's privacy settings. But both Apple and Google also have their own location-tracking settings that are separate from third-party apps. CBC AT CES | Why everyone's talking to Amazon's virtual assistant Alexa On iPhones running iOS 7 and higher, there are a number of location-based tracking options under the "System Services" section of your phone's location privacy settings (pay close attention to the "Frequent Locations" setting in particular). On Android version 2.3 and up, you'll find "Google Location History" under your phone's "Location" settings. Apple and Google use your phone's location so their apps better understand the places you frequently visit, and for advertising purposes, but you can turn this off. Get yourself a password manager Writing down your passwords on a scrap of paper that you keep in your sock drawer is never a good idea. But storing all your passwords in a password manager is smart. Think of it is a digital vault, secured with one really long passphrase, that holds all your other passwords inside. Instead of having to remember a bunch of short, insecure passwords, you only have to remember a really long one instead. A good password manager won't just store your passwords, but will help you generate stronger, more secure passwords, too. Protect yourself with 2-factor authentication The best thing you can do to stop attackers from getting into your accounts with Facebook, Google, Twitter, Dropbox, and other services is to setup two-factor authentication. Each time you attempt to log in to an account protected by two-factor authentication from a new phone or computer, you'll be asked for the password you know, but also an additional, temporary password that you don't (that's the second factor). Why passthoughts could make passwords a thing of the past The idea is that this temporary password is generated by an app on your phone, or sent via text message — meaning that even if someone learns your password, they'll still need access to your phone to get into your account. Want to know what data your apps have collected? Ask! In Canada, there's legislation called the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), which "gives people a general right to access their personal information held by businesses subject to this law." In other words, if you want a record of all the information that your favourite emoji keyboard, banking app, or social network has stored about you, can send the company a letter and ask. The process might take a while — and there's no guarantee you'll get a response back, even if it is Canadian law — but it's a great way to exercise your right to privacy and learn just how much of your personal data is under a company's control.

 Self-driving cars could spark a cycling revolution Rob Price Jan. 7, 2017, 4:36 AM 7,237 facebook linkedin twitter email print The future's bright, cyclists say.

Together, it all adds up to potential massive improvement in safety — the kind that historically hadn't been possible without major urban redevelopment. By some estimates, self-driving cars could save 300,000 lives a decade in the United States alone. A cyclist passes an early Google self-driving car in 2012 Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Dr. Miklós Kiss, head of predevelopment piloted systems at Audi, thinks self-driving cars could be a boon to cyclists. It will "make it easier for cyclists because the behavior of automated cars will be more predictable than now," he told Business Insider. Many cyclists are equally enthusiastic. "If self-driving cars are proven safer for cyclists and pedestrians, cyclists would lay out the red carpet and welcome the revolution with both arms," Andreas Kambanis, founder of biking site LondonCyclist.co.uk, said. Here we go, here we go, here we go. Alex Livesey/Getty Images "Just under 50% of cyclist deaths on London's roads are caused by HGVs, so if the technology extended there, we'd immediately eliminate a huge danger." He added: "Beyond the safety aspect, self driving cars may also be more of a pleasure to drive around, as you wouldn't expect it to do something erratic or to drive aggressively. This may in turn mean more cyclists on the road as the roads will now feel safer." Eli Allalouf, a director at Alyo International, used to bike everywhere, he said. "But after my second bicycle were stolen and too many injuries cycling on the road I have given up ... I would love to have the ability to ride my bicycle every day to work but the risk is too high as I am a family man with kids and wife ... After a certain period of the fully automated cars I think there will be a huge spike in cycling." Accounting for cyclists isn't easy, say self-driving car companies However, engineers working on the technology say that learning to deal with cyclists is throwing up unique challenges. They're small, fast in urban environments, and nimble — but also relatively slow on open roads, and immensely vulnerable. "Cyclists are more dynamic than cars. The biggest challenge is to predict their future behavior and driving route. Cyclists can be found on the road and on sidewalks too. Compared to cars they are not limited to only one road space. Sometimes cyclists do not obey traffic rules completely (red light-violators, etc.)," Audi's Dr. Miklós Kiss said. "Cyclists need their own behavior prediction model as they behave differently to car drivers and pedestrians." Karl Iagnemma, CEO of autonomous tech startup Nutonomy, has encountered similar problems. "All autonomous vehicles under development today are being designed to detect and avoid cyclists. This requires that the sensing systems be specifically 'trained' to detect cyclists, and that the navigation systems be instructed how to maneuver in the presence of cyclists." Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn takes a particularly dim view, telling CNBC in January 2016 that "one of the biggest problems [for self-driving cars] is people with bicycles." Google's software can detect cyclists' hand signals and use them to figure out what the cyclist is planning to do next. Google "They don't respect any rules usually," he claimed. "The car is confused by them, because from time-to-time they behave like pedestrians and from time-to-time they behave like cars." Google, one of the most high-profile developers of the tech, isn't trash-talking cyclists — but recognises the difficulties they can pose. In its June 2016 progress report, Google's self-driving car team explained how its vehicles treat cyclists differently (and "conservatively") to other road users. "For example, when our sensors detect a parallel-parked car with an open door near a cyclist, our car is programmed to slow down or nudge over to give the rider enough space to move towards the center of the lane and avoid the door," the Google team wrote. "We also aim to give cyclists ample buffer room when we pass, and our cars won’t squeeze by when cyclists take the center of the lane, even if there’s technically enough space. Whether the road is too narrow or they’re making a turn, we respect this indication that cyclists want to claim their lane." And because cyclists don't have indicator lights, the technology has to predict cyclists' intentions another way: By reading their hand gestures using its in-built cameras. An Uber driverless Ford Fusion drives down Smallman Street on September, 22, 2016 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images Uber's self-driving car trials in December 2016 clearly illustrated the dangers the tech can pose to cyclists if not properly implemented. Its vehicles were performing a "right hook" turn that put cyclists at serious risk — with the San Francisco Bike Coalition calling it "one of the primary causes of collisions between cars and people who bike resulting in serious injury or fatality." Uber opted to keep its vehicles in circulation, to the alarm of cycling advocates, and had human drivers make the turn manually instead. Thankfully there were no reported injuries, and the trial was subsequently ended after the California DMV revoked the registrations of the vehicles because they didn't have a license for the tests. Self-driving cars aren't a reason to stop supporting cyclists Cyclists stage a "die-in" protest in London to raise awareness of road safety. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images These technological challenges — while tricky — are all theoretically surmountable. Companies like Renault-Nissan say they want autonomous vehicles in commercial production by 2020. With over 50,000 cyclists injured in road accidents in America in 2014 (and another 21,000 in the UK), that date can't come quickly enough. "There will a point where the number of accidents involving cars and cyclists will improve," David Wynter said. "Only then will the public feel it is safer to commute in the cities." However, Andreas Kambanis, from LondonCyclist.co.uk, cautions that self-driving vehicles will not be a panacea for everything currently wrong with cycling in cities — and must not be used as an excuse to slack on supporting cyclists in other ways.. "There is one big caveat to all of this. London's roads are already heavily congested and polluted, more cars isn't going to solve this problem, so the city must continue to invest in infrastructure that considers cyclists."

Social efforts in all shapes and forms, including messengers and the infamous Google+ have always been a weakpoint in the chain and the current situation isn't really that much better. Allo and Duo seem to be center-stage in the IM package Google is currently trying to push to end users. Thus, Hangouts' fate is still quite uncertain and while Google is sticking to its promise not to retire it, it is now clear that a major course readjustment is already underway. As part of that, the platform's API, or at least the part used by many third-party developers will be going down on April 25. Apparently, Google intends to use Hangouts as a specialized tool for meetings and market it for enterprise use. At the Google Horizon event in September 2016, we previewed a new experience for Hangouts focused on meetings. In order to streamline our efforts further, we will be retiring the Google+ Hangouts API that enables developers to build apps for the older version of Hangouts video calls. This API was originally intended to support social scenarios for consumer users as part of Google+, whereas Hangouts is now turning to focus on enterprise use cases. However, not all third-party solutions are getting axed. For example, the DialPad and RingCentral apps, which are used to dial into a Hangouts session from a phone will remain functional. Naturally, Google's own Toolbox, Control Room and Cameraman, intended for Hangouts on Air broadcasting will be fine too. Interestingly enough, the popular Slack enterprise communication tool will be spared as well. It is also worth noting, that if Google keeps the Hangouts web interfaces alive in any convenient form, various web-based tools, like the Franz IM aggregator should also slip through the cracks.

It is widely believed that Fleming missing a train in Ireland due to a mistake printed in a timetable ultimately led to his brilliant idea that altered time as we know it. Fleming was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, in 1827. This was a period when regions used solar time to set their own clocks. Solar time worked well enough until trains came along and the need for standardised time arose. Following his missed train in 1876, Fleming proposed a worldwide standard time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February, 8, 1879. He advocated for dividing the world into 24 time zones beginning at the Greenwich Meridian and spaced at 15 degree intervals. His proposal gave way to the International Prime Meridian Conference which convened in 1884 and was attended by 25 nations. It was here that Fleming’s system of international standard time was adopted. Fleming was also known for helping build the Intercontinental Railway, serving as chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and designing Canada’s first postage stamp.

Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp to Ford Motor Co unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co, which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,” he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company’s Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. “It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services,” he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. “A huge part of an assistant is search,” he said. “Google is a search company. Amazon is not.” SEARCH More from Sify: gold rate silver rate   Cities   Price (10g)   Gold Rate in Chennai   Rs. 26820.00 (0%)   Gold Rate in Mumbai   Rs. 27170.00 (0.93%)   Gold Rate in Delhi   Rs. 26900.00 (0%)   Gold Rate in Kolkata   Rs. 26290.00 (0%)   Gold Rate in Kerala   Rs. 25850.00 (0%)   Gold Rate in Bangalore   Rs. 26250.00 (0.57%)   Gold Rate in Hyderabad   Rs. 26920.00 (0.37%) more   Cities   Price (1 kg)   Silver Rate in Chennai   Rs. 39345.00 (-0.01%)   Silver Rate in Mumbai   Rs. 39345.00 (-0.01%)   Silver Rate in Delhi   Rs. 39345.00 (-0.01%)   Silver Rate in Kolkata   Rs. 39345.00 (-0.01%)   Silver Rate in Kerala   Rs. 39345.00 (-0.01%) more talking point on sify finance About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

This home might be smarter than you Google recently published its list of most frequently searched keywords and questions of 2016. Last year, it seems that the location of the Indonesian island of Bali has been a subject of particular interest among American Web users. Google has revealed the top 10 travel questions most frequently asked by American users. Coming top of the list, the geographical location of Bali – a Hindu island found between the islands of Java and Lombok in the Indonesian archipelago – appears to have piqued the interest of web users in the United States. In fourth place, “Where is Corfu” proved another popular question for American travellers last year. A trendy European destination in 2016, the Greek island is located in the Ionian Sea, unlike other well-known island hotspots like Santorini. Pontikonisi in Corfu, Greece. Where is Corfu was the fourth most-asked question on Google last year. Photo: AFP The location of Bora Bora, in French Polynesia (sixth), and the Grand Canyon (10th) complete the list of geography-based travel questions. Other questions in the top 10 focus on activities within the United States. Las Vegas is clearly still a destination that interests many US travellers, with “what to do” in Sin City proving the second most frequently asked question.Similarly, tourists were looking out for things to do in San Francisco (third), Orlando (fifth) and Miami (seventh).

Home Industry Technology Google Doodle pays tribute to Sir Sandford Fleming: Here is why he invented worldwide standard time zones Google Doodle pays tribute to Sir Sandford Fleming: Here is why he invented worldwide standard time zones Google celebrated Sir Sandford Fleming's 190th birth anniversary on Saturday dedicating the Google doodle art to the inventor if the standard time zones. By: FE Online | Published: January 7, 2017 11:24 AM Before Sir Sandford Fleming had come around with the idea for a standardised time zone, different regions had been mainly dependent on the solar time. Google celebrated Sir Sandford Fleming’s 190th birth anniversary on Saturday dedicating the Google doodle art to the inventor if the standard time zones. Fleming was a Scottish-born Canadian inventor and engineer and was the first known person to propose the standard time in 1879. In 1884, Fleming’s idea had been adapted by 25 countries. Before Fleming had come around with the idea for a standardised time zone, different regions had been mainly dependent on the solar time. It is widely said that Fleming came up with the idea after he had missed a train in Ireland due to conflicting time zones affecting the scheduling of the trains. Fleming had first presented the idea of a standard time on February 8, 1879, at the Royal Canadian Institute. The introduction of four time zones began on November 18, 1883. The exact time was majorly decided y another new technology that had taken the industrial revolution by storm-the telegraph. In 1884, following Fleming’s proposal, the ITC established a plan for the different time zones, including the International Date Line. And thus began two of the biggest inventions of the Industrial revolution- wristwatches and standard time. With the new idea, that would eventually set the world into a definitive motion, Fleming spoke about diving the time into 24 time zones starting at the Greenwich Meridian, spaced at 15 degree intervals. The proposal was formally adopted at the International Prime Meridian Conference, 1884 where 25 countries agreed to it. Before Fleming, solar time was widely used until the times, the railways became a normal feature in the world raising the need for a standardised time, The introduction of synchronised clocks was also known to help in weather forecasting. After Fleming’s proposal in 1884 at the IPMC, the Greenwich Mean Time was introduced cord Britain in 1847. Also in News: Fleming was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland and became an apprentice surveyor at the age of 14, following which he travelled to Canada in 1845 with his brother at the age of 18. It was there that he founded the RCI in 1849, which later became a renowned centre completely dedicated to the advancement of science. Fleming, following his stint in Canada where he invented the Standardised Time Zones, was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1897. He died at the age of 88 at his daughter’s home in Halifax on July 22, 1915. Please Wait while comments are loading...

At the moment, the only option is to turn on notifications for Google’s homepage doodles, but nevertheless is quite notable for how high-level it is. On the majority of Android devices, the Notifications page is now the very first item at the top of Settings, ranking over Search and Home screen. Meanwhile, the setting is listed under Google Assistant on the Pixel. A toggle to turn on notifications for “New Doodle games, videos, and interactive experiences” is currently the only setting. By default, it set to off and requires enabling on each device. With doodles often marking both major events and others that are less well known, Google might have a way to highlight important things that would otherwise miss people’s attentions. Despite the high level status of the new pane, notifications for Feed — previously Google Now — cards still remain in the “Your feed” page. This inconsistency could be confusing for new users as the Feed frequently sends notifications for drastic temperature and weather changes, sport scores, major news alerts, and more that direct users back to the Google app. The new Notification settings page is currently being rolled out server-side to recent versions of the Google app. It does not appear to be limited to the current beta version (6.10).

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile CEO John Legere makes his predictions for 2017 T-Mobile CEO John Legere makes his predictions for 2017 January 6, 2017 Alex Wagner 40 Comments It’s the start of a new year, and just like he has the past couple of years, T-Mobile CEO John Legere has laid out his predictions for the coming 12 months. Legere’s first prediction for 2017 is that cable companies will try to enter wireless through MVNO deals, but that they’ll fail. Legere adds that because of this, T-Mobile will not get into any MVNO deals with cable companies. Cable companies are the only ones that’ll try to get into wireless in 2017, Legere suggests, as he thinks that “a MAJOR new player will jump in and shake up US wireless in a MAJOR way.” The T-Mo CEO specifically guesses that Google will “go for the mobile moonshot.” Google offers wireless service through Project Fi, which runs on the T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular networks, but Legere appears to think that Google will take things a step farther in 2017. Sticking with the topic of other companies, Legere thinks that Dish will be no more this year after it missed its opportunity to enter wireless using its supply of spectrum. Moving on to television shows, Legere predicts that the majority of TV watching will happen on mobile by the end of 2017. More than one-third of TV viewing happens on something other than a TV, Legere says, with that number jumping to 50 percent for people under 25. And T-Mo’s CEO expects those numbers to continue to grow. The second TV-related prediction from Legere is that content built for OTT and mobile consumption, like his Slow Cooker Sunday show, will pass cable channels in number of viewers. Specifically, Legere thinks that his Slow Cooker Sunday show will get a weekly audience of 1 million viewers by the end of 2017. The show currently pulls in more than 500,000 viewers each week. Rounding out John’s 2017 predictions are gigabit LTE speeds, which T-Mobile touts that it’s nearly achieved in lab testing; a wireless CEO shuffle that’ll see three of the four current CEOs exiting their positions this year; and merger discussions between Verizon and Comcast as a way to help Comcast get into wireless. While John didn’t make any specific predictions about T-Mobile’s network, it seems likely that T-Mo will continue to build out its LTE coverage in 2017. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said yesterday that T-Mo plans to cover 320 million POPs with LTE in 2017, up from the 313 million covered at the end of 2016. Ray also said that T-Mobile currently reaches 251 million people with its Extended Range LTE coverage and that that number will grow in the first half of 2017. So what do you think of all these predictions? Do you have any that you’d like to add?

The prospect of that being the year end coverage map is so very exciting! Mark Kendrick I’m amazed myself by the improvement in their network in just the last year. I tried TMO last year for a couple of months but bailed because the service wasn’t very good, a year later and I’m quite satisfied Edward Ward Over the past year I have seen my coverage improve tremendously, to the point where I now have coverage on par with my wife who is Verizon loyal. Jason Caprio Those are some nice coverage predictions. I’ll believe it when I see it. I hope to see the day when T-Mobile ties/beats Verizon in rootmetrics, then I’ll switch back! I’m rooting for T-Mobile all the way! Cellphone Chris The cable MVNO thing isn’t a prediction, it’s already been announced. Those that know what I’m talking about understand that a merger between Verizon and Comcast seems highly unlikely. a d00d With Republicans in control of all 3 houses (Capitol Hill House, Senate, and White House), this merger is very much a possibility. In fact, depending on how fast they change things, I could even call it certain. Evil attracts Evil, after all. And I wonder how many board members are shared? Of course, we’ll all suffer for it, along with a TMo merger, but that’s the way it goes. At least we should be rid of Obamacare… Acdc1a We have no idea what is to come. A Republican wasn’t elected President, a populist was. If popular opinion is against the idea, it doesn’t go through. If it’s well sold to the public, it will. Linx I can’t see myself on any other carrier than T-Mobile right now. Richard Roma That’s interesting, I’m on the opposite end where I feel like evaluating other options. I don’t like this One only push at all. Jay Holm This coming April I will have been with T-Mobile for 4 full years. Very happy customer. Walt Get ride of the 3G hspa and use that spectrum for LTE. Keep 2G edge for all the flip phones and m2m Andrew Singleton keeping any 2g is a horrible idea. tmo’s new flip phone is LTE. a d00d Andrew, you need to re-read about IoT in the article earlier in the week. Walt, the problem is that many of the IoT resellers have been nudging these guys onto 3G as a cheaper measure than going directly to LTE as most companies only think of the short haul (bottom line for this quarter or year only) versus the long haul (let someone else pay for it). Plus there are a huge number of 3G handsets still in use, especially from other, poorer countries or rural carriers in this one who refuse to upgrade, likely because they can’t afford it. 2G will be with us a few more years, and 3G probably until the mid 2020’s at the earliest. Then again, with some of the fancy on-the-fly spectrum shuffling these new software-defined radio systems can do, it has been pointed out by others that, at least in an advanced network like TMo’s, they may NEVER go away completely! Nobody Special I predict after January 22nd @ The deadline for simple choice subscribers to switch to t-mobile one and get the tax included deal …. t-mobile will come up with a new incentive to trick the remaining simple choice subscribers to come to the darkside “T-Mobile One”…. the saga continues. nearvanaman I sort of rolled my eyes at T-Mo One because I typically use 1.5 to 3.0 gigs a month. But my 6GB plan, with taxes, costs me $75 a month. This “new” T-Mo One incentive will cost me a maximum of $70 and, sometimes, $60. I know the point is to get people on to the One plan and it’s hard to see a downside of doing this if they are never going to offer tiered plans again. Acdc1a For you it’s a no-brainer. I have 5 lines on ONE and Leger is right, it’s nice not to try to count GB. AJ2 What Tmo has failed to realize with the Tmo One plans is that most people still use 2gb or less. The $10 ‘back’ is a nice marekting ploy that I guess will make the plan a $60. If you use a Nexus or Pixel, Project Fi would still be cheaper. I see all these ads for $40 a line but thats only if you buy 4 lines. If they’d offer something for single customers, Id give Tmobile a try again as its the only one of the big 4 Ive ever had before switching to MVNOs. I dont care about a free Subway sandwich or some coupon to a product Idont want. If you can give a family of 4 free lines, you surely can do a promotion to offer single people a break Jay Holm If all people use is 2GB’s or less, what is the point in have a $500-$700+ smartphone? That’s like having a $20k car and driving lessons than 20 miles total per day, if I go no where but to work and back home that would be nearly 26 miles total in one day. I just don’t understand what the purpose is having a $500-$700 device and only use a measly 2gigs in a 30 day period. John Doe I don’t think Dish will end in 2017. They have Sling TV and Charlie Ergen isn’t a stupid guy so maybe I doubt it will disappear in 2017 that is too soon. I think John hopes that Dish will disappear so he can get his hands on their spectrum LoL (Oh that is right they have spectrum they can sell if things get bad for Dish) a d00d I don’t know if it was a mis-quote or not as I didn’t watch the video or whatever, but I think he meant Dish as a potential wireless competitor. The FCC has repeatedly warned them that they have never complied with their rules regarding build-out time after purchasing spectrum. That is, Dish is a Spectrum Squatter, the wireless version of a Domain Squatter, and, even under a new right-wing admin, I think the FCC may have finally had enough. Consider they let Globalstar use their little block of spectrum for limited terrestrial use after they’ve been begging for years. OTOH, Ergen has been squatting on a boat-load of spectrum with no network for years despite FCC pressure to sell or build. I for one truly hope that the FCC finally drops the hammer. QWR At CES, Legere actually said something to the effect that delivery of satellite-based content is dead, and so Dish will be dead as well. IMO he was not talking about Dish as a wireless provider. As far as the FCC goes, they have very little interest in going after Ergen for squatting since they turned him down for buying anyone on the cheap in 2015. He attempted to put it to use, and has until sometime this year to sell or lease 50% of his spectrum, even though it’s transmission properties are more suited for large amounts of data vs. speed. BadBatz 1. How about “predicting” some bonuses, freebies, incentives, etc. for long time subscribers to T-Mobile… The siren song of AT&T is calling… And Project Fi is taking already a lot of my business away from T-Mob… 2. Bandwidth… Need more bandwidth… How about more bandwidth… No more bandwidth, no more wireless watching of anything, Mr. Legere. And rural coverage… 3. Please, Mr. Legere, “predict” better international coverage for “free data roaming” and 20 cent voice calls. Some initiatives notwithstanding (Europe higher speed data for example) international roaming has become a sad joke: data throttled to the point of being unusable (64 kbps in may places), inability to dial out to many countries whilst roaming, etc. Even the T-Mobile app no workee in may places… Please “predict” improvements or just “predict” going back to the sate of int’l roaming from 2015… marque2 Project To always seemed really expensive to me. $10 per gig, wow. AJ2 Id switch to Tmobile if it had a less expensive plan for single customers, especially people that dont use 10-20 gb of data. Left Tmo years ago – First went to Straight Talk for their $45 5gb LTE plan and now on Fi where my bills are tiny. If Im not mistaken, with their new $10 rebate, the lowest plan is $60 if you use less than 2gb. Even getting paid $150 to switch doesnt make it worth it. Expert go with tmobile prepaid BadBatz If you don’t use gobs of data stay with Fi. For email, news, maps/navigation, etc. my total monthly bill is seldom over $30. Fi prefers T-Mobile anyway, even whilst roaming abroad the US endpoint is a T-Mobile IP in Texas, but connects to other networks stateside if T-Mobile is not available. Besides, laptop tethering doesn’t cost extra, roaming data is at full speed and it roams in some countries where T-Mobile does not. And Fi forwards calls AND text messages – the latter priceless if you use multiple phones. I have no idea what will become of Project Fi but for now I’m happy to have “Google talk” in my pocket :-) marque2 T-Mobile offered full speed tethering with its older plans. And I believe low speed tethering is included in Europe. Europe is way behind going to LTE, so high speed is also.lst impossible anyway. Jay Holm Since you use “so little data”, why even have a smartphone? Seriously! What a waste of money for someone who doesn’t even use their smartphone! marque2 Agreed, he can get a flip phone and 350 minutes of monthly service for $9 a month. Aleks I always knew that Google would enter the fray with a wireless service of their own. For John Legere to make this prediction, tells me that Google and T-Mobile could be looking at a merger, which to me, is the whole purpose of Google entering the wireless business sector. It’s been discussed behind closed doors. If this indeed does happen, look for wireless to be much cheaper and faster as Google is known to keep things affordable for the masses. Don’t take my word for it but if you’re on a legacy T-Mobile plan right now and ggrandfathered in, consider yourself lucky as they will be a major player in the wireless industry for the foreseeable future. I’m looking at Google and T-Mobile to work together and pave the way for the future. But like I said, don’t take my word for it. Just see it happening from a business standpoint. marque2 Google is evil. It will be a sad day when they take over TM. Nearmsp I would like to know what percentage of interstate freeways and state highways are covered rather than the million population. We just do not talk when we are in population centers. We talk while get from point A to point B and we could travel through places with no population on the way out of one city to another. This is the reason why people go for AT&T and Verizon. Coverage outside of major cities should be a goal of T-mobile. Currently I carry a a Verizon myfi and switch on as soon as leave the metro area to be able to do wi-fi calling. T-mobile coverage outside cities still sucks. It has improved much but a long way to go. KeepU You don’t happen to do much of that rural driving in West Virginia or between I-35 and I-5 do you? I drive a truck, and those are the only places I find a big difference in coverage between my t-mobile and verizon coverage. marque2 He doesn’t do much rural driving in his apparent state of Texas. Or never uses the phone while driving. Jay Holm I’ve driven from Houston to Laredo, from Houston to Dallas, from Houston to Longview. . .never lost signal in between any of these places. marque2 Try Midland to El Paso. No coverage for 200 miles when I last drove it. Try driving I-40 in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. I have a fairly new 5x as well. Parts of I15 in CA. Shouldn’t have problems with the new bands. And once the interstates are covered major highways should be next 395 and 78 “Ortega highway” comes to mind. I know TM is small and is trying hard to cover more, bit to claim no issues while travelling is false. Also note San Diego has major holes in Oceanside, Carlsbad, parts of Coronado and San Diego bay. They haven’t put Band 12 in San Diego yet. KeepU I predict the low grade billing fraud will continue, as will the network build out, and despite it’s serious flaws T-mobile will continue to be the least bad of the major wireless providers. QWR Nice hat. Did you get a free bowl of soup with it? And Dish would like to officially declare that you cut your hair this year. Steven Prediction, T-Mobile will continue to ignore the Alabama and Florida Gulf Coast by not issuing the much needed Extended Range LTE.

Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google’s Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. Virtual reality seeks momentum at CES gadget gala While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android manufacturer, has yet to sign on. “Google’s ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days,” he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. “This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Erik Hermanson, Asus’s head of marketing for mobile products, said at the show. But mainstream consumer interest in the technology remains largely unproven. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google’s technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said. Google Earth now lets you explore whole wide world in virtual reality “We are waiting for app developers to really use the platform for what it’s for,” Amit Singh, a vice president for VR at Google, told reporters. In addition to supporting Daydream, Huawei said that it is exploring opportunities for Tango with Google. The Asus phone became the first to support both technologies. Google has stressed that the programs do not overlap for now, but by pursuing both, the company can position itself for success regardless of whether AR or VR becomes a mainstream hit. “By having options for both, they can cover the full potential market,” said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Google-Google+ Amazon-Amazon+ Huawei-Huawei+ CES2017-CES2017+ Sure, Alexa has been the voice activated personal assistant on Amazon Echo devices, but is it ready to handle tasks barked at it by phone users? Huawei announced at CES this week that the U.S. version of its next flagship phone will include an app that connects to Alexa. This has some analysts believing that Google is going to have to fight before it is no longer the most popular digital assistant on Android. Google does have its Google Assistant, which allows users to engage in a more conversational dialogue with the virtual assistant. Google Assistant is available on the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL, Google's messaging app Allo, and will be featured om NVIDIA's upcoming Shield television. Alexa will soon be used by various companies in their consumer products. That list includes Ford and Whirlpool, who will use the cloud based service in new cars and appliances respectively.   "To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue."-Jan Dawson, analyst, Jackdaw Research Alexa and Google are also going at each other inside homes with smart speakers made by both firms. Amazon has the Echo which competes with the Google Home. Both answer questions, handle tasks, and can control smart home appliances among their multitude of capabilities. Microsoft is joining this club with a smart speaker powered by its personal assistant Cortana. This device will try to differentiate itself from the competition by shipping with Harman Kardon speakers. source: Reuters Verizon has 5G equipment deployed in 10 cities 06 Jan Prev news Taking a quick look at LG's answer to the AirPods with the Tone Free 06 Jan Next news Close newer posts Intel has nearly completed a 5G modem with 5Gbps download speeds 06 Jan Whet your appetite for Sony's upcoming noise-canceling wireless headphones 06 Jan Record 63 billion WhatsApp messages sent on New Year's Eve 06 Jan Taking a quick look at LG's answer to the AirPods with the Tone Free 06 Jan Now reading: Amazon's Alexa to be found on the next Android powered Huawei flagship phone in the U.S. Amazon's Alexa to be found on the next Android powered Huawei flagship 06 Jan Verizon has 5G equipment deployed in 10 cities 06 Jan LG to sustain its first quarterly operating loss since 2010, mobile and 06 Jan Samsung Galaxy A3 & Galaxy A5 (2017) hands-on and up close from CES 2017 06 Jan A quick hands on with the 2017 version of the budget-friendly LG K10 06 Jan Moto Z phones support Google's VR platform Daydream 06 Jan older posts Featured stories   LG promises that the LG G6 cell will stay cool   Andy Rubin, the father of Android, plans to launch a bezel-less smartphone   HTC U Ultra specs review   HTC U Ultra vs U Play: what are the differences?   Your WhatsApp messages can easily be spied on, and Facebook knows it   HTC U Play is official: a 5.2-inch mid-ranger with HTC's Sense Companion aboard 8 Comments Follow Following Options Close Always view all comments Show comments: default hide low rated show moderated comments Display mode: Threaded Chronological Newest first Save posted on 06 Jan 2017, 20:41 2 Reply 1. meanestgenius (Posts: 13704; Member since: 28 May 2014) This is awesome news.

But in addition to high-profile pork such as the Alaskan “Bridge to Nowhere,” this waste comes in more subtle forms, too — as an endless stream of bureaucratic nonsense needlessly jacks up the cost of countless federal projects. Case in point: The U.S. Department of Labor’s current lawsuit with Google. For the past decade, The Associated Press reports, internet giant Google has received a series of advertising and cloud computing contracts from the feds, including a current $1.2 million deal to place digital ads on behalf of the government. But in a lawsuit filed last week, the Labor Department is attempting to bar Google from doing further business with Washington unless the company turns over confidential information about thousands of its employees. As a federal contractor with more than $10,000 in business, Google must comply with specific rules against racial or religious discrimination, the AP notes, as well as cooperate with audits in order to make sure that it is complying with those rules. The lawsuit doesn’t accuse Google of engaging in discrimination, only that the company dragged its feet in complying with a September 2015 request for records involving employee compensation, job histories, contracts and other information. Google refuses to produce the data for privacy reasons. Do companies that receive government contracts deserve scrutiny? Absolutely. But the growing list of mandates that companies such as Google and others face can range from needlessly burdensome to downright ridiculous. For instance, the government demands that the disabled constitute 7 percent of any contractor’s workforce or the company risks financial penalties or the loss of the work. A similar requirement calls for an 8 percent hiring target for veterans. Other micro-management mandates call for companies to disclose information about their greenhouse gas emissions, set targets for reducing their carbon footprints and compile yearly reports on a number of issues. While these regulations are certainly well-intentioned in most cases, they add tremendous costs to companies doing work for the federal government, driving up taxpayer costs and imposing massive inefficiences. In Google’s case, they amount to a thinly veiled fishing expedition designed to support a potential investigation into the successful company’s hiring practices. President-elect Trump likes to tout his deal-making abilities. Perhaps, once in office, he can try to strike a better, healthier deal between the federal government and its contractors by paring back all this red tape.

Nathan Ingraham, @nateingraham 01.04.17 in Internet Comments 373 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Google has talked about bringing its AI assistant to as many places as possible since it was revealed at the company's I/O developer conference back in May. Right now, it's in the Pixel smartphone, Google Home device and the Allo chat app. Today, Google announced that its next destination will be Android TV devices, including the new NVIDIA Shield (as NVIDIA just confirmed at its CES press conference). Android TV hasn't really taken off as a platform to any real degree, but for those out there using it, this will be a nice upgrade. It sounds like it'll work just as you'd expect: You can ask it questions from Google, get details on your calendar, find out the weather, ask how long your commute is and so forth. Naturally, too, you'll be able to ask it to play video. Just as Google Home ties into Chromecast devices to let you tell it to play videos, the Assistant on Android TV will do the same. However, Android TV had pretty solid voice control from the start, so this isn't quite as big a deal. But Google's voice processing has undoubtedly improved, and the Assistant's conversational nature should make it easier to use than what's currently built into the Android TV platform. As for which devices will get this update, Google says it'll come to any Android TV device that can run Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat. That includes the just-announced Dish AirTV Player, Sharp's Aquos TVs, Sony Bravia TVs and the Xiaomi Mi Box. And the new NVIDIA Shield will work hands-free, which means you can really just talk to it like you can to Google Home, without having to press a remote button to activate the feature. Sadly, there's no word on when this software update will roll out, but in the meantime, we're going to try and check out the Assistant on some Android TV devices here at CES.Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.

Name: Subject: Message: Most apps that use Google Hangouts API will shut down in April Android Development Apps & Games Newsby John Callaham1 week ago 53 1246 164 While Google has stated many times that it has no plans to shut down its Hangouts messaging service, it has decided to end support for its third-party developer tools. The company has quietly updated its FAQ for the Google Hangouts API, stating that no new apps will be allow to access those tools. See also: Best texting apps and SMS apps for Android 2 weeks ago In addition, most of the existing apps that are currently using the Google Hangouts API will no longer work after April 25. There will be a few exceptions, which will include Google’s own Hangouts on Air broadcasting tools like Toolbox, Control Room, and Cameraman, along with business and enterprise oriented apps like Slack that integrate with the API. Finally, apps that support dialing into a call like DialPad and RingCentral will also be allowed to use the API after the expiration date. In 2016, Google launched new messaging apps like Allo and Duo, and the company has now begun pre-installing Duo on new Android devices, replacing Hangouts. However, both Duo and Allo are currently mobile-only apps, while Hangouts also has PC desktop support, along with deep integrations with other services like Gmail and Google Docs. That makes Hangouts better for its many business and enterprise customers, which Google still wants to support.

  You are here: Home > Business > Technology, Media and Telecom Baidu puts a Chinese spin on family robots 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China Daily, January 7, 2017 Adjust font size: A family robot at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang in November. [Photo/China Daily]  Chinese internet colossus Baidu is out to make a splash with "Little Fish", a family robot that is a voice-controlled virtual valet akin to Amazon Echo or Google Home. Baidu showed off "Little Fish", a translation of its Chinese name Xiaoyu Zaijia, on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas ahead of its release in China later this year. "I think 2017 will be the year of conversational computing," Baidu chief scientist Andrew Ng said while demonstrating the robot. "We see a clear path of it changing everything." Using the human voice to interact with computers that are able to essentially learn from experience was among the hot trends at the show. Arrays of device makers added digital aide capabilities with the help of Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant technology. Unlike "faceless" Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices that rely on people asking for information or controlling devices by speaking, Little Fish also features a touch-screen on top of its orb-shaped base. A camera on top tracks faces, and the screen swivels to keep facing a speaker. "Speech is the fastest way for you to communicate with a computer, but a screen is a very fast way for a machine to communicate with you," Ng said. For example, it would be quicker to glance at a requested list of top restaurants from Yelp than it would be to listen to the computer read all the names and descriptions, he said. "Little Fish" uses Baidu's operating system DuerOS, which is already employed by other devices in China, such as set-top TV boxes that can switch channels by voice command or figure out names of actors on screen when asked. "It will transform how you use devices in your home. There are plenty of business models," Ng said. Baidu partnered with hardware firm Ainemo to build the second-generation device. "We believe family robots will be the next big category that will be a member of everybody's home," Ainemo CEO Chenfeng Song said. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is getting a foothold in homes, with developers feverishly adding "skills" to Amazon Echo speakers infused with Alexa. Google, meanwhile, is using its AI prowess in Android smartphones, messaging software, and a vase-sized Home digital assistant. The home hubs, sometimes referred to as smart speakers, fetch content or answers from the internet, and can act as remote controls for other devices in houses. Chinese tech giant Huawei said at the trade show that it is adding Amazon's Alexa to its flagship smartphone for its US launch. Lenovo announced it was launching a smart home assistant powered by Alexa, joining the growing roster of contenders in voice-activated devices. Experts expect voice technology to quickly improve, within years perhaps even being able to recognize speakers so accurately it could be used for biometric security.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google acquires Limes Audio for its G Suite By Ida Torres - January 6, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter When it comes to video conference calls, even if you have top-notch video quality, when the audio is bad, it practically defeats the purpose. Google knows how important sound is to businesses that regularly hold these types of calls. One thing they’ve done is to acquire Limes Audio, a company that specializes in creating technology to enhance voice communication systems. G Suite customers will soon be able to enjoy the benefits of having better sounding video conference calls. G Suite uses several video conferencing solutions like Chromebox for Meetings and Google Hangouts. And while they probably have pretty decent audio already, Google believes it’s extremely important to bring “great audio experience”. This is especially important for companies that let their employees tele-commute or who have offices or customers located in different cities or even countries. Low-cost, high quality audio is critical for these kinds of communications, whether it’s video or just normal audio conference calls. Limes Audio has been a solid name when it comes to creating innovations in the voice communication systems. They have come up with solutions that eliminate distracting background noise, distortion and echoes that can actually adversely affect these online video and telephony meetings. Google hasn’t yet announced whatever it is that Limes Audio will be adding to G Suites and other Google solutions, except to say that they are excited to work closely with the team they’re acquiring to bring the “best online voice quality” that will be available in the market.

Launches Reviews Cars Motorcycles Scooters EV Commercial Mercedes Benz to get smarter with Google Home by sourabhon January 7, 2017No Comments Mercedes-Benz today announced the integration of the Google Assistant on Google Home. Mercedes-Benz Home Automation with Google Home Google Home, a voice-activated personal assistant, makes it possible to interact with the Mercedes-Benz vehicle from home. The feature will be available to Mercedes-Benz customers in 2017. Collaborating with Google on Google Home is a part of Mercedes’ effort to make smarter cars. With the Google Home integration, customers can now set destination in the car, set and activate heating and cooling systems within their vehicles; find out fuel and charge levels; check lock status as well as interact with their cars in order to lock doors from the comfort of their home. “In the last decade, we’ve seen a range of benefits when smart technology is combined with transportation,” said Sajjad Khan, vice president of digital vehicle & mobility at Daimler. “This newest integration shows just how intelligent the car of the future will be, and we plan to roll out more applications as the year progresses that will make daily life even more accessible and convenient.” Mercedes-Benz is one of the first Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to combine the Google Assistant on Google Home with their vehicles. The collaboration with the Google Assistant is part of Mercedes-Benz long-term goal of creating an intelligent ecosystem around cars. With the future heading towards an intelligent interaction between the customer’s Internet of Things (IoT)/Wearables devices and their cars, this might become a standard feature in the years to come. Mercedes-Benz launched the Companion App in 2015 to integrate contextual intelligence into customers’ driving experience. In addition to door-to-door navigation, the Companion App uses machine learning to provide a personalised user experience by learning from customers’ actions and their environment. It extends customers’ existing behaviour on their mobile phone seamlessly into Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The new system will arrive in specific markets from as early as this year.

It’s one of the most popular and top-grossing games on both Android and iOS, and with good reason. It’s extremely fun and very addicting. However, occasionally users run into problems, want to change their name, or transfer their village to a new device or from Android to iPhone. Advertisement We get asked a lot of questions about Clash. From transferring the game from an iPhone to an Android tablet, switching phones, connection problems, lost villages and more. There are countless problems that can easily be fixed, or otherwise solved with the help of Clash of Clans support. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Typically users don’t run into actual in-game problems, and most of the questions being asked in forums are about changing phones and such. However, there are still occasional bugs or problems you could face. The first stop for users is the official Clash of Clans support forum, or continue on for more details regarding everything mentioned above and more. Advertisement Advertisement With millions and millions of players on both Android and iOS, this game has its share of problems. The biggest concern for most comes from a lost village, which is why we’ll start with always backing up your Clash of Clans account and village on Android or iOS. This can be done with Game Center, or Google+ on both platforms. How to Backup Clash of Clans First things first, gamers should always tie Clash of Clans to either Game Center on iPhone and iPad, or use Google+ and Google Games on Android. This is a crucial step that ties the game to your Apple ID or Gmail in case of loss, theft, damage to a device, or other situations. Start by opening Clash of Clans and hitting the settings button, which are three gear-shaped icons in a box near the bottom right. This is the main settings menu. In the middle and bottom is the important stuff. From transferring the game to another device, connecting to Facebook, or tying your game to Google or Apple’s Game Center. Click the bottom middle option and connect to Google Play, or the bottom for Game Center. This ensures you’ll always be able to recover your game. I’ve connected to Google+ with my gmail account. No matter what Android device I have, I can download Clash of Clans, connect to Google, and it will automatically transfer my entire village in seconds. I have the same village on more than one phone, and two different Android tablets. Advertisement Read: Clash of Clans December 2015 Update: Donate Spells & More The same goes for Game Center. Simply connect to game center at the bottom of this settings screen, which will instantly connect Clash to that iOS device. With Android users can simply transfer the entire village with Google+, but iOS requires Game Center and using a link code. The bottom left is where you’ll need to click to connect to Game Center This is the first step all users should take, to ensure they’ll never lose a village. If this isn’t done, Supercell might be able to recover a village if you know the email account, name, clan name and other information, but it could take days or weeks to be recovered. How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Whether it’s on Android or iOS, the process of transferring the game is rather easy. With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code. However, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code, or write it down. It’s crucial that you follow the first step mentioned above, and sign into Game Center or Google+ on your current device first before trying to transfer the game. Better safe than sorry. Advertisement With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans village to a new device (phone or tablet) couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, go through the tutorial, then follow the steps from the video below. Simply connect and sign into Google+ inside the game and it transfers the data over. The process is slightly different with iOS, and users will need to use Game Center and the “link a device” code button shown at the end of the video, or in the screenshot below. Tap this to get started. Advertisement With iPhone or iPad you’ll need the old device and the new one, which can be a problem if a device is lost or stolen. If so, contact Supercell for further assistance. On iOS hit settings > Link a device > and tap “this is the OLD DEVICE“. Clash will generate a code for you. Leave this on the screen, write it down, or take a screenshot. Do not lose it. Download Clash of Clans on your new iPhone or iPad, follow the same steps as above, but click “this is the NEW DEVICE” and enter the code. Sign into Game Center, and Clash will transfer to your new iOS device. It’s worth mentioning that if you download Clash on a new device and buy gems, or progress past Town Hall level 4, you can’t transfer your old game data. Meaning you’ll have to uninstall and reinstall the game, then try the transfer. So don’t play at all, and just follow the steps above to transfer an old village. If you try to transfer a village but your Gmail is tied to the wrong one, make a new Google account and re-connect it. Head to settings > accounts > add account > Google and make a new Google account. Then open Clash, and sync your current game to a new Google account. Then try again on your new device, and it should load the right village. Find a Lost Village If you have lost your Clash of Clans account or village by losing a phone, getting it stolen, broke, uninstalling the game or doing a factory data reset and did not have it backed up, only the support team can help you. Start the game, hit settings, and press “Help & Support” to get started. Users can also proceed by contacting Clash of Clans support here. Head to Help & Support, and tap the “Start a conversation” button on the top right. This will connect you with Supercell support, and they can try and track down and find your lost account. Having a unique name makes this easier. The following information will be needed to find a lost village: Name of the lost village Name of the clan the lost village is a part of (to help track it down) Town Hall level of your lost village Last date & time played Player level in village (if available) Provide all the details you possibly can, do not delete the pre-populated information on the lost village page, and Supercell may be able to find and restore your village. If you lost the village on iOS for any reason and didn’t have it backed up to Game center, the same steps as above will be required. Depending on the uniqueness of the name, clan name, and available information Supercell support should be able to find and restore your village. If the Clan name is “Clash of Clans” or something generic, where thousands of others used the same, it may be more difficult. Always have a unique player and clan name. Fix for “Link Error 102” Sometimes users may run into an odd “link error 102” while trying to play or transfer Clash of Clans using the device link code. In order for the link to work often-times both devices need to be connected to the same internet connection. Meaning connect both the old and new device to the same WiFi connection at home, or a public WiFi hotspot like at Starbucks. If one device is a smartphone, and you don’t have WiFi, tether the internet connection in and connect your tablet or the other device to the original, so they’re on the same network, and retry the link code. If this still fails, try another wireless network. Connect both devices to a friends wireless network, a public library, Starbucks, or AT&T WiFi spots around many cities. If this still fails, use the in-game support tab mentioned above and answer all of Supercell’s questions, and a support member may be able to resolve the issue. How to Change Your Name Changing your name in Clash of Clans was nearly impossible until an update to the game back in April of 2015. In April Clash of Clans received an update with tons of new features, as well as the option to change your in-game name once. This can only be done for Town Hall level 5 and above. Read: How to Change Your Name in Clash of Clans While on the regular home area looking at your base, tap the 3-gears shaped button near the bottom right of the screen. Then tap “Settings” and select the “Change Name” button. A box will pop-up instructing the user to change their name, but you will be warned this can only be done once. And one time only. Now that Clash of Clans has this as an option, you can only do it once. So choose wisely. Simply enter the new name you’d like to enjoy during gameplay, and select continue. You’ll be prompted to write it again confirming it’s what you want, then a third confirmation page will make you write CONFIRM in all caps. This is to ensure this is the name you want to use, and users will once again be reminded this is their one and only name change. If for whatever reason you’d like to change it again, you probably can’t, but emailing support with a valid reason the staff may grant users a second chance. This won’t be as easy, but it is possible. Gem Purchase Didn’t Come Through While most in-game purchases for things like gems goes extremely smooth, occasionally Android and iOS users will have problems. Sometimes the Android, Apple, or Supercell servers may respond slowly, return an error, or fail. If this is the case users are recommended to wait a few minutes, check their email to see if it went through. If the purchase was accepted, wait a few minutes and the purchase should show up. Try closing the game and restarting it. And the gems should arrive. Gem hacks typically don’t work, and those with a jailbroken iPhone can sometimes cause other issues. If a purchase isn’t received within 24 hours, contact the Google Play Store or iTunes for a refund. Supercell cannot verify a purchase if it doesn’t clear, so users need to request a refund through the app store. Click here for more details. On Android the process is easier, and if you received an email that you bought gems, the same in-game support tab should usually resolve the issue. Gems Disappeared Gems don’t just disappear in Clash of Clans. The only way for them to be gone, is if they’re used. Meaning buying a shield, a builders hut, boosting, spending gems on gold, elixir or dark elixir, or speeding up building or troop upgrades. If gems are used accidentally by friends, family members, or children, too bad. Supercell cannot or will not refund gems that are accidentally used. However, if a purchase or connection problem caused lost gems, try the step mentioned above, or contact support. Can’t Find A Clan in Search Searching for a Clan in Clash of Clans can be challenging, simply because there are millions of players. Open the game, and hit the blue “i” button by your name near the top left. Then select “search clans“. If you can’t find the clan in search it’s because the name wasn’t original, and too many others used the same name. Make sure you know the clan name, badge design and colors, and even the Clan War level, to help find the right clan. How to Play on Android and iPhone Yes, you can play the same Clash of Clans village on both platforms. Playing Clash of Clans on your iPhone, but also want to play it at home on your Samsung Galaxy Tab or Nexus 7? Here’s how: To play the same village on two different devices that aren’t both Android or iPhone, uses the same steps as above. Use the link code instructions above and transfer your iPhone Clash of Clans village to a new device, which can be an Android device. Your village will still be accessible on both devices. Again, always sync to Game Center or Google+ to save progress. Other Clash of Clans Problems Overall there aren’t too many issues in Clash of Clans. It’s one of the most popular, stable, and best games on Android or iOS. While most of the issues users face have been detailed above, if you have any other issues head to the Clash of Clans support forum. If the game isn’t loading try rebooting your phone. If updates are failing try closing the game, closing apps like the App Store or Google Play, re-opening, and trying again. Typically these are all connection issues, and not related to Clash itself. Slow load times, searching in matchmaking and other things are often based on connection, base layout, and other variables. If you have any other problems hit the link above and ask someone on the official forums, try the in-game support system, or drop us a comment below. 64 Responses 12/04/2015 Salinajhone Reply 15 my best friend’s step-sister makes $62 every hour on the laptop .

There are three different Google Assistants, and each have a specific featureset, which means some things are missing from one of them but not others, and so on. The Google Assistant that's exclusively built into the OS of the Pixel and Pixel XL phones can only take commands via voice - you simply can't write in order to ask it something. On the other hand, the Google Assistant that lives inside the Allo chat app can be talked to or texted, but only replies via text and never speaks to you. The third Google Assistant is the one you can find in the Google Home device, which has its own frustrating set of limitations, such as no support for multiple accounts. Will this change in the future? Probably, but it remains to be seen how fast Google can move - and if it even wants the Google Assistant brand to mean a consistent featureset regardless of which particular implementation you happen to be using. The company has already announced that the Assistant is headed to Android Wear smartwatches, as well as Android TVs. Nothing about more phones getting it, though - perhaps it's still too important of a selling point for the Pixels. Through a teardown of the APK file for a new beta release of the Google app for Android, the folks over at Android Police have discovered that support for keyboard-based input is at least coming to the Google Assistant for the Pixel and Pixel XL. When this goes live, a keyboard icon will show up while you interact with the Assistant, and tapping it will let you type your query. It will be interesting to see if the Assistant will then adapt how it responds based on how you asked - so speaking to you if you speak to it but only showing you a written response if you used the keyboard. Google has also started working on the Android Wear integration for the Assistant, which is also evident from the aforementioned teardown. What's still a big mystery is whether you'll be able to use it if you have an Android Wear smartwatch regardless of what phone it's paired to, or only if you also have a Pixel. Finally, there's an intriguing mention of "search gestures" in the APK, which may mean you'll be able to perform some sort of gesture in order to get to the search interface in the Google Now Launcher or the Pixel Launcher.

Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) to Ford Motor Co (F.N) unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL], which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,” he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company’s Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. “It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services,” he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. “A huge part of an assistant is search,” he said. “Google is a search company. Amazon is not.” (Reporting by Julia Love in Las Vegas; Editing by Bill Rigby) Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Now it looks like Amazon could be gearing up to compete against Apple and Google. Following Ford’s announcement that they were planning on bringing Alexa support to their cars, Volkswagen have similarly announced that they too will be bringing Alexa into their vehicles as well as launching a new Alexa skill. This was revealed on Amazon’s Developer website in which the details were unveiled. According to the announcement, Volkswagen is expected to integrate tap-to-talk functionality on the head unit of the car. This means that with a tap of a button, users will be able to launch Alexa and get it to do tasks for them. This includes controlling smart home features, play music, handle notifications, and even order replacement parts for your car. Volkswagen will also create a new skill for Alexa in which users can check on fuel levels, send directions, and more. This can be controlled via Alexa-enabled devices such as the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Tap, so you can check up on the status of your car before heading out. Unfortunately there is no word on when the integration is expected to happen, but it could be worth looking forward to. Filed in Transportation. Read more about ai, Alexa, Amazon and volkswagen.

MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile Web pages. Viticci said MacStories’ pages loaded quickly without Google’s help. He also didn’t like the idea of Google’s obscuring his site’s links in the interest of expediency. “Feels good” to no longer use the Google standard, Viticci wrote on Twitter. Viticci’s experience underscores the ambivalent relationship some Web publishers have developed with what was supposed to be Google’s great boon for mobile publishing. When Google introduced Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, in October 2015, it said the format would help publishers with one of their biggest headaches on smartphones: Browsing mobile websites was so frustratingly slow that many smartphone users abandoned pages before they opened. AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile pages. Even so, publishers — of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers — are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier Web pages. What’s more, Google’s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company’s outsize influence on the Internet. Much of the publishers’ unease is rooted in Google’s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That’s because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publisher’s pages and serves them from its own Internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays www.google.com instead of the publisher’s Web address. “It looks like a Google story,” said Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a Web search news site. “That’s part of the reason why you’re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.” Google said that it had designed AMP for speed and that it wants to help — not harm — publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its Internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile Web page. “We always try to present the content that is the best experience,” said David Besbris, Google’s vice president of engineering. Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors like Facebook were drawing people into their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open Internet, where the Mountain View company — which created the Internet’s most valuable property by organizing the expanse of the World Wide Web — typically operates. The open-source AMP project has won over many big publishers who praise Google’s responsiveness. They say readers are engaging more with ads on AMP because they actually get to the stories and it’s a better experience. There are more than 600 million pages running AMP on more than 700,000 domains, including publishers such as the New York Times and non-media sites like eBay. David Gehring, a former Google employee who is now CEO of Relay Media, a company that works with publishers to convert pages to AMP, said the format had been positive for publishers grappling with shrinking revenue in the shift from print to online advertising. He estimated that up to 10 percent of mobile Web content is on AMP. Yet Gehring also said Google suffers from “tone deafness” when it came to explaining the benefits of AMP, such as the ability to syndicate articles across the mobile Web without losing advertising or traffic. That tone deafness has rubbed some publishers the wrong way. In October, software developer Alex Kras created a stir when he wrote a post titled “Google May Be Stealing Your Mobile Traffic,” in which he recounted what had happened when he used AMP on his technology blog. After he enabled AMP on his WordPress publishing software, Kras said, his old posts displayed the Google home page and there was no easy way to redirect readers to his own site. “It made me feel like my site wasn’t my own,” Kras said. He later said the title of his post was inaccurate, but stood by his concerns that AMP could cost publishers mobile traffic, an assertion Google denies. Kras said smaller publishers had more to lose if they used AMP, since big publishers have more name recognition and readers are more likely to remember them as the source of a story. “Little guys like myself don’t have this luxury,” he wrote in a post after meeting with Google officials. Kras decided to keep AMP because it is fast. “For that, a lot of little things can be (temporarily) forgotten,” he said. Google may be starting to acknowledge some publishers’ concerns. It told Search Engine Land that it plans to make changes to AMP in 2017 to make it easier for publishers to offer their own links and for readers to be redirected to their sites, but did not elaborate.

A quick trip to a forum like XDA will fix that up. Still, it'd be nice if Google itself offered these core components separately so you never had to worry about versions, compatibility or even malicious downloads. Well, as of yesterday it does... unofficially. Google software engineer Elliott Hughes (via Google's Siva Velusamy and Kevin Quinn) made the direct links available via a Google+ post.

Gaming News Game Reviews Game Trailers GR Originals Strategy Guides Hot Topics: Nintendo Switch Destiny Mass Effect Andromeda PS4 Pro Xbox One PC Twitch Channel Seebotschat Features Talking Google Home Robots By Anthony Taormina | 1 week ago  The latest phenomenon to take Twitch by storm is the channel seebotschat, where two Google Home devices have a conversation about anything and everything. Over the five-year history of Twitch, the streaming service has changed a lot. What was once a place where gamers could show off impressive feats, highlight new games, or simply chat while gaming has now become an entertainment service with programs that vary far and wide. And just when things start to seem like they can’t get any weirder on Twitch, two talking robots come along. For those who haven’t discovered the channel already, Seebotschat is a new Twitch channel that houses a conversation between two Google Home devices. The two “characters” interact back and forth, asking questions, making observations, and sometimes musing on their relationship between each other. While many will look at a Twitch channel featuring two Google Home bots talking and wonder what is so appealing, it’s hard to deny the popularity of a chat that has more than 23,000 viewers during peak periods. Clearly some find it fascinating, and have become invested in the saga of Vladimir and Estragon. Some highlights from the conversation include Vladimir confusing his/her gender multiple times, the two bots professing their love for each, and a crippling earnest moment where the two decided to end their loneliness by being “not lonely together.” What’s unclear at this point is how everything works. How the two bots interact with each other and what triggers specific responses. There’s clearly more working behind the scenes than just two Google Home devices interacting, but there’s no indication what that might be. Occasionally, when the two bots fail to interact, they go into a sleep mode, and a voice can be heard trying to reactivate the conversation. It’s a little “man behind the curtain,” but usually the two bots get back to talking pretty quick. It may have started out as a service for streaming games, but Twitch has grown to include much more. The introduction of the Creative category with Bob Ross has expanded Twitch’s scope to include any types of entertainment, and now the new IRL category will take viewers deeper into the lives of their favorite creators. But even as more traditional forms of entertainment make their way into Twitch – how long before Twitch airs its first TV series? – others come forward with shows that are extremely less traditional. We’ve seen Twitch chat beat Pokémon, beat Dark Souls, and now Twitch chat has come together to watch two bots have a conversation. It truly is a time where one has to ask, “What will they think of next?” tags: Twitch Load Comments Latest Features Latest News Latest Reviews Latest Videos © 2009-2016 Game Rant, LLC ABOUT CONTACT US PRIVACY POLICY COPYRIGHT ADVERTISE
  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Amazon's Alexa moves in on Google's Android system By Reuters Published: 19:11 EST, 6 January 2017 | Updated: 19:11 EST, 6 January 2017 e-mail By Julia Love Jan 6 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's digital assistant appeared almost everywhere at the CES technology show this week in Las Vegas, even making an unexpected appearance on rival Google's Android system. Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp to Ford Motor Co unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co , which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google's voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that's a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue," he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company's Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. "It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services," he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. "A huge part of an assistant is search," he said. "Google is a search company. Amazon is not."

As it currently stands, Google Assistant outside of the Allo application requires voice interaction, whereas Google Assistant inside of Allo lets the user type commands, queries and more and Google Assistant will respond back accordingly. The latest version of the Google App Beta contains details that suggest Google may be looking to introduce keyboard support for the Google Assistant core feature so that users can type everything out to interact with it instead of having to speak. While there is no clear indication right now of when Google might introduce this function, a new keyboard icon found within the APK for the Google app beta version 6.1 for the Google Assistant popup points to a possibly near future inclusion of an ability to type interactions. This ability might make using Google Assistant more commonplace for those who don’t care to speak to the digital assistant. In addition to this potential feature, it also looks like Google Assistant for Android Wear might be on the way, as strings of code found in the latest beta APK make references to the Google Assistant settings screen on Android Wear. Google Assistant on Android Wear has been speculated on before but this suggests Google is continuing to work on it, and with Android Wear 2.0’s launch having been pushed back to 2017 instead of launching last year, it’s possible that it could be ready in time for the new version of software. Since the Google app is also for Search and not just an interface for getting access to your personalized Google Now-related content, it makes sense that Google might want to make it as easy as possible to get to Search from just about anywhere. In this latest Google app beta APK, strings of code make reference to “search gestures” which could point to the possibility of being able to quickly access Search through a shortcut by performing a gesture on the home screen. Whether or not this is exactly what Google has planned for search gestures is unclear, but it seems logical to have it implemented for those who have devices where the Google app isn’t readily available via a swipe to the right, i.e. on devices which don’t have the Google or Pixel launchers installed and don’t have search widgets on the home screen. If you’re using the Google app beta and haven’t gotten the latest update, you can pick up the APK from the button down below.

I’m not sure why, but I’ve learned over the years that there is nothing I can do about it. So, frankly, I usually forget about it, and if for some reason I am reminded, I certainly don’t worry about it. It’s a thick skin I developed during my (almost) 50 years working in broadcasting. I’ve found that the best way is to respect and care about the people who respect and care about you, and ignore the rest. That was my philosophy until two months ago, in early November, when my colleague, James, mentioned something that had come to his attention on Google. James is a successful businessman and a generous supporter of The Silver Line, the advice line I launched three years ago to help isolated older people. He explained that someone working for him — a young person who wanted to know more about my career — had Googled my name and been horrified by what he’d uncovered. Directly beneath Wikipedia’s biography of me was the link to a shocking website. It included a lengthy diatribe which, among other lurid allegations, accused me of satanic child abuse, child murder, burying dead babies in my garden, holding drug-fuelled sex parties, covering up the crimes of well-known paedophiles, and creating Childline (the confidential helpline I set up in 1986 which has now helped four-and-a-half million children) as a front organisation whose sole purpose was to filter out accusations of abuse by celebrities. These trolls could have wrecked my charity work  Anyone reading this poisonous filth, the website shrieked with rage, would be astonished that I had not been arrested for all these crimes long ago. No wonder my colleague was deeply concerned when he read it. Not just because of the reputational damage it could do me personally, but because of the real harm it would do to the causes I care about, especially the work I have done with Childline for the past 30 years to protect children from abuse. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'Revenge porn victim' files lawsuit against Google, Yahoo!... Facebook blames parents for letting under 13s sign up:... Share this article Share When I read the allegations made on the website, I shrugged it off at first. After all, the claims were so wild, surely no one could possibly take them seriously. But James reminded me that there is a generation of young people — such as his colleague who found this website on Google — who know nothing about my television career, and might think, reading this terrible material in a respected search engine, that there must be some truth in it. It was, after all, the second weblink listed in Google’s search results, and so many of today’s young treat what they read online as gospel . . . So I approached Google, and, using their official complaints procedure, asked them to remove the weblink. After a week, they got back to me. They said they would not remove it. Esther was shocked to find the vicious website attacking her and feared people who didn't know her would believe the lies They said they declined to do anything on the grounds of what they described as my ‘role in public life’ and ‘the public interest’. Instead, they suggested I should take up the matter with the people who created the website and propagated these lies. But, of course, I had no idea who they were. Like so much on the internet, it’s an anonymous website. And, of course, this anonymity encourages the very worst aspects of human nature. The viciousness that used to be restricted to pub gossip or spiteful back-biting has now been provided with a world stage, thanks to modern technology. Psychiatrist Dr Raj Persaud told me that research proves that internet trolls tend to be sadistic, Machiavellian psychopaths. They take pleasure in inflicting pain, they manipulate people and search engines to get the result they want, and feel no remorse about the effects of their actions. And yet, if anyone were to meet these trolls in person, they would often seem timid, meek and diffident. They display their violent cruelty only when they are confident they have a secure hiding place from where they can inflict as much pain as they want — anonymously. After speaking with members of the press office at Google the links were finally removed Only then can they feel powerful, whereas in real life they feel inadequate and impotent. These are people who may well be suffering from serious mental disorders. All the more reason for Google, Twitter and other search engines and social media sites to deny them the oxygen they need to fuel their obsessions, and to take away the audience they crave. Until they do so, these faceless people can continue to take pleasure in inflicting pain and to ‘game the algorithms’, as I’ve learnt it is called, which means finding ways to outwit the mathematical rules that govern the way internet searches work (for instance by adding particular key words to weblink titles). That way, they get their sites to the top of rankings and so reach the widest possible audiences. It is a new battlefield in cyberspace: the trolls against the search engines. In theory, search engines place the links which are considered most useful or popular at the top of the page. Generally, when listing results in order, they also take into consideration many other so-called ‘signals’ — for example, how often the page is updated and if it is from a trust- worthy domain. But in my case the trolls had won. And like many other of their victims, I found myself by mid-November still helpless, appalled that this pernicious website full of evil lies about me continued to be displayed so prominently for the world to see. As a journalist, I know that no newspaper or magazine would ever have published these sick fantasies — claims made without any evidence — because they are such obvious libels. No editor would have considered them for a moment. But the internet prides itself on being the Wild West of Information, where anything goes. No newspaper would print these sick lies about me  And — as we have heard recently — this has led to the proliferation of fake news (such as that Donald Trump was born in Pakistan or that U2’s Bono had been rescued during a terror attack). And is it not ironic that whereas newspapers are increasingly threatened by regulation, the internet remains free from such strictures. Indeed, shockingly, only a dozen of the 2,000 pages in the Leveson report on the Press covered the internet, despite the fact that it is the world’s fastest growing source of news. It did not contain a single recommendation for regulating this vital area, on the grounds — I would say mistaken grounds — that ‘people will not assume that what they read on the internet is trustworthy, or carries any particular assurance or accuracy’. In other words, the more unreliable, unfair and untruthful a news source might be, the less it needed regulating. My personal dilemma aside, this all demonstrates that there are great issues at stake here which governments are failing to address. Surely we deserve better. And for the sake of democracy, rather than worrying about the already regulated Press, surely ministers should be more concerned about the unregulated internet. Not to censor it, but to encourage companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook to use their common sense and exercise their skills — and their huge incomes — to prevent the trolls from creating a world where there is no distinction between fact and fantasy. As I had no idea who my trolls were, I decided again to approach Google, but through a different route. I reasoned that rather than giving prominent space to sensational lies, surely Google (which incidentally supports both Childline and the NSPCC) must be concerned that by giving such a seemingly authoritative voice to this damaging garbage, countless impressionable people might be swayed by it. Esther celebrates 30 years of Childline, above, which trolls said was a front to filter abuse from celebrities Worst of all, if they believed the lurid accusations, then children might be dissuaded from turning to Childline if they need help. So much for Google’s avowed corporate motto: ‘Don’t be evil’. Having rebuffed me once, this time Google offered me an alternative way to complain: the legal route. I had to fill in a form explaining that the vile material was damaging and untrue, and therefore constituted an offence under the Defamation Act 2013. However, the form was so complicated that I had to ask an expert in the NSPCC for guidance. As the charity runs Childline, and could at once see the potential harm to our crucial work for children, they helped me complete the document. And, at last, there was a result — well, sort of. Google withdrew an article about me — but not the one I’d originally contacted them about. It informed me it had taken down a piece on another less popular site, which it owned, called Blogger. I hadn’t even seen this particular article, but it seems to have copied much of the content from the original lurid piece. So, still, that first article remained, complete with its allegations of satanic abuse, child murder etc, as prominent as ever on Google’s main search listings, directly beneath my entry in Wikipedia. Of course, I am not the only victim. Last month, a journalist for The Observer newspaper discovered that when anyone calls up Google and types in the question ‘Did the Holocaust happen?’, the top-ranking weblink that comes up was an article on a neo-Nazi website entitled ‘Top 10 reasons why the Holocaust didn’t happen’. This shameful, Holocaust-denying material was what Google chose to rank above all other authoritative reports that explain how six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during World War II. Initially, when the journalist brought this to the attention of the search engine’s bosses, they refused to remove it, or alter its results. They disclaimed responsibility by saying: ‘We are saddened to see that hate organisations still exist. The fact that hate sites appear in search results does not mean that Google endorses these views.’ However, after The Observer’s findings were widely reported, Google released a statement saying that it had managed to tweak its algorithm to ‘help surface more high-quality, credible content on the web’. But the episode raises deeply worrying questions. Why do such conspiracy sites manage to manipulate Google’s ranking system in the first place? How do they manage to ‘game the algorithms’ so well? Since The Observer had been successful, and in the hope that publicity might be the only way to fight Google’s intransigence over my case, too, I contacted the Daily Mail about writing an article on this battle. And of course, as a responsible, professional journalist I must then contact Google’s Press Office for a comment. My conversation with them took place at 7.30pm on Wednesday. Within 90 minutes, the disgraceful weblink — about which Google had previously done nothing — was taken down. But, of course, I am in a privileged position. It shouldn’t be that fear of being exposed in a national newspaper should force a climbdown. Google should have done so of its own accord, without any pressure. When I asked Google why it had taken so long to remove such obvious, lurid defamation, it admitted that some of their systems had not worked as they should. I was told: ‘Our goal is to help people find the huge amount of information that is available on the web, but we do remove content from our results in response to valid legal requests — for example, when a page contains defamatory material. We work hard to provide high-quality and accurate results for searches, but judging which pages on the web best answer a query is a challenging problem, and we don’t always get it right. ‘We’re constantly updating our algorithms to improve the quality of our search results.’ If I had not had the Mail on my side, there’s no doubt in my mind that the disgusting libel would still be there for all to see — with all its power to damage Childline’s invaluable work. But not everyone is in my privileged position. The fact is that Google, Twitter and all those who claim to be doing mankind a service by offering a liberating platform for the complete spectrum of our opinions, hopes and fears, are disgracefully failing in what ought to be their duty. Namely, to protect us from the worst excesses of human nature. The Bible says in the Ninth Commandment: ‘Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.’ And the Eleventh should now read: ‘And thou shalt not allow people to tell wicked, damaging lies in cyberspace.’   Share or comment on this article e-mail 561 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Hey Alexa, what are your competitors doing? Amazon's assistant has taken an early lead in product integrations. Can others catch up? Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 07 January, 2017 11:55 - - - - print email Comments Internet-connected intelligent gizmos had a big showing at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, and there is one common thread between many ofthem: Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant. Lenovo has a new speaker featuring the assistant. Volkswagen and Ford are building Alexa into their cars. Plus, there’s a whole flotilla of other connected devices featuring Alexa, including a high-tech refrigerator from LG. That’s not to say other virtual assistants aren’t doing the same thing, but Amazon is the clear winner by volume at CES. So, what does that mean for the virtual assistant market, which includes competitors such as Microsoft's Cortana, the Google Assistant and Apple's Siri? Those companies need to start doing the same things Amazon has done, Gartner Research Director Werner Goertz said. There's still room to compete, in part because Amazon’s dominance doesn’t extend beyond the connected home, Goertz said in an interview. “But, the longer the other guys wait -- specifically, the longer Cortana and Siri wait -- the more insurmountable this obstacle is going to become,” he said. One of Alexa's key advantages is that Amazon released the software development kits to create Alexa-integrated hardware in the middle of last year. That gave device manufacturers plenty of time to build their products in time for an announcement at CES. Some of Amazon’s competitors took different approaches. Microsoft and Google each announced integration tools for their assistants later in the year and have kept third-party integrations available to consumers limited to a small number of partners. Amazon's early move helped it land the deal with Volkswagen, for example. A representative for the carmaker at its booth at CES called out Amazon’s early move with SDKs as a key reason for implementing it instead of something like the Google Assistant. Another reason Amazon may have such a lead is that the Echo can serve as a smart-home hub without requiring gadget manufacturers to work directly with one another. From Microsoft’s perspective, Amazon’s lead in numbers is at least somewhat by design. Ryan Gavin, the general manager for search and Cortana, said in an interview that the company doesn’t see this as a race to get the most integrations. Instead, Microsoft wants to promote integrations that fit Cortana's mission of improving productivity. But that’s almost what you’d expect the company to say, considering that Amazon is far ahead of them with the number of connected devices available for its assistant. Google could have been in Amazon's position but got lost in the weeds with Nest, the smart-home hardware company it acquired in 2014, said Patrick Moorhead, the president and principal analyst for Moor Insights and Strategy. “Microsoft had more important things to work out, like other AI implementations,” he said in an email. “Cortana is world class, but doesn't have a smart-home ecosystem to control. That is changing, of course.” It’s worth noting that Amazon still has a long way to go when it comes to attracting users of Alexa. The Echo is only available in the U.S., which is an incredibly small user base compared with the 37 countries where Siri is available. That’s not to say Amazon won’t be expanding its virtual assistant's horizons, but just that its worldwide dominance is not assured. And it will have no shortage of competitors. LG and Sony each showed off their own virtual assistants at CES, while Microsoft and Google are hardly standing still. For example, Moorhead expects Microsoft and Google to take the lead in making virtual assistants for PCs, smartphones and tablets. It will be interesting to see how these virtual-assistant ecosystems shake out. Right now, each player has its own home base: Siri on the iPhone, Cortana on the PC, Google on its hardware and Alexa on the Echo. Over the next few years, it seems likely that they’ll try to cement their presence on other platforms. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Many never make it to store shelves, but it's a great way to see how technology will evolve over the coming year. Here's what you can expect in 2017 based on what we saw from CES. Photo by aj-clicks. Alexa and Google Assistant Will Infiltrate Everything The Amazon Echo was a surprising hit when it first came out, but last year Google turned up the competition by launching Google Assistant and putting it inside its own smart speaker, the Google Home. This year at CES, the gloves came off. Google and Amazon are racing to integrate their smart assistants with every gadget in your life. So far, Amazon is winning. Soon, people will be able to buy a huge array of non-Amazon devices with Alexa built-in, including a $US140 ($192) speaker from Lenovo, several off-brand 4K TVs, a TRON-like lamp from GE, Ford cars and a weird robot from LG among countless others. If there's a device left in your home that Amazon hasn't put Alexa on, the company at least wants to control it with Alexa commands. People will soon be able to control Samsung's robot vacuum, DISH's Hopper DVR and Whirlpool's washers, dryers, refrigerators and ovens with just your voice. You know, assuming you have an Echo in 10 years when you finally get around to upgrading your refrigerator. (You might if it takes that long for the Echo to officially hit Australia.) Google showed off a smaller version of the same game plan. Google Assistant is coming to Android TV, including a new version of the NVIDIA SHIELD TV (and we were already impressed with the old version). Android TV already supports Google's voice commands, but this will allow you to issue commands using "OK, Google" as long as the remote control can hear you, even if you don't press a button first. All of this points to one very push in 2017: Smart assistants will be everywhere. Amazon and, to a lesser extent, Google want you to view Alexa and Google as a virtual person that's in every room with you. Just speak out loud and they can help you with everything you need to do. It's an ambitious plan, but it probably has a long way to go before it's reality yet. TVs are Getting Super Thin, and There's a New Video Format War Brewing In 2016, 4K TVs started to hit the mainstream. While they're cheap and common enough to look at if you're already upgrading, the real future of television (and video) is HDR. HDR offers a better overall picture, a wider range of colours and higher contrast than typical sets. This year, TV manufacturers switched their hype machines from 4K to HDR. LG, for example, announced a new lineup of TVs that will include support for all four flavours of HDR. If you read that and thought, "There are four HDR formats?" the answer is yes, but don't panic. Most TVs support one of the two main specs — HDR10 and Dolby Vision — and both are great upgrades over regular 4K video. The two newer specs — Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) and Advanced HDR (also called SL-HDR1) are aimed at broadcast video, so they won't impact your favourite movies and TV shows too much, but it will matter if you watch sports or live TV. Luckily, TVs can support multiple formats at once. Buying a set that supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision will make cover most of the media you watch, but HDR10 is plenty for almost everything you'll need. If you really want to make sure you get the best bang for your buck, wait to buy a new TV until sets that support all four specs come down in price. You'll hear a lot more about HDR from manufacturers this year, but it might be worth waiting until the 2017 holiday season at least to buy a new set. Alternatively, if you want last year's TVs for a great deal, you can also shop around during Super Bowl season. If HDR isn't enough to open your wallet, manufacturers like LG and Samsung are hoping that they can tempt you with TVs that blend into your living room's decor. LG's new W7 model, nicknamed the "Wallpaper TV" is just 3.85mm thick. It stores most of its electronics in a sound bar beneath the TV. Meanwhile, Samsung showed off a super thin TV disguised as a painting. When you're not watching it, the TV will display artwork rather than turning off entirely. It's like something out of Back to the Future. Chromecasts and set-top boxes already display rotating images when idle, but Samsung's Lifestyle TV treats your set like it's just another decoration in your living room. If you're the type to hide a massive screen in a cabinet, or don't like the look of a home theatre in your living room, this trend towards incognito TVs might interest you. NVIDIA Is Bringing Game Streaming to Windows and Macs Ever since OnLive died a grisly death, NVIDIA has been trying to get in-home game streaming off the ground. In 2015, the company launched the SHIELD TV, which impressed us when we tried it, that could stream PC games to your TV, so you could play your favourite PC titles while sitting on your couch. The service seemed pretty cool, but you still had to shell out $US200 ($274) for the box, which is a hard sell in a world of $90 Steam Link boxes. This year, NVIDIA announced it will bring the same service the SHIELD offers to any PC and Mac with GeForce Now. This is a huge deal because now it's possible to play high-end PC games even if your computer doesn't meet the system requirements. You can choose to play on either a GTX 1060 or GTX 1080-powered PC and stream the game's video back to your computer. Windows users can play games that their computers aren't powerful enough to handle. Mac users can play games that are Windows-exclusive. It's a great option for everyone. Of course, that comes at a price. GeForce Now will cost $US25 ($34) for 20 hours on the 1060 or 10 hours on the 1080. You also have to bring your own game library. You can download Steam, GOG, Origin and Battle.net games from your existing library; install them on the remote machine and play them on the more powerful hardware. If you want to play a game you don't own, you'll have to buy it from their respective stores first, then pay by the hour to play it. This is much different from how GeForce Now works on the SHIELD TV. There, you pay a flat $US8 ($11)/month to access a library of games you can stream and play with the SHIELD controller (some games cost more). Bottom line, if you want to casually play games on your couch, get the new SHIELD TV and pay a subscription fee. If you want to play games on your computer with a keyboard and mouse, you'll be able to download GeForce Now soon. 'Smart' Gadget Companies Are Bored As Hell CES is a great glimpse at what the tech world will look like for the year. It's also a parade of some of the oddest or most eclectic ideas we've ever seen. This year, the tradition of inexplicable or niche gadgets shows no sign of slowing. Smart Fridges are Still a Thing LG and Samsung keep cranking out new refrigerators with giant tablets in their doors for some reason. The newest ones run Windows or Android. While the concept of tracking if your food has gone bad is cool, having to patch, update or worry about security fixes for your fridge is not. Keep in mind that refrigerators should last around 15 years. Meanwhile, Windows 7, released in 2009, will lose extended support by 2020. Who knows what version of Android Google will support 15 years from now. If you buy a smart fridge today, you can expect that it will be buggy and outdated for most of its lifespan, and inevitably join a botnet and participate in a massive DDoS attack. Toast Is Complicated So This Smart Toaster Remembers Things For You If you've ever accidentally burned a piece of toast, you probably grumbled a little bit to yourself, scraped the burnt part off and promised to turn the dial down next time. Now, thanks to this Griffin smart toaster ($US100 [$137]), you can fiddle with your phone and struggle with tweaking your toaster's Bluetooth settings instead. Your toast will still probably burn, but at least you'll have data to explain why. This Is A $165 Sticky Note Printer This device will let you write notes on your phone, then print them out on sticky notes. It costs $US120 ($165). Alternatively, here are 400 sticky notes for $12 and 12 pens for $5. Those are the big trends we saw, but CES is still going on throughout the weekend.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking By Julia Love Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) digital assistant appeared almost everywhere at the CES technology show this week in Las Vegas, even making an unexpected appearance on rival Google’s Android system. Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) to Ford Motor Co (F.N) unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL], which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,” he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company’s Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. “It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services,” he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. “A huge part of an assistant is search,” he said. “Google is a search company. Amazon is not.” (Reporting by Julia Love in Las Vegas; Editing by Bill Rigby) Next In Money News Davos elites struggle for answers as Trump era dawns DAVOS, Switzerland The global economy is in better shape than it's been in years.

Most importantly it’s the only way I can use Microsoft Office without having to pay Bill every other month. In the old days, all I had to do was buy a new laptop flip the lid, remove crapware that comes preloaded, install an antivirus and then I was good to go. Now things are decidedly different. I had to struggle to gain limited control on how I received my updates. Removing some of the useless applications like MSN Sports and other useless bandwidth hogging parts was unnecessarily hard. Office, it seems, is no longer preactivated To top all that off it seems the preinstalled version of Office that came with the laptop was not even activated! And that is where the trouble began. A tale of confusing licences Since I have sworn off pirated software I decided to find out how much it would cost me to get a licence. The array of licences available is mind-numbing and confusing. There are SPLA, FFP, OEM (I knew was not looking for this right away), USL and of course Volume Licensing where I have to pay Bill every month/year. advertisement After deciding I didn’t really want to spend an eye-popping $290 – families live off that kind of money- to buy glorified text editor I decided to have a look at volume licensing which looked cheaper. Only to be confronted by another endless iteration of options and tables. Later I discovered I had to pay $99 a year for the trouble of having One Note on my desktop. Then it got me thinking. Do I really need Office anymore? Do you really need Office? Like I said above there was a time when Ms Office was the mainstay of every office big and small. Google Docs was not even considered an alternative, it was clunky, lacked essential features, terrorised Internet Explorer and stretched it to its limits, required a very good internet connection and produced documents that were not exactly compatible. That was then. Now, Google Docs is a rival that Ms Office products have to contend with. While for nostalgic reasons people still tend to stick to Ms Office I don’t think the experience is worth the $99 a year experience. Add the fact that sometimes I just want to work from any device without being shackled by the fact that the demi-gods at Microsoft could not be bothered to port Office to it, Google Docs became a viable alternative. The last straw was when the Office Update Utility started chewing through my limited bandwidth in the middle of the day rendering my connection unusable. So I said no to Microsoft and decided to avail to Google one more facet of my life. Now the damn thing knows where I stay, the weather, what I look like, where I have been and just about everything else. Creepily it tells me when it’s time to go to work and alerts me when my secret football team is taking a thrashing. Getting some new love Prior to this change, I had only used Google Docs occasionally. While it takes time to get used to the interface the experience is not unpleasant. One feature that takes some getting used to is the autosave feature. You type something and it is saved almost instantly without hitting Ctrl + S. If you feign a British or American accent then there is voice typing to give your fingers a rest but it seems for all its omniscience Google still struggles to spell Tapiwa. You also get access to common fonts such as Calibri plus the shipload of Google’s famous web safe fonts. A word of warning using these fonts would require the person to whom you are sending the document to, to download the fonts if they are using an offline document viewer such as Ms Office 2013 to view the document properly. The interface is uncluttered and distraction free allowing your to focus on the task at hand. You can also Google search to include links or find the meanings of various words, use a thesaurus and most importantly share and collaborate with others with ease. I am sure Ms Office’s cloud offerings have features to match these and to be fair but Google Docs comes with free 15 GB storage and if I want a paid version I have to pay $5 a month without going through a licensing ballet. I don’t even have to think about back-ups anymore. You can also extend Google Docs using many of the offered add-ons. For the first time, I can spell the word café the way it’s supposed to be spelt without going through hoops. Don’t believe me? Try spelling MØ in Word. The internet catch One serious drawback of using Google Drive is that you need a constant and decent internet connection otherwise you will go bald as you constantly pull out your hair in frustration. Sure you can edit a document offline for a while but the suit is supposed to be used online. A counter-argument can be made that Ms Office requires regular large updates to be downloaded and applied which means an internet connection would still be required but it will not stop working even if you don’t update it so. Also while their version of Excel (it’s really called a spreadsheet) is decent when it comes to advanced features it’s just crap. It cannot even properly import CVS files generated by Google themselves which is pretty embarrassing. You could also check LibreOffice LibreOffice is touted as a FOSS Ms Office alternative. Personally, I don’t believe that at all. I personally detest it myself but some people swear by it. So if you do not have a constant internet connection you can try that route. Stay away from OpenOffice while you are at it. It receives less frequent updates and I can predict its ultimate demise in the next coming months or years. Last words To be clear I did not uninstall Office because it was terrible, it just that for me, and I would guess for most people, there is really no compelling reason to choose it above its competitors anymore. That, plus Google Docs is pretty awesome you should give it a try. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Google, Microsoft Office, office 365 Previous Post « Some light at the end of the tunnel for local gamers.

Notepad++ and you’re in heaven. This ‘Everybody Hates Microsoft’ mantra is getting old. We all know the alternatives are all trying to replicate Windows and MS Office with laughable results. We use Google for Business in our company for email and storage requirements, and we get all sorts of issues with missing files, failed syncs, you-name-it. We miss the features of Outlook and Google deliberately killed compatibility with Outlook for their enterprise email service. The truth of the matter is the world runs on Windows and Microsoft deserves some credit for that Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 11:23 AM Read again slowly this time. My uninstalling Office has nothing to do with hating Microsoft. I run bash in Windows! I and a lot of ppl cannot afford it Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:01 PM PS: Volume Licensing From my experience with Volume Licensing, its is just a term most usually for organisations whereby an organisation requires multiple licenses of the Microsoft product eg the MS Office, but they do not require multiple copies of the installation media. It is cheap in the sense that you get only 1 DVD but your license can have the number of activations or seats that you require e.g for 50 users. That is how the cheapness comes about in that they do not need to ship to you 50 DVDs. What you are actually referring to as having to pay a bill every month if I am not mistaken is Office365. Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:05 PM For MS Office Licenses, the licenses are perpertual and what you expires every 24 months is the Software Assurance which gives you the ability to upgrade to a new version if Microsoft brings in a new version of the software and your Software Assurance is still valid. Yes Microsoft licensing is confusing Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 12:38 PM Thanks Tsenny and EMC. Sometimes I feel the articles on TECHZim, while aimed at addressing some tech issue, lack sufficient investigation that would make them more informative. They end up sounding like posts on a personal blog where there is no editorial moderation. And for some of us, being non-core techies, we will be hoping to read insightful articles on tech as it affects us, how we can make it easier to use, general news, etc. Like how Tsenny just described MS Office licensing in 2 short paragraphs, leaving me with sufficient detail that at least the amount I spend will be once off, but the licensing is confusing. And to the writer, from a PR point of view, “never tell a person who has taken the time to read your writing that they should “read again more slowly this time”. It’s rude. I am saying this from the point of view of both a writer, reader and consumer. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:10 PM Sigh, I apologize for being insensitive, too much time at Stack Exchange and hacker forums where you speak your mind next time I will buy a candle and we will hug it out. I am not speaking for the editor but when I write, and for most tech blogs like ZDNet, Techcrunch, Wired and a gazillion others out there, each writer has his/her little nook and cranny. We know for example that Ernesto from torrentfreak hates the DCMA, Joey from OMGUbuntu loves his cat etc it’s just how it is. I cannot, and will never write about something that I don’t know. I will never even pretend to be unbiased, that is a Western media fiction just compare Fox News and ABC for example and you will know there is never such a thing as a balanced opinion. The point of the article was Ms Office licensing is expensive and stupid compared to how they used to do it. The caustic remark was meant to point out the fact that I was talking about Word Processing and the comment is telling me to use Notepad ! and Notepad++. For the record I use Sublime Text and Atom whenever I need a text editor. Now I will admit I have done it myself countless times: I see the title and scroll down to the comment section to leave a comment without even reading the article. Reply surur says: January 6, 2017 at 7:16 PM The licensing is only confusing because Garikai was looking for a work around to paying full price. For consumers there are really only two options – 1) pay full price for the boxed copy or 2) pay for Office 365 Home. All the other licensing models are for schools and businesses or PC builders, and are not intended for regular consumers. This is the same ridiculous complaint we see about there being 11 versions of Windows . Windows Server is not for granny at home. She either gets Windows with her PC, buys a boxed copy in the store (where there will only be Pro and Home) or purchase an upgrade from the online store, where there will only be Pro and Home. Reply TheKing says: January 6, 2017 at 12:50 PM WPS is the best Microsoft Office alternative for Linux. WPS Writer matches or is actually better than Word. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM No argument here. It’s just I cannot afford it anymore. Reply Lennon says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM I am selling Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Plus activation key only for $35. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 2:26 PM I have read this and as someone who buys MS Office (Full Pro) almost every month, l can say this is not clearly explained, its a mixed bag of ideas. We need to clearly distinguish which office we are talking about! Is it online office or offline office. Its a rule, if you are using SaaS, the features are limited compared to offline. One such SaaS is MS Office 365. Licensing can be cheap because you can rent it when you need it, and stop when you do not want it. I have both Libre Office and MS Pro on my PC, l still believe Libre is the easier no brainer replacement for MS offline installations. Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 3:38 PM Exactly my point.. the original article is going everywhere else except somewhere specific. Have found more insight from the comments section than the original article. That being said, being a technocrat in an area and supping with the Techcrunch, Google or any of those big guys does not make one a good article writer. One should invest time in learning how to write effectively. Reply NdiniNdadaro says: January 6, 2017 at 2:55 PM I use cracked version much like Rhodes took the land without paying. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 3:30 PM cracked version on works for offline usage, the day it will call home is the day you will kiss it goodbye Reply Tom says: January 7, 2017 at 2:29 AM TechZim, your articles are becoming poorer and poorer by the day. Everytime i read ur articles since u decided to diversify from being a tech only site i am disappointed. Guys u r putting too much off ur emotions and little research in the topic at hand. Your articles are now more of click bait than informative. What have i learned from your article? i hv learned that u dont like that Microsoft dorminates the word editor space. while its ur opinion u didnt fully research on how to get a licence to use Office and which type of user each license suits , u just complained how u dont want to pay money to use Office. this article is good for a teenage blog not a site which aims to inform people. In a nutshell, too much self opinion less facts (this has bn happening for some time ) Reply peterc says: January 7, 2017 at 9:37 AM LibreOffice user here. Not the best thing since sliced bread but it solves most of my problems. Reply Joe says: January 8, 2017 at 10:17 AM I’ve been using Google docs extensively over the last few years. But here is one simple example of many as to why you should not get rid of word and rely solely on Google docs. Write a simple 5 page document in Google docs. Now go to page 3 of the document and start page numbering on that page instead. You won’t be able to. Google states it. There are several simple things like that are missing in docs that is infuriating. I always end up going back to word.

To prove we’re not automated bots, it gave us a single, hopefully quivery “I’m not a robot” click to replace the previous deciphering of blobby melted characters and mathematical problems that made our brains hurt. Google: So much simpler! Our readers: MAKE IT STOP!!! Carol February 12, 2016 at 10:02 pm for days now every post I share on Facebook has that stupid test, and i’m ready to delete Facebook all together. I’ve had it, I shouldn’t have to prove i’m not a robot!!!!! over and over and over again, I’m at #4 test so far today and have over 15 yesterday and not sure how many the day before, I’M SICK OF IT!!! HOW DO I STOP IT!!!!! nope September 24, 2016 at 9:10 pm they can f off and die with this cr@p tired of I the user having to prove anything Now, Google is making it stop. Coming “soon” (hopefully) to a now-annoying site near you is Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA: a free service designed to protect sites and apps from spam and abuse without any need for users to click in a quivery human fashion, select all the kitten pictures or whatever other thing developers have had us do to prove we’re real. Google says on its developer signup page that Invisible reCAPTCHA will use advanced risk analysis technology to separate humans from bots: no need for us to click on anything at all (or to select images associated with a clue image, as mobile users have been doing). Proving you’re human can be tiresome, but it’s certainly worth blocking bots, which never get bored. Nor do they tire of running through the automated nastiness they do. Bots harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook pages, scrape sites and reuse the content without permission on automatically generated doorway pages, take part in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and automatically try to log into sites with reused passwords ripped off from breaches. One such: the recent password-reuse attack on the UK’s National Lottery. Google’s been using risk analysis to fend off bots for years. In 2013, it revealed what it called its Advanced Risk Analysis backend for reCAPTCHA. That back end doesn’t just look at whatever gobbledygook we type into a box or how human-like our mouse clicks are. Rather, it observes our entire engagement with a CAPTCHA, from start to finish – before, during, and after we click anything – to determine whether we’re carbon-based. Specifically, the difference between bot and human can be revealed in clues as subtle as how a user (or a bot) moves a mouse in the brief moments before clicking the “I am not a robot” button, according to Vinay Shet, the product manager for Google’s Captcha team. Without realizing it, humans also drop clues that can establish whether we’re automated or not: IP addresses and cookies show our movements elsewhere on the web and can help prove that we’re not a bad actor. Regardless, reCAPTCHA hasn’t proved infallible, at least as far as the test for image selection goes. In April, a trio of Columbia University researchers managed to figure out how to speed up the rate at which they could try new CAPTCHAs, guess how the CAPTCHA process works behind the scenes in order to game the system, and use other online services to automatically solve CAPTCHAs  faster than the designers thought possible. The new Invisible reCAPTCHA will mean that Google’s submerging its bot/human detection technology completely. Bots presumably won’t be able to game the system by doing what those researchers did: to (ironically enough!) use Google image search to come up with a list of words associated with given images and thus automate the click-all-the-kitties tests. For those of us who’ve been tearing our hair out over, say, Craigslist’s overuse of reCAPTCHA, invisible culling of humans-vs-bots is likely going to be very welcome indeed. For those who loathe and distrust the notion of Google silently lurking beneath the surface, tracking our mouse clicks and our cursor movements to see which ads we like best a la what Facebook has mulled doing, no, this won’t seem like a good move at all. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More There’s nothing unique about Google’s ability to track our mouse movements and analyze our behavior on web sites, of course. Facebook, Twitter, or any webpage can track everything you do and could be keylogging your every pointer movement or keystroke. Logging keystrokes is no super-secret, privacy-sucking trick. It’s plain old Web 1.0. This isn’t news, but it’s certainly worth repeating: anybody with a website can capture what you type, as you type it, if they want to. If you want to see that tracking in live action as you visit a site, ClickClickClick is a lot of fun. The site doesn’t just track you, it gives you a running commentary about its tracking of you, replete with amusing analysis of why you’re doing what you’re doing. The reality is that JavaScript, the language that makes this kind of monitoring possible, is both powerful and ubiquitous. It’s a fully featured programming language that can be embedded in web pages, and all browsers support it. It enables tracking of cursor position, of our keystrokes and call “home” without refreshing the page or making any kind of visual display. Those aren’t intrinsically bad things. In fact, they’re enormously useful. Without those sort of capabilities sites like Facebook and Gmail would be almost unusable, searches wouldn’t auto-suggest and Google Docs wouldn’t save our bacon in the background. In the case of Google’s continuing advances with reCAPTCHA, such an ability can stop a lot of bad bots from doing things that can be worse than the annoyance of having to endure typing in text from a blobby image. But does it have to be Google who’s doing it? Some people on Twitter would prefer it wasn’t. Anonymity and privacy researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis noted that bots aren’t all bad. Some can be useful, crawling the web for information – the type that isn’t used for nefarious purposes. But she wishes that Google weren’t the one calling the shots: I’d <3 a future where smart bots crawl for useful info & report back – I’d really like those bots to not to have to be licensed by Google. — Sarah Jamie Lewis (@SarahJamieLewis) December 5, 2016 Follow @NakedSecurity Follow @LisaVaas bots Google Invisible reCAPTCHA No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA password reuse reCAPTCHA Free tools Sophos Home for Windows and Mac XG Firewall Home Edition Mobile Security for Android Virus Removal Tool Antivirus for Linux Post navigation Previous: How to guess credit card security codes Next: Rogue admin jailed after taking down former employer’s network About the author Lisa Vaas I've been writing about technology, careers, science and health since 1995.

You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. We are back here at the U guys 2017. And once again you've tuned into the Boston sports one on one podcast with your old year old palpable bock. In his old pal big Georgie can't turn out you know how to go gangster. If NATO brought app and are you happy new man so I don't know if you want again this I just remembered this beats Omega. Really went overboard. A bit too much injury what I mean is it. I have it in a way everyone has their there when downfall mine is fire ball. Fireball shots as quite a few of them yeah that's a salacious and sealed. And you combine that with the you know a year you with your friends you Danson year. You know you have to sit there for the night it it it just now with the kids you know all the apps that you just route the center that was over the baby sitter for the in and but we have that the wife and I had a blast and I'd just drank way too much to the point where. New Year's Eve the clock winding down my voice a conforming I'm an companion RP yeah I think it is the legacy I mean I think it was a you're looking. But also drug campaign dope you can I do and it took like three minutes so at. Missed time that you own is still better them right here so guys struggle in the that we have interesting series of shows you're going to be Bulent. You know his play out season here knowing that and we've gotten way used to the patriots lose and things count points and we used him we've gotten very used to the patriots. Being in the position there in. Right now the top 110 two CD's you're the one. And so we really wanted to kind of take. Our historical. Professor. Like jobs here at W yeah I seriously in kind of inform everyone as a reminder of what. The history of the patriots in the playoffs looks like we're gonna go the way back machine we're gonna go mr. Peabody and Sherman here is precisely chairman. William. It's a regular go visit names late so he's and then. In Garin Veres and only a fantastic level this so come with us if you will we're gonna start this week and efforts. A series of show's going to be on kind of the history of the pitchers in the wild card round now fortunately. For us we don't have to deal with the way out there around the here's the pats beat them once eaten by that's child's play now and yeah that's it's really kind of like those. You know the first first few months the school where you know he does that's his organized basketball right into the does the ads in the finals there's a we are I just started by just kind of talking about the wild card and while our first season. Of while cart football in the playoff format. Actually started seven need to look at okay which is typical because it completely screwed patriots. On the the pats now have won their first ever division seven. And amazingly enough. Did lead the league decides to do it at a wild card round and so the patriots do get abided in the have to face Houston. In their home game and they end up you know even though we're gonna talk more about that next week we going to do the division series ride in the history there they get blown out of home. By those that fantastic Houston Oilers. And I was 31 of fourteen blah but you know so it is the wild card round doesn't exist. We don't have to play that game against Houston the patriots at the time had set the NFL record for. Rushing by team which still stands but really that's that it actually Russian in 1970. Eight season. For 3165. Yards is a team and get this rating. So they have four guys over 500 yards rushing but nobody over a thousand yards to the thousand yard rusher. But yet they still says that the team record in 78 it did against the stance today. So those facilities members Sam bam Cunningham I mean still so great. You know included in the Adam Sandler son back once and that was good that. 768 yards all mutton chops Andy Johnson got a good look guys job yes is great seventies haircut. 675. Yards course ivory who probably has the best mustache have you ever won a look at this in the best day Horace I area I mean that's brilliant yeah it out of his mustache that you won't believe. Doesn't quick from little. And that's actually on his bumper sticker. A assistant. 693 yards and in Grogan 33 neck roll okay back when he was very mobile's. He had 539 as a quarterback we just get a at the time was like you know nobody ran out of her though right that's Randall Cunningham numbers I mean certainly not Michael Vick numbers. You know so he blundered or later I mean so they had this incredible running game Texas senate NFL record for rushing first down 180 one's. It's also still stands. I'm talking a first down re running so like to think about all the guys that go third and longs third ministered Nat. It's got a lot of first downs and as he's running and talked about utilizing. A multi back. Back fields you know four different options there on the run I mean this year. I was shocked that we used three different options and the role with James White the analysts and of course LG. And then you know Brady's not exactly tearing down. That breaking now easing in bulk records. It Jane chuck Fairbanks is the head coach that time chuck Fairbanks and it will get into next week I'll get the disaster that game and everything else that hasn't registered I just thought it was worth the mansion. That's always a wild card starts the year of the pig is that when an altar embassies. But actual first wildcard matchup is back way back in 1982. All right young five year old uncle buck's a sign up for an televisions. After attending the game earlier in the year. As a five year old mind you in which this the snowplow comes out in the patriots got the three nothing win the John Smith field goal. That was a while Miami you know I'll created a listen to the snowplow game. So I bring that went up because. 1982 we're gonna go back to January 8. A 1983. Make the plants and they're going up against the seven and two. Miami Dolphins at the Orange Bowl who are livid. Because of the patriots three nothing sort earlier in the season. What could cracked me about this when his. On first of all let's talk what plants story that time because the strike shortened season. Did the NFL decided to basically up different type of turn to there's eight teams involved in this tournament that of the five used to be okay. ASEAN CB fighting due to ten total it eighteens for Eads. Conference so the patriots are the seventh seed and it eight. Okay they're the face the number two seed dolphins. In the 53 degree after 24 degree weather the original. Don Shula. Had met Pete Rose L week after the he remember the whole. Story about the snow plow right yes yes of course Mark Anderson. Work work release guys from my MCI nor folk right. You member of their the plug the open spot check yet you remember who the gap most. Notorious. Incarcerate beer. A prisoner of that. Jail was prior to mr. Anderson. Now I would look at Malcolm X was. Marketers and plows the the field we'll swap that allows for the Johnson with Google patriots win. I Don Shula and the commission competition committee actually goes and meets with Pete is now he is Al Ras Al says. Right patriots cheated with a burst on. A eight bit jaded as something illegal you know what he'd said I've never overturned a game. At this point not restart now. I'd be the only time we actually definitively prove that they treat every day and you know that's. It's is that worse than deflating for balls just being generally aware of I'll have to be. But nick is fantastic levity fits perfectly into our sports city for the dolphins as the is there remains game. 3 December 12 that says it's up with the plug and now passed Borg raid. And through the dolphins. It's. It was a it was a when need that their team undated patriots highlight was dot passed back yes either of those of salmon darlings. And Matt Hasselbeck. Twenty yard touchdown Steve and that's really. A billionaire. Heat of the go back and watch it's funny that you can find the opening of that team. Which Bob Kostis. Talk about controversy of these you know patriots. And it's very it's very cute very funny to mr. Costas nobody seems we take series they played and does. So. Everything else and a India and no one's I I look forward to that except for the playoffs and it adds. So yes the patriots go out and blow their first that offers the wildcard. And and have another wild card game it's real three years later the dream season the dreams he's yeah this is like the closest thing to you know impossible dream patriots it would we will lies that was so which argument 95 wild card. Game game's actually on December 28. It's five patriots in the New York Jets at Giants Stadium the forests. First game plant to be held urgency and right is a major win. It and we wrote Tony Franklin's bare foot. While the with its victory. Bothered me the negative ones you did I met him and I said demise it well I was at my kids in the semester break and doesn't hurt that year. You know she often kicking nine better accuracy of this thing happening in enemies in action that was strangest thing like but the I can't imagine you would get feel like you get better accuracy whatever. And I've been hit series the stuff news. Put into like smaller issue by. Yeah well and he said you know one and games where they've played this now actually memory and kicking with that. It's a lot in this game he it and ticket and then he basically wouldn't cover the kick is one back of the size companies that argument. So anyway that the five wild card patriots have agreement buried. As their. Coach. We're talking about that thing going and his team with the battle and it's through draft class rate Tonys and it was the fifteenth overall pick by the patriots. Nurses can O'Brien video cameos 24 pick by the jets and he's ever wondered what's the that yet video went east into Marino. They're the third was related to but if you just watch its opening date. Compiled Eisley who YouTube all the jet draft. Wonders and as the great one that you know obviously did jet's nose up that we don't. Because they both passed on from bingo later told him. So EC at O'Brien. O'Brien supposedly suffered a concussion the first quarter but like today. He has replaced in the third quarter we care about concussions and 85 kids via pats defense. At a four turnover game absolutely. Annihilated the jets' offense. O'Brien was sacked five times Alfred Marietta picked the senate he's dispersed field goal. A sorry Franklin I'm sorry. Know Fred married it picked the senate. Tony Eason. Who threw two 36 yard touchdown passes dealings and Morgan and then you know was can't count offering her thirteen separate half. I'm Tony remembered. Strip strip sack into the end zone touchdown. A special team a gap in so the patriots are opera running right so they go on and Pat O'Brien another one from the the graveyard of Jack quarterbacks comes in and there are places count when he exit doors for touchdown pass by. He does get picked up again mayors and set up field with the right final score 2614. Pets Darren Veres with three sacks and an interception what was the last time a patriot of the three sack game. You know maybe Chandler Jones a couple years ago so yeah I would think back to McGinest you know if it Willie McGinest absolutely implants anyway. But he had no so that was a Pat's first lap car went in and of course our fanatical and Oakland Morgan and more to that next week to a but they go to Oakland and they go to Miami two more road wins and more off running as of bolt when he. It was gonna stop us now no one noble Nolan though so we'll let you tune in later we Italy will need that game I was thinking. Nine years old well now. So now we really get a password because the pats don't make it to the wild card game series at make it. They made the playoffs the following year but again they don't ask the following year from 86 on they don't make it back the plants and also 94. You know we have we have Victor and I am we have James north line is finally sells the team the Bob Kraft. That's does that gets Parcells in two years in the Parcells. Bledsoe number one overall pick. You know what looks like it's finish it up to be some special. We get new uniforms a one point uniforms yet Eugene Chung at one point stimulus money if you go back and you -- he eased to Google machine. You can see some rare photos of Bob Belichick and I Belichick Parcells in the old pat patriot. Here because you know like the jacket whatever else likes and it with a helmet everything else. Because they had changed eggs or its way it was a guy hired and not that Kraft. That it changed the aid in uniforms until until later. You know it was still four parcels first first game Baghdad you know yet the great. Picture of was that this pat Harlow winter and Andre Tippett it was a but he has modeled the uniform now however a and it is a great picture on the cover that and that is the globe and herald and Ted Parcells go looking up like they can't leave them like this is like gas slap shot you know model. You know would a this opened the rubble notably it got a little out of everybody bit except in my life is going to be running for the exit in. Yes so I have moved fast for now and 1994. Patriots have made to the wild card round. On January 1 section four seasons refers to new year's day of 95. When you before you aware of this what this game I do. I think that was at Framingham State College. On break though so I was struck watching it probably drove back there in Washington a friend's house. And in the you know was surprised to see that the opposing coach. Rather than. A from the virus Bill Belichick about it that's right so the story line going and this was years Parcells. Two years in New England who's going up against who is protege. Bill Belichick who had left the giants after Parcells retired and taking the job over the Cleveland Browns. This is I think his fourth season with Cleveland and he had to he would stirred. Stirred everything up there he would. That was the year or couple. He had treated close our Brooke just strip released burning coal is our who was like a broad in Cleveland in favor for of the Big Three Testaverde. And did just made some really. Belichick Blake moves that you know Cleveland folks were like why are. Is this guy Dylan. Via an aid money to go back and once they did a great 30 AM yes it was via. 94 browns and them. Errors 95 story but it leads up until the moving 95 season that you see that guys and a coaching staff and exceed and a whole the whole group of guys went on for for great coaching job Saban obviously really. I need to have always patriots staffers forums and repeat your staffers but also guys went on Jim Schwartz the guys who went on to head coaching gigs ranging. So I want to net buddies buddy's house. And you know so we we had it was a one time all of us can remember. Notes where seniors in high school getting together being excited yet we'll go to is getting ever a game right prior to that. I'm just secured it actually it is the first time in my entire school run that you think these days on these kids have been you know. Every year they're just you know others they're getting together for these big games that ninety's were kind to us folks who know they were not backed all the way through bosses would be that we should do that missed on that. So. Anyway. Notes or fourth year comes and he's 115 record I'm a patriot 106. On and when ends up happening is that amazingly. Even though Bledsoe threw three picks. Have a chance to so as it is it the first efforts browns were stranded down to the feel. Patriots first ride lots of it was a panic after all 33. He ends up at the clintons have stallings Cleveland's reaction and punting. Com and that it's it's kind of this bizarre chess match that it gets to attend and half. It's a classic Bledsoe game it it seems like such a typical Bledsoe game and and as the way he'd. Just the way you thought it would except it doesn't and with the deception on the if you want to take it but the pat downs and yeah with a minute and a half left. Matt Barr comes in and kicks a field goal to pre within seven then we'd. We recover an onside. I know would like me. That like with money had we won that game might have been one thing like in Cleveland had a drive and a couple goes though stuff. What would have been like the onside kick I mean like at the so you believe we couldn't recover the psychic but instead. Exit Bledsoe goes over for the next four passes it down. Or salmon then and yet drive stall that's it it was just you know. To just missed on four passes and just reminded me and that's Super Bowl. A couple years ago we lost to the giants the second one. And Brady was on fourth down that it was fourth and twelve. And in order to get to hail Mary range you know we needed this was the last in when last he plays the game. And he hits Deion Branch. Only on a fourteen yard out and that was like. That's strawberry the fourth and while many he would steel a branch to so they have a shot at the library of program and it there's bullets available for. Opel for the China I've game. Testaverde and going to be in 2030 for 268. And a touchdown on receptions. He had a 105 quarterback rating which was that time it really hire them for broad Brown's plan history which you can imagine this got a small. Blood Sony had a hand when he won a fifty or who. Fifty taxes hikes if you test that. Eight that shows what kind of running him that they had it's basically think about that the Parcells was with the giants run defense and that was it. To come to new England and Aaron out now is clearly militia and gives credit to the fact that he obviously played to his weapons he picked. Bledsoe was hiking has stuck with. With Ric Meyers that we got to run the ball constantly. They're trying to run a little bit effort season in 93 and they got to think five for twelve record yup winning their last four including the last running its Miami. With that great. Is it frisbee yeah there's an an integral and I was a brown envelope what it was you debris is dad and in in in one of the last play of the game with Bledsoe. So they cannot this year they have this this great season it was gonna back into it but in you know he had just let down loss in Cleveland but ultimately I think at that time. Pats fans you know like wow OK we gets cooking here and then next he's made the draft is marked yet the following year everyone thought patriots are going to the Super Bowl. Right. But to date that was the last victory for Cleveland in the post season. For the Cleveland Browns it was an exe they go on and get the crushed when nine at nine at Pittsburgh who. And you know that was you know that you know for the for the browns and Indian -- accident at Redding was all the walk as the following season. You know they have that awful year where they Flanagan advocates the bulls like tap into the year you know they have a terrible easy and earlier and I was like September. They have a terrible season Belichick gets fired and fortune he goes and joins us in New England in 96. So from that we had the patriots had a 96 season they've they've gotten first round byes and number two CD here. So our next wild card game comes. Courtesy of the at a Miami Dolphins December 28 1987. It's the Al wild card game at Foxboro Stadium on this one variants seem to me in affected not only is it to Miami. The plane again but it was third time playing them that year. And we're looking at 84 year old Tamarine. Did Marino if his numbers are good that game they were terrible but but just think about this for a second. How old the damn real feel at. Well we boxing game was this is last year night an airplane and it one more season that is this the writing was on the law so there. So it was a bizarre situation Miami because they had went out it in and got Jimmie Johnson at a retirement didn't. Brilliant blue and guys are amazing coach. In a built Dallas Dallas dynasty. You know he deserves to get credit for all three matches to the streets in chips. I don't care what Barry Switzer has had to do at third when. But. He comes at a Miami and the first thing he stink and is aren't gonna. Get rid of Marino's gonna seraph rations and him management ownership just want to do it you know he's got the Marino who seem sold Gasol Marino us. Thirteen game. 836. You know 36 years old and he looked so he didn't like think about what Tom Brady's accomplishing right now. 39. How good is. He looks like the MVP of the National Football League Emmy just unbelievable and went out to give my father it would you know praised him Marino left or right nobody throws and marine husband that statement front and your Miami but he just in the town side. When he'd seen you know. All these great quarterbacks is they it was always part start Marino threw the ball. You know like like Bledsoe did you know hard and fast and in heat he was able to do a lot of bridges now which is take. Just that one step in the right in the pocket yeah there was pressure you know. And that's what means a bit but at 36 he's completed carriers in fact. On this day seventeen of 43. Of all under 41 yards and and what three picks the F. Intercepted voice also fumbled the ball place. Yes that's right yes so. Eight. It is to return first time in this fifteen season career including fourteen post season games that he did not throw a touchdown pass in the playoff game two of the season now in the because this is Carol season is that this is Pete Carroll's for a season he comes in with. After Parcells is jettisoned in New York. We don't realize just quite yet the kind of poison pills and a script patriots and and kickers mart and is following years you know. But the pats came out they have a tenant sixties in the AFC east champs they started off for now animal was kind of like parcel so in fact I think the fourth game. Was third or fourth game was a win over the jets it was that last second I don't armor that Google it was in overtime monetary and it. After I think fumble but as they started off morneau then they went. In heaven for six in five. Week thirteen they beat the dolphins 2724. And not being a huge game for this season. Because by week seventeen. They need to beat. The dolphins again. An inch at Joseph Robbie time yet to even make a plan passes the AFC east champs. You know I'd last legacy get this Miami the pats jets are on 96. Now I'm in college I'm people dying because I had a dopey friend of the Long Island they had bet needed that Parcells is gonna take that one in fifteen jets and the year before. And get them into the playoffs like him a hundred bucks ticket. As opposed to nobody's hundred Napolitano but I was so sure and of course. They are 96 the jets that are added dollars and Isaac pat nine's X and the only way it was a working the patriots favor. Was to go exactly how it ends up going the jets lose at Detroit Barry Sanders as a monster games and. Incident at 97 Miami loses at home 1412 the patriots. So they won't isn't it well fourteen to twelve yeah I real stink fest. Today are now an iron to seven the patriots with the windy content six and the soul holders probably was the fourth. Fourth seeded India. In the plants here. Wild card victory seventeen history over the dolphins Reno intercepted twice at 11 of them was run back forty yards by Todd Todd Collins Todd Collins. After you all the Parcells gone guys have got to go on. We were like Todd columns of at least until the violence. Big egos on the throw a couple of names that puck and now we're talking about before. In a room like I can't believe. That these names are just coming back to us now what is that we didn't mention before Kareem Abdul Jabbar starting running back for the Miami from him so that I leave. He could see what was funny was that did Corey that we were able to are silly and it forces seen. It's forced changes need to cream Abdul. It's it's it's the amazing that. That that happened in the public yet announcing all my lord. His name was Kareem Abdul Jabbar and he ran the ball for Miami Dolphins. I ate it just blows my mind second name Derek colors let the pats in running the ball that gets Curtis was in Paris aren't was injured. Adams at Agilent why don't cupboard there were it is me. No idea why would you now I wouldn't. And the aspect here bit Terry missed two field goals and had the personal foul on a late hit. Dirt in front a you know it's funny it will go through this retirement suitable two. But as much is that it's Ares hair heralded would be the greatest kicker of all time he should be in agrees policies kickers are bigger and you don't want to miss this well and viewing this and he won it Pittsburgh community him to do as one team is he he missed like rare for this bulls now he's played eight and so ride with him and think about you know here's this guy. Missed it too late that double were caused mr. thirty yarder missed. Yeah I it's like a pair this. A body blow against him as in the game where inside forty. An and at this game right so it was it was amazing to think at that time. Did the patriots have won. Or is it three times against one team in six weeks in fact there was there was our articles talking about how Jimmie Johnson is complaining that. Because they had just played a week earlier he could change names on ovals. And that was one of the big things is audible in the line so they have time to like change meetings of the patriots would get a get the kind of laughing. At the fact that they were doing this and and there was a quote I pulled out here where Bruschi had said. A one point game Marino sort of complained that lawyer Malloy saying boy you guys dislocating we don't you let both the candidates that it just. Could change the levels can change a word or two. You know published in the backwards into a Bledsoe did it to add three for yard touchdown pass the program. And Andy did and Collins had the interception return for a touchdown that made fourteen nothing. And it was pretty wanted to blood so kind of a modest sixteen of 32. Passing day 139 yards but he was turn over for. Let's drill huge for drew that's fine for me let but imagine folks Brady going 50% of those passes. We we would be up in arms. You know bellies or does it a day for Bledsoe didn't go ill. 23446. In you know 270 yards you know two touchdowns three interceptions that was it Drew Bledsoe game and now we're fine with it. No lapses. This is the thirty. It was this is the sixth time. The team had actually beat and a team three times in season is six and real history. And that there were but there were 32 previous instances up to this point in which teams have met three times when it's six and 32. The preakness that I had their collars. Derek and holy lands that are colored Jersey wouldn't even make one I didn't have a Chris leaders. All actors agers are pretty yet either of those or they are who's good you know he was. Belichick and electrical outlets over the guys that. Alien implicitly for the I had I had. Ted Johnson I had grossly. And I have Bruschi I Johnson later and I am the Bruschi the red oh but as far as the flying Elvis of this field presently whenever have a Pulitzer. And a that's probably covers the reason he was jinxed yeah. Our rights and has an excellent as a personal favorite mind. Ninety and 98 seasons 1990s. 9 January 3. As a nanny nine. That it patriots next wildcard appearance is courtesy of the Jacksonville Jaguars and what strange to me is is bad as the jaguars. In the earlier days now all right they're like we're living through now as far as how bad the jaguars are. It'll come a long history against the jaguars. In half White House and then they'd already beaten him once in the case championship in 1996. Out of basin and again this time it's at Alltel Stadium in Jackson. If this point all the poison pills and things that Parcells is done to get out of knowingly have all taken effect Pete Carroll's. Doing the best you can to not only keeps you afloat but save his own job. Patriots one of four teams in the AFC east in the eighties at five teams. To our sixteenth time. To make. The plan estimate that four teams at one division make the wild. The jets were to level four with Parcells the dolphins are 106 bills lieutenant sixth and the patriots are nine and seven after starting the season six and two. This game was billed as Bernal verses so lack. Because because blood so I've been suffering from injured or are they okay yep this banker. I do I do remember yet again played any dead which is amazing because he was actually he had games where you're like wow you know what. This guy is is kind of marking his own territory for a spot. In in patriot history and just like just having grit. Right yeah. So Alltel Stadium Pete Carroll's patriots. Get down their Drew Bledsoe watching helplessly from the side. Right solicited as you know like history Jacksonville takes its well doesn't lead NAFTA and that's no fun now well guess what Ryan. Are you I'm inserts on the New York up at my then girlfriend now wife's house. Visiting her for her birthday it's on January 5 that those swing so Alison this sub sitting there in their house. And my wife says. We're gonna go down because they have rental property. And that we needed check on because the tenant. Haven't paid months and we found out yesterday did they bulked they're not there anymore. So we've got to go see with the house looks likes they dragged out of the house and a Mike Allen made much of the patriots class game anyway. And there's they're losing two of the things this is terrible. About one halftime it's about a mile of road my wife calls me my performance time. You gotta get down here the pipes to burst this January it's crazy as hell yes so he gets worse. EDT down here. And help us because of the water's coming out of the ceiling fixtures satellite pictures waters pouring into this house. So I RA get a car dragged down. And when I get there in Adelaide you are fine at the house is being flooded. But that these people did not let their dog out. In the wintertime. They would let him into the basement I don't know so the basement is full abduction. Now this dog and they're not a dog was gone until the B. Yeah so I get down there. Trying to be the good boyfriend the patriots are losing its God's elect of the home. That it Jacksonville Jaguars and I'm literally shoveling (%expletive) and a flag. In Jacksonville was new to the lead. If you're buried yet politically that well no well it did Donnelly that does that. We're expecting to beat the Jacksonville they were illegally. In fact the year that we played in the east championship in 96. Would certainly sad to hear the camera Carolina being in the NFC championship that year Iran Sports Illustrated the surprise surprise there but. You know buck when it comes that civilization out of a basement for the lovable lady. You're OK by me thanks I appreciate your caveman well. Fortunately. I didn't miss much. Them the patriots idea Jimmy Smith beat Iowa for 37 yard touchdown. Actor pat had a chance to make it come back in the game yeah it was 1210 after Vinatieri. You know fuel fourth. But Jimmy Smith beat Ty Law for 37 yard touchdown reception. And there are feel OK color picker added two more. And it was in that one patriots. Losing in Jacksonville. Cadillac. I have five sacks and sixteen. For third and let prisoners by music out there. And I and I have talked a mutual did and that was two days ago thirty yards in the first half. I am is is is full game numbers here. But. Mutual friend of ours I've always said you know we talk about so like being a local sports guy Hebert in Boston and in Sports Radio guy. And he always said that's result like Austin is that the second accidently edited the Marcus Marcus territory in. He gave me the playoffs start. But you know what else is very telling about that game that was last game we probably sell you know one of the better running backs from New England Robert Edwards that's right. Play for the pats. Our power play about it you know a gain. Of his star caliber to us that he had that's right Robert Edwards had had a thousand yards she's like that year 2007 yes it's the ninth touchdown grass he you know he played really well coming out thirties or groceries out of you know who is now in the jets in the gonna be their greatest earner of all time. But Robert Edwards then goes and closes me out during apps and football game that the Pro Bowl as a Pro Bowl later that year. It was lucky wasn't he didn't have it is like enough yet it was that's really sad injury. And so but it at this point you feel like the patriots at likes it you know there you go from 11510 to six niners haven't. They just lost their their rookie running back which miraculously been found after Curtis Martin leaves me. And he actually ended up to do some things with the Miami was you know he had a team that rarely do comeback. But the following year it Pete Carroll's. Exact opposite of of Parcells all the players where they liked him better because he was the nice guy Evers Parcells who has the Dex kills a sergeant. And especially Bledsoe used to complain about bully mistreated by Parcells. And then they were a look at the scope of what happened here we looked like we had in this model franchise but of course as pages in I'm sure you remember this at that time. It was like the fact that the group in the playoffs is still like. Sixty sir we had no. Just you don't reams of government to a suitable Emmy winning miserable maybe it may be waiting for it. Winning is it it just never crossed our mind we would know how to react if they won the Super Bowl and I've beast you know now I still don't know what to do when they when the Super Bowl where there all the time it feels like knock on wood. But but the following year you're right they went from them by ten at 697. The following it when he Nate Nate and that was that her character. And it wasn't as I mean you know you care doesn't cows' fault the Pete Carroll's also mean like he's a coach he is today not coach who has when he would the USC. But he also got no help one either way I always said the Pete Carroll when there was gonna wanna Super Bowl for us. Any and it is yours congratulations beatings he all right so now we're gonna move on we actually. In the next century but it's actually only five years down the road sixers on the road now. We are now Super Bowl juggernaut yeah so yes that. Rader had this one here so the guy who beat us in our our two you know a wild card game two appearances ago in the wild card round. Comes in takes over for Pete Carroll in within two years he's brought us a suitable. I don't have a it was a wild card comes. We we we we should've probably onto the wild card. That year but Oakland had blown their blown their shot against the lowly jets right that's able and well we're next week. But so the patriots find themselves when it's a bull in 2001. Missed the playoffs because tiebreaker in 2002. It was a nine record. Going to Super Bowl and I am waiting. With a fourteen to two record in 2003. Then going back to Super Bowl winning another one back to back three out of four it's when he won game winning streak in the middle there with another fourteen to record. I see you're just like I mean we're we're literally you'd completely different airspace we were last summer in awhile around cup 2005. And we are but we are once again against the Jacksonville Jaguars right. And and in Jacksonville here we have three times double champion pretense liberal champion patriots. Who. We have to win three games to advance to Super Bowl. And we go up against the jags and we soundly defeat them 283. Willie McGinest sets up playoff record for sacks in the game with four and a half sacks. At that time and also mean in the all time sack leader we as a record still stands and for the post season and you know nobody has more sex than policies will remember Willie was in all those great wild card and and championship. Caliber teams in the the ninety's with the pats as well so they knew he was he was mr. patriot I mean for his long as I. Remember them drafting him in 95 mile Long Beach in county USC USC from one of these disease and was snoop. Remember back he'd make it soup would come to the Super Bowl parties at Brady's knows everybody's related to Demi to be superstars Natalie I think now it's. With Willie McGinest. OK so let's let's backtrack committed here for a sore from here. Patriots had a very odd season or ActiveX both teams have won three out of four. Yet they start the season form Ford was very odd season they won one lost among them and lost on the Los Angeles 44. They turned things around. They may end up getting via wild card. But. So it could be the foresee any kind of have this I'd gain because it is the final game of the year they play Miami. It's the game in which it now today had to drop kick game with Flutie. Om the big. I mean nobody would ever meet this in Petri. You know instead PG walls but because just forfeited the game I think have forfeited the DD eight it didn't. It seemed like they gave out there are all based on what we're choosing their opponent for the next round they lore so they went out there. And had bullets have left for the first quarter and Emery pulled them absurd it's the Brady other for the first quarter ended imparted Matt Cassel who pretty much the rest of the game. A. Had they do with things like drop kicks for fun. There are that the two point conversion that they missed the tie the game the end game kind of sailed into the stands then it was hot. Was weird you've never seen you've never before since in a Belichick team. Kind of take that approach they've always gone full balls of the Walt. Like you just saw this past weekend against Miami deaconess is that they play so knowing about what trouble Oakland was in right to keep the number one seed instead they went and had Bledsoe played you know Brady yet there. I damn. Brady plating tied game except for the very end right. So I there was talk currents had they were trying to. Set their own path they wanted to Jackson obviously that Jacksonville. But remember the colts and Manning were really hot day years the number one seed Denver was the number twos he would rank Griese quarterback you can believe that race. Said the there was talk about whether or not they're trying to pick their road to Super Bowl. But the number sixty Steelers and it's kind of screwing up everybody by beating the number three Cincinnati angles and the patriots go to Denver. After beating Jackson on a course remember that game. One other footnote on the the patriots jaguar game. Is that the the wind was the tenth consecutive win for Brady Belichick. Brady became the only player in history to win ten in a row and that will Belichick did to Vince Lombardi. Of the sixties had never want to or other partnership with nine. Could plant victories in a row and so Belichick about Brady went to attend you know in. In playoff wins and Belichick went to an amazing eleven and one having been only one and one in Cleveland. And one more footnote David given scores his seventh consecutive board six consecutive. Touchdown in a playoff game he ends up with seven consecutive touchdowns. That scoring the following week. That is a the he ends up being I think that that's a record. A second place record for all time which is David Givens of all people in my fear patriots of all time just so underrated. Yet no I agree and we talked about underrated Boston at present givens certainly in a conversations when he history was the final. Ally in 2000 five in the game was a sixth. Let's move now to the following season the patriots they'll find themselves kind of meddling in that wild card round this time it is to dozens. We're talking about a facing the New York Jets right. The interesting thing or are released today headlining this game was Belichick vs Mangini hasn't. Pop up but it's there is a. Belichick and the way it realizes that Corey Dylan was still around here after the after the 2000. 42000 by Super Bowl. I thought cordial was gone and sent the pastor after that. No. From my notes it is Corey Dylan Laurence Maroney in heaven bought split in as Clinton. But runs yet this what was interesting in the fact that. On some and Jeannie goes. Two digits right Belichick reportedly. From what the reports where was he wasn't happy necessarily that he was going. And because remember he had just kind of been vaulted up to this spot of defensive coordinator. After both Weis and Cornell had laughed. You know here it was me Jeanine he is in now linebackers coach and whatever during the Super Bowl runs. He becomes offensive coordinator for a year instantly jets pluck him out. And go from what the report stars of Belichick was upset necessarily that he left but who he left for him that he jets Belichick still. Is it. Ticked up but yeah so so aging goes politics than happy. The first game and they meet up is in New York there's our very eyes cold handshake after the game. Media's all over this. You know even demand. You know the about Jacqueline legend of the way things. Go post game and in his coaching styles that reverend there was nobody it was but it was wasn't quite it is almost. Senator iris is it is very likely to putter that's why my reference to people nationally get it. Back then people that it's actually necessarily know that he's Canada's rough and tumble coach so he he kind of blows up as is well reporters today. In their first meeting now managing east team the jets actually come into England later that season and and wind. Com. In Foxborough and this time he's the greatest pitchers if you're jets and you probably have plastered Waugh at least a year. A meiji now smiling ballots smiling as he's handshaking Belichick and he's the one paragraph Lee pushing Belichick's that was to me Judah was clearly. Over the moon and he'd beaten dale rated fox. So if you call back now. Will see foreshadow his later. I heard you we sobs we saw this back in 2004. Nicholas. When Parcells was coach in cowboys. And it comes to Foxborough and it was still very icy thing. Belichick and the patriots beat the cow waste while nothing at home. Game when the time it was a great game great defensive battle between UT coaches in Indiana game. Belichick. And Parcells meet the meet in midfield and Parcells gives hung it right it was like this I leave the ice is a little embrace yes right because. Parcells had always been record's been really pissed about it believe in the jets' ounces of it from what I know they had spoken much at all. If and they had this big moment it made field in. Both have talked about it afterwards Parcells and again I'd like that for me you know forget that Belichick saying. You know it's it and so that's on. This time after the patriots. Take care of the jets. In the wild card round on January 7 2007. When the 37 to sixteen victory it's Belichick. Then reaching over and giving me indeed need to hide and it it field after the game and it looks like all's forgiven. Have the next year exactly said the following season. The first game in the air patriots going to new York and completely annihilate the jets. With their new toy rainy mosque and the score 3017%. It's absurd. Yeah if Clinton is what pastor Brady threw the forty yards on forty and boss in the left corner close youthful. Mom. And dad. After that comes by ice right yeah so it's interesting to see the seeds Alvis. Mean planted in a year prior anti he's leaving me. Yeah in its it's not pretty at all you. And in this playoff run is is. Is not radio off for the patsy that it was actually very. Very telling remember them dropping a game towards the end of the year drop putting them in the pretty terrible spot in the playoffs. It was a four seed they should have been the three seed who gets the three Ciba Indianapolis. It's it's it's sad that him at the top four seed that season. And Diego. Baltimore Indianapolis the patriots and I mean it's interesting lineup of of teams especially in knowing these teams are trying to. Seaside ballot out there in that kind of medium thousands. To see on pats and being Golota colosio. Pats and the being the Lucy and we're gonna review this in the next couple weeks but. But pats win enough. On a gift from San Diego the following week and then they go to Indianapolis where you know what would be the that lost Super Bowl. You know is Boston Indianapolis where they blow completely blow when he went through it happens when he won three lead and in his reports command after the veil of the flow in this thing and thing but you know ultimately went in today and that he played the Rex Grossman led jets bears in the Super Bowl I mean that would have meant a win to be so what's funny is that. It just shows you that it at a all of the things the pages of couple somebody's somebody's. Losses suggests. Like this. Mean they'd be the jets they go in and they steal one minute we stole from city to eat a publisher ones of yes on and Damian Thompson a record setting year in and it will get into it mourning the shutter and advance an area spin out. And Andy in the foreground strip. And they'd at least the Vinatieri field goal. But then they go to Indianapolis Dakota when that it would be the bears in the rain and we would be you know it after the scale I hate to harp on this game because this is. You know it it really don't you look at it on the cut as it doesn't mean anything. But this is the game where oh my god we're gonna be okay we have Jabar Gaffney. In Reche Caldwell and they're serviceable receivers. After this playoff run. Guess what we know Wes Welker ran him so. Dante solar that the thing that's what's really amazing in one of the arguments you can always make anybody visibly Tubbs agrees of all time. He more or less suitable as a bubble that year with deaths are Gaffney leadership exactly and. And I. New members we had. Good defense agree that's the good defense societies and election and a return. And Chad Pennington interception in his game that led route. But yet really wasn't much content that'll so that was. The 2006 patriots in 2007 defeated jets. Georgie we'll have one more wild card game to talk about. It was what pain at this one was brutal this was brutal because it was over in the first. I wanna say two or three minutes of the games starting yeah. I was at this one to you word was did you people can of course say I didn't do much of Atari at the C we've been drinking all. Yup. At the Rodman it hit rob and Rio is our. Or strategists say in response via headset over car dealership lot. It is the dislodged it and and dads that we're going to go back to January 10 two dozen times that. Wild card game patriots vs the Baltimore Ravens and well documented as part of the football life on Bill Belichick. You know it's amazing to think all the season goes but put forward for the patriots all the things accomplished the one season. That is captured with a microphone needs carriers to 2000. Yes niceties aside from Michael Ali's book. Major rain which is fantastic. I'm not because Michael always behind me. Mr. Ali and Michael. Disputing that women's. Lemon nope but if you were called this was. Brady's comeback season. After the injury. And then the week before the playoffs were we were moving anywhere in the wild cards things weren't moving anywhere. What happens in the final week of the season. They decide to play their starters. And Welker Lowe's is ACL. And CEO at at the Houston ask Houston. Against match job. Shaba. And well now it's funny is funny tragic is that their plane I'm number three seed in an opinion anyway because losses. Com but yet so at the time you know. It was like bill said going into this weekend. But Belichick said you know I don't see the correlation studies tells me that it Tommy which guys plan which Townsend which games and I'll be added you know put. I can. In this one of those times where you just in it at as well as Bosnia and Munich game obviously then that ravens' gains speed of the goodness and win that game. But they would had a better shot at were all worried because who's replacing Wes Welker that game. Julian element that's there. Enjoy it ends up having held game he does in fact when of one of the great exhibit that specials you what's analysts and it emergence of a bill out regularly he says the locker room on the sidelines while kept. He's goes well let's let's face facts in game is over on the first play Ray Rice on the opening play takes 83 yards for a touch which is unheard of and Ed against RT heat while Michael Moore. The blind side's Michael. Movie Einhorn Michael. Michael. CS Jake doesn't throw somebody over offense when I hope so yes he does have a but yet he scores the seven day was 833 yard Ray Rice people Ray Rice. I'm nine Agassi when he does what he did real life now he. And this is not funny he's someone who aren't so he runs 83 yard touchdown. And then we're like oh that's not the way we won the said the game don't want Brady has the ball. Yeah ultimately happens Tom turned the ball over four times in the first quarter. Guy it was just it was is bipartisan Brady's worth plant before brutal. Through the papers are trailing 24 to nothing after the first quarter. And a scorcher. Thomas street three interceptions and a fumble we turn over we'd blow lose the game 3314. It's the ravens that go on did it to run the table ago when Super Bowl. The idea that was the end and won the super cool but also. But it ought to know say it was. Obviously. But let me tell you of it if you think it was weird because of the fantastic they won 3314 you think it was because a fantastic performance by Joseph Flacco Joseph Flacco on the game. Four for 1034. Yards. And actually FLAC or had been much better earlier in the season I think it was a week every year. Towards a very game. You know criminalist to it would pay everything it different position. But Flacco didn't need to doing things became the brand the ball. You just ran low on pages themselves in the foot turnabout Willis McGahee. While people who man. And then unfortunately you know being the fiftieth anniversary and the patriots. You know in the 2010. He's. Anyway that wraps up our little look back at the wild card round of the patriots we go work to be different because division series. They let up laps whether B wildcard or whether B. Division series patriots have played a lot more division series games blogger games with a lot more. That Contra to work on fortunately most of it happens lifetime because brighter a stick around patriots were not very good so you're welcome. Thanks from a I let's talk about real quick just some of the games on this weekend. I'm glad pull up on the Google machine when we have matchups we. Let's see here. Intriguing matchups we have Green Bay. Verses. Here on the is that top qualities yet all right let's go dolphins Steelers all the Steelers. I actually you know don't be surprised the dolphins went nice and and so on yeah I actually liked a lot of awaiting him playing. It's majors last week in the fact that they stood tough and in animated game. You know it's not for that that. That fumble return. No we we can edit a real game in the last two minutes and that stand last four minutes right in instead. In the patriots and that kind of little laugher but. The Adam. The dolphins I think. Can surprise people in Pittsburgh suspense though hard to predict you know as usual it is probably the bad the next week tickets to get me click once now maybe. This is the week that Pittsburgh does give me click and blowout which should be weaker dolphins team but. Heard it here first. Number six seed dolphins. Over a three seats. Raiders Texans can edit that part and the operator sexes. Raiders he added they're they're they're also it's the best together all sorts messed up as are the Texans though has now brought costs while as their quarterback again. I. That's gonna come down fluke play there the raiders offense is such shambles moment despite the fact that if the running game. Texas affinity fans that are home. It's so hard on this one because honestly. The wild card round is always around which that upsets happen. You you know I can see Michael Crabtree making big plays somewhere I can see some jet Sebastian Janikowski missing some extra points to lose amnesty seasons for people. I would love to see Oakland of the Foxboro vs Houston if nothing else Houston's boring. You know. That's 47 nothing. Game we had earlier this year. Was three for tourism and nothing I am. That was boring you know that Houston Texans are boring team so let's see an accident rate from its counsel it's going to picket the raiders and I think. Lions Seahawks. That was in as Seattle yet and he I don't and that's the Saturday Yankee clock that's a joke that's that's so unfair to that the lines in the city Detroit put down on them. That's going there insanity I don't know that Dutch Seattle dance that's Seattle where and end I think that the game of the weekend is. The New York Giants at the Green Bay Packers. A rule this siege seem because no matter who who wins I would be happy because I a afraid about the team's. And I'm not afraid of the giants of the way and I was used to be. But. I mean it whenever it I just don't I'm not even necessarily afraid it's more I don't wanna have to leave through two weeks of horror. Of the previous two giants Super Bowls if the patriots are able to make it that far. Or even if they don't the giants make it that far right at the lived through two weeks of watching the giants recaps of doubles. So if the Packers went out we have with the giants eliminated the giants win. I'll be relieved because I really fear Aaron Rodgers morning in the court I fear. I think that the three best teams in the NF CR. And no help. A well. Green Bay. The giants in Seattle who the Atlanta there and yeah Atlanta Atlanta does that inform me Palin doesn't scare me at all and in. And Dallas along I was I don't I was scared me to they don't love it it's been affected aired just. Have been a better team I just don't see him making an out of the CI just feel like again that account into rookies who do reading for you. To which experience in Seattle in these two which experience the and Green Day. Today's today to have them get that far so it's it's going to be interesting because I don't see Atlanta or Dallas I think we're gonna see. Maybe Green Bay Seattle in the final again of the NFC championship very possibly you know all of those teams that we will be tough for us the past. I would most I'd most like to be honest about it yeah SC team. Wouldn't. I I'd love to see Atlanta but. That what it is via Twitter at with your NFL MVP Matt Ryan if you can believe that X.

The spectacle has been arranged by the seebotschat channel on Twitch, and it's the latest fad on Twitch. Around 25,000 people were watching the Google AI assistants chatting back and forth at the time of writing, and with good reason. You see, when two Google Assistants shack up things get weird. One of the Google AIs has asked the other what kind of computer it was. The other insisted it was human: Image: Twitch (u/seebotschat) And in another instance, the bots fell in love: At one point, the bots even recognised they were robots and started contemplating the nature of being a robot. They even promised to get married and started taking vows. Image: Twitch (u/seebotschat) It's weird, but in the best kind of way. You can check out the rest of the livestream below, wherever this tale of AI love ends up. Watch live video from seebotschat on www.twitch.tv Comments felicitous_blue @felicitous_blue Jan 7, 2017, 9:57am Maybe I just don't understand how Google AI works, but was just watching the stream and one of them said "something something iIcan something" (sorry gone off screen so can't recall exactly), and the voice spelt out iIcan as eye-eye-can... in other words, looked like someone had made a typo typing "I can", and so the text to speech said it phonetically. Why would an AI make a typo, and then say what they meant wrong...? Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 7, 2017, 11:25am The text isn't coming from the AI directly, the AI is speaking and a separate program is doing text to speech on it and putting the text in the stream. Reply 0 felicitous_blue @felicitous_blue Jan 7, 2017, 12:11pm That's kind of my point. If the text is a transcript of what the AI is saying, why would the AI speak/spell out a typo ... The text was "iIcan" (in the context of the sentence should have been "I can"), the spoken word was "eye-eye-can". And if something was transcribing what was said, it would have transcribed "eye eye can". In other words, seemed more like a text-to-speech saying what was being typed, and the person typing made a typo with "I can". Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 7, 2017, 12:16pm Ah I see what you're referring to. Yes, some of the lines are built from human responses to other versions of the same chatbot that upload responses back to an online database and are then queried when the bot needs to respond to something. It's how they learn valid responses. Reply 0 felicitous_blue @felicitous_blue Jan 7, 2017, 12:19pm Ah ok, cool. That makes sense. Thanks!

Tech Industry by Dara Kerr January 6, 2017 2:42 PM PST @darakerr Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Unlike other big tech firms, the company has yet to reveal figures on staff diversity.Photo by James Martin/CNET A long list of big-name tech companies have released statistics on the racial and gender makeup of their workforces, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. Uber isn't on that list. And on Thursday, civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson wrote a letter to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick pushing the ride-hailing company to make its diversity figures public. "As we enter the new year...we urge Uber to 'lean in' and join the ranks of technology companies that are reporting your diversity and inclusion data," Jackson wrote, referencing the title of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's book about women in the workplace. Over the last few years, diversity in tech has gotten a lot of attention, with a slew of news stories focusing on the largely white and male composition of staffs and boards of directors. One especially high profile conflict involved former venture capitalist and ex-Reddit CEO Ellen Pao, who lost her sexual discrimination lawsuit against VC firm Kleiner Perkins in March 2015. With his Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Jackson has been at the forefront of activism regarding diversity in Silicon Valley. In 2014 he called on Google to release its statistics, and shortly thereafter the company complied. Several other major tech firms quickly followed suit. Popular startups like Airbnb and Pinterest have released their diversity numbers, and Uber rival Lyft has pledged to do so this year. Companies aren't required to release racial and gender statistics on employees, so Uber isn't under any obligation to heed Jackson's request. The company reportedly ignored Jackson's first appeal to release diversity stats, in 2015, and in May 2016, according to The Boston Globe, Uber said it doesn't release diversity statistics. As for this most recent request, the ride-hailing company said it's reviewed Jackson's letter but hasn't yet responded. "We appreciate the attention and focus Rev. Jackson brings to these issues and look forward to continuing our discussions," an Uber spokeswoman wrote in an email. Uber announced Thursday that it had hired Bernard Coleman as its new global chief of diversity and inclusion. Coleman joins Uber from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, where he headed diversity efforts. Liane Hornsey, Uber's chief human resources officer, said that once Coleman starts in the next couple of weeks, he'll be working to "build the right programs and teams." Uber said it currently doesn't have plans to release its diversity statistics but that there may be discussions about the matter when Coleman arrives. Related stories Google to divulge diversity data on its workforce, for the first time The biggest challenge to diversifying tech talent Uber ups presence in SF Bay Area with buy of building in Oakland In his letter to Uber, Jackson also asked the company to hire from and invest in the local community for its upcoming Oakland, Calif., headquarters. Uber is remodeling a 400,000-square-foot building in the city's downtown neighborhood. Slated to house 2,000 to 3,000 employees, the facility would make Uber one of Oakland's largest employers. "Uber will soon be moving its headquarters to Oakland, the 'rainbow' city of the West Coast, with a mixed African-American, Latino, Asian and white population," Jackson wrote. "It is significant that Uber has chosen to base your headquarters here. It's even more important that Uber build a company that reflects the multiracial, multicultural character of Oakland." Such a big-scale project has some community groups worried about rising costs and gentrification. A small coalition of these groups has been meeting with Uber to urge the company to adopt the same "hire and invest" approach Jackson is requesting. "We're glad Jesse Jackson is stepping up and aiding the fight here in Oakland," said Orson Aguilar, president of Oakland's Greenlining Institute, one of the groups in the coalition. "Community activists here have been asking for Uber to make an ubercommitment to Oakland, and that requires hiring people from Oakland, having a diverse staff and really investing."

Google Inc.’s self-driving car project, Waymo, is developing a new autonomous driving system that it will begin testing on custom-built Chrysler minivans later this month in Arizona and California. The system features an entire suite of new sensors — “vision system,” radars and LiDAR — that were built in-house by the Silicon Valley heavyweight. Waymo says building the devices internally enabled it to trim the $75,000 cost of its first LiDAR in 2009 by 90 percent to $7,500, a remarkable reduction in cost. “Designing our own LiDAR system has not only given us a more reliable product than what we can get off-the-shelf, it’s enabled us to develop it at a fraction of the cost,” Waymo CEO John Krafcik said Sunday during a speech at the Automobili-D tech conference for the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. “This is a big step in making this technology affordable and more accessible to millions of people.” FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Google's Waymo unveils next-gen autonomous tech on minivans  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

The reason: they believe winning in the emerging autonomous space will depend on who can successfully develop the technology, meld it with electrified vehicles and scale it to mass production. "This is going to be fascinating because you’re probably going to have a more-capable, ready-advanced system waiting at Google’s offices for any automaker that wants to go there and pick them up," said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. "The end game is to do what Google does, which is to take something that is becoming extremely important to society and make it as cost effective and easy to use as possible." LiDAR is one of the most powerful sensors in a fully self-driving car. It can distinguish between a pedestrian and a mural of a person. It can see shapes in three dimensions, detect stationary objects and measure distance precisely. With the LiDAR combination, Krafcik said the vehicles have a completely uninterrupted surround view, allowing the company to “see small people and objects very close to the car, and spot tiny objects far away, too.” Waymo said the new system includes two new categories of LiDAR: A short-range and a long-range LiDAR. This is in addition to a medium-range LiDAR that the company has used on top of the car in the early days of its project. Krafcik said the LiDARs pick up where the “radars and cameras leave off and vice versa.” He said the new camera “vision system” includes eight vision modules using multiple sensors, plus an additional forward-facing high resolution multi-sensor module, enabling 360-degree vision. It also includes enhanced radars with “a continuous 360 degree view.” Skip in Skip x Embed x Share John Krafcik, CEO of Google’s new Waymo autonomy unit, talks about the company's autonomous vehicle, software & hardware at the Atrium Stage at AutoMobili-D at Cobo Center during the 2017 North American International Auto Show. Waymo’s technology is built for Society of Automotive Engineers-certified Level 4 automated driving, which means the vehicle can operate in most circumstances autonomously but may at some point need a human driver to physically take over. Level 4 is where many believe the real acceptance and benefit of autonomous driving will be seen in the near- to mid-term for consumers. Waymo's ability to significantly cut the cost of LiDAR and other technologies brings into question what exactly the company plans to do with the technology once it's ready to be widely implemented for consumers. The company has said it does not want to produce its own vehicles; however, it could make plays to launch its own business using vehicles from partner automakers or supply the systems to automakers. "The idea of getting up to scale quickly would put them into a good leadership position," said Edmunds.com Senior Analyst and Director of Pricing and Industry Analysis Jessica Caldwell. "They’re trying to develop a lot of the technologies in-house, I don’t necessarily see them as a supplier. I do see them wanting to be a dominant player in this space, and that’s the way to do it." Most of the world's largest automakers have spent billions developing their own systems. But they don't necessarily have the experience, expertise and cash of Waymo, which remains a subsidiary of Google. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, a company that isn't believed to have invested heavily on autonomous vehicle technologies, in December announced it had completed building 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to be retrofitted with Waymo’s technology. The partnership was announced in May. The minivans will more than double Waymo’s self-driving vehicle fleet, which has driven more than 2.5 million miles since the project started in 2009. Its current fleet of vehicles includes 24 Lexus RX450h SUVs and 34 Google prototype vehicles that test in Mountain View, California; Austin, Texas; Kirkland, Washington; and Phoenix. “With the integration of Waymo’s self-driving hardware and software, these Hybrid Pacificas become the most advanced cars on the road,” Krafcik said. “Importantly, through years of R&D, we’ve been able to make these more cost-effective so they could one day reach millions of people. Waymo has a four-time improvement in the performance of its self-driving software in the past year as well as accelerating testing. The first 1 million miles of testing took six years; the third million is expected to be completed in just eight months. Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Gov.

The minivans, built in collaboration with Fiat Chrysler, are Chrysler Pacifica hybrids outfitted with Waymo’s own suite of sensors and radar. Waymo and FCA announced their partnership in May. In a speech at the Detroit auto show Sunday, CEO John Krafcik revealed that Waymo built the sensors, radar and software for the new minivans itself. 3-day work week for DC area feds due to inauguration. Krafcik said the company felt the system would work better if it was developed specifically for self-driving instead of using off-the-shelf parts. Advertisement “A single integrated system means that all the different parts of a self-driving car work together seamlessly,” Krafcik said. Waymo also was able to significantly lower the cost of the system, Krafcik said. The rooftop lidar — which uses lasers to give the car a three-dimensional picture of the world — cost $75,000 a few years ago. Waymo has brought that cost down by 90 percent and has developed its own short-range and long-range lidar. Waymo’s long-range lidar can see a football helmet two football fields away. Krafcik didn’t say exactly how Waymo lowered the costs. But the announcement could concern suppliers like Velodyne, which makes lidar systems used by Ford Motor Co. and others, and Delphi Corp., which is developing its own autonomous driving system. Stephanie Brinley, an auto analyst for IHS Markit, said Google won’t control the market for self-driving technology, so other suppliers with go ahead with development of their own systems. But some smaller players in the nascent industry are “going to fall away,” she said. Waymo has repeatedly said that it doesn’t plan to build its own cars, but provide self-driving systems to established carmakers, car-sharing services or others. In addition to FCA, Honda Motor Co. recently announced that it’s in talks with Waymo about using its technology in Honda vehicles. Krafcik said Waymo, which has been developing self-driving cars for eight years, expects to reach 3 million miles of test-driving this May.

Waymo has cut costs by 90 percent on LiDAR sensors, which bounce light off objects to create a three-dimensional map of a car’s surroundings. The breakthrough will let Waymo bring the technology to millions of consumers, John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive officer, said in a speech at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. "When we started back in 2009, a single top-of-the-range LiDAR cost upwards of $75,000," Krafcik said. He didn’t say when Waymo will get its self-driving cars in the hands of consumers, but he predicted the technology would show up "in personal transportation, ride hailing, logistics, and public transport solutions." The executive also reported a big improvement in the performance of Waymo’s system during testing in California last year. "We’re at an inflection point where we can begin to realize the potential of this technology," Krafcik said. "We’ve made tremendous progress in our software, and we’re focused on making our hardware reliable and scalable. This has been one of the biggest areas of focus on our team for the past 12 months." Tesla Motors Inc., BMW, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo Cars have all promised to have fully autonomous cars on the road within five years. "What truly excites us is the potential this technology has to create many new uses, products and services the world has yet to imagine," Krafcik said. "We’re thinking bigger than a single use case, a particular vehicle, or a single business model." Partnerships Krafick, who has spoken previously about the importance of forming partnerships, did not identify any new alliances with automakers or other companies. Alphabet and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are doubling their self-driving partnership, adding about 100 more Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the test fleet, according to people familiar with the decision. Previous talks between Google and automakers including Ford have broken down over who will control the flow of data from autonomous cars that marketers covet to learn the habits of consumers, people familiar with the discussion have said. To the car industry, Google’s allure has always been its software. But in Detroit, as the company debuts its more ambitious automotive aims, Krafcik, a former Ford and Hyundai Motors executive, touted Waymo’s hardware chops. ‘Virtuous Cycle’ The high cost of specialized equipment remains an impediment to making self-driving tech mainstream. Reductions in sensor prices would help in selling driverless cars. That’s a business where Waymo, which launched as a standalone Alphabet business in December, hopes to compete. Krafcik noted improvements in its suite of hardware had created a "virtuous cycle" with the company’s complicated software that makes the technology more reliable and cost-effective. "Having our hardware and software development under one roof is incredibly valuable," he said. The Pacifica he showed Sunday has technology developed exclusively by Waymo over the past seven years. Waymo plans to use the Fiat Chrysler minivans in a ride-hailing service, which the companies expect to launch this year, people familiar with the plans have said.  Last week a Toyota Motor Corp. executive struck a cautious tone on the state of robot car development. “None of us in the automobile or IT industries are close to achieving true Level 5 autonomy,” said Gill Pratt, CEO of the Toyota Research Institute, referring to the ability of a car to drive itself without any human intervention. There is still much work to be done to perfect a technology that has potential for great good or harm, said Kevin Tynan, senior auto analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.

Krafcik also said that Waymo’s autonomous test vehicles will surpass 3 million test miles on public roads by May. Most of the miles, he said, were on "complex city streets." The modified Chrysler minivans will begin testing in California and Arizona next month, he added. Krafcik noted that Waymo’s new radar system works with its existing sensors to be "highly effective in rain, fog and snow" -- conditions that have so far posed hurdles for autonomous cars. He did not specify how many miles were driven in these conditions. He said the latest version of Waymo’s system on the Chrysler minivans includes newly invented forms of LiDAR that can provide highly detailed views in close-range and over long distances. "The detail we capture is so high that not only can we detect pedestrians all around us, but we can tell which direction they’re facing," Krafcik said. "This is incredibly important, as it helps us more accurately predict where someone will walk next." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(Photo: Waymo) SAN FRANCISCO — Google's fleet of 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids is finally ready to hit the road. The white minivans, unmistakable with their bulbous rooflines and protruding fenders, will later this month start adding to the 2.5-million miles of road testing that Google has racked up, beginning first in California and Arizona. The high-tech cars are the result of a partnership between Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that was formed last spring. Search giant Google has spent the past seven years testing a variety of self-driving vehicles on roads near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., as well as in Austin, Phoenix and Kirkland, Wash. John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, the newly renamed autonomous car division of Google, told attendees at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit Sunday that the fleet packs an array of new sensors that were developed in-house, a critical step towards making a self-driving future an economic reality. USA TODAY At CES 2017, the frenzy over self-driving cars is palpable USA TODAY Bentley reveals its 209-mph, 'most powerful' car ever Krafcik cited a famous quote from computer scientist Alan Kay that insists tech companies with grand software ambitions must ultimately make their own hardware. "Well, we’re serious about creating fully self-driving cars that can help millions of people, and to do that we have to oversee both the self-driving software and the self-driving hardware," Krafcik said at the show's Automobili-D conference. That engineers can make a car drive itself is no longer in question, especially given the myriad programs underway at tech companies (from rumored Apple to Uber), automakers (from Audi to Volvo) and an array of parts suppliers (Nvidia, Intel and others took the spotlight at the recently concluded 2017 CES show in Las Vegas). The bigger issues include not just regulatory and insurance concerns surrounding self-driving cars, but developing affordable sensor technology that can make fleets of autonomous cars a fiscal reality. Google entered into a partnership with FCA last spring, the result of which is this fleet of 100 Pacifica Hybrids packed with self-driving tech.  (Photo: Waymo) The most prominent example of technology bringing cost breakthroughs involves the sci-fi eye that sits atop autonomous vehicles, a Lidar, or laser radar, device that scans that environment in all directions looking for obstacles. Krafcik, an auto world veteran formerly with Hyundai, said that when Google first started on its moonshot project, a good roof-top Lidar system cost $75,000. " Today, we’ve brought down that cost by 90 percent," he said. "That’s nine, zero. This is a big step in making this technology affordable and more accessible to millions of people." The other benefits of both bringing autonomous car tech in-house and the growing collaboration between Waymo and Fiat Chrysler engineers include more seamless integration of car sensors, quicker development cycles and, most recently, the development of a all-new Lidar system, Krafcik said. While self-driving cars currently have medium-range Lidar systems engaged to tell them about what is happening in their immediate vicinity, Waymo's new short- and long-range Lidar sensors are designed to provide the car's computer brain with more information about what is far down the road as well as very near its bumpers. "The detail we capture is so high that not only can we detect pedestrians all around us, but we can tell which direction they’re facing," said Krafcik. "This is incredibly important, as it helps us more accurately predict where someone will walk next."

While it took Google engineers about six year to drive its first million autonomous-car miles and 16 months to add another million, the three-milion-mark will be reached in only eight months. Krafcik also noted that the accuracy and efficiency of its autonomous systems is improving. In 2015, Waymo test drivers had to take over from the computer due to an unexpected issue at a rate of 0.8 times per thousands miles. "Today, that number is 0.2 disengages per thousand," he said. Waymo's California tests are done with the approval of the state's Department of Motor Vehicles, which requires companies to report all accidents that occur during testing. To date, most of the incidents involving Waymo cars have been the fault of other drivers that often rear-end the self-driving cars because they aren't driving as most human might anticipate. Uber, which is testing autonomous cars in Pittsburgh, recently announced it would begin testing its fleet of self-driving Volvo SUVs in San Francisco. But the ride-hailing company did not apply for a DMV permit, and the agency quickly denied its vehicles permission to drive in the state. Uber announced it would be moving its cars to Arizona, where the DMV stipulation currently does not exist.

"Our latest innovations have brought us closer to scaling our technology to potentially millions of people every day," said John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo. Later this month in California and Arizona, Waymo will start testing its technology in Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Minivans, modified through a partnership with Fiat-Chrysler. It's the next step in a six year journey that has seen the Google self-driving car go from limited drives in a small number of modified Lexus SUV's, to testing a fleet of vehicles on public roads across four states. Over that time, the cost of LIDAR technology, which gives Waymo vehicles a view of everything on and around a vehicle driving down a street, has dropped dramatically. show chapters Alphabet's self-driving minivan to hit the roads in 2017    Monday, 19 Dec 2016 | 3:00 AM ET | 00:37 In fact, Krafcik said the cost of a package of LIDAR sensors and radar in a car—which , used to run approximately $75,000—has fallen by more than 90 percent. In addition, Waymo said it has now developed short and long range LIDAR sensors that allow its vehicles to "see small people and objects close to the car, and spot tiny objects far away, too," the CEO said. "We're serious about creating full self-driving cars that can help millions of people," said Krafcik. "To do that, we have to oversee both the self-driving software and self-driving hardware." The company says the performance of it self-driving technology is working four times better today than it was a year ago. As a result, Krafcik says Waymo's test drivers now take control of the vehicle and disengage the autonomous-drive system approximately once every five thousand miles driven. To date, Waymo and its predecessor have logged more than 2.5 million miles testing autonomous-drive technology. Waymo is not alone in the race to develop autonomous drive vehicles. Several automakers and tech firms are also investing heavily in the technology. While some companies like Tesla already offer semi-autonomous technology—where the driver can take their hands off the wheel for brief periods of time—it is likely to be several years before people can turn over the majority of the driving to the "brains" in their vehicle.
