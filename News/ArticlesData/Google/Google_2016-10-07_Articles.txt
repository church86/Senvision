The expectation and the hope is that Google probably would let bygones be bygones, but the messaging and texting app may not have a foot in the door in just a couple of months. In fact, on December 1, Google will actually remove Hangouts from the core Google Mobile Services package and replace the app with its new video chatting service, Duo. The “gapps” package is what gets pre-loaded from Google on all Android smartphones. The change was announced in an email obtained by Android Police. “Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products,” Google stated. That means that manufacturers can opt to have the app pre-loaded with the rest of the package, but, as David Ruddock points out: There’s also no guarantee that manufacturers will stop bundling the Hangouts app on their devices, but I would strongly assume that’s likely – OEMs and mobile operators want to push their own messaging solutions, or those of partners paying for placement on their devices, and Hangouts was competition. Interestingly, Allo is not required in the GMS package, though it may be more complicated to sell as a chat app than Google’s own barebones, SMS-based Messenger app — yet, it’s also not in gapps. Google claims that Hangouts for Android will still receive support as the product is right now, though we could see more changes that could suit it for business as opposed to general communications.

On the plus side, Google has made some fantastic (review pending) phones that can easily stand toe to toe with any flagship out there. With a premium look and feel and specs to match, Google has now joined the OEM community with a very strong entry. And with that strong entry comes a strong price tag. The Pixel phones are pricey. A base model costs the same as a base model iPhone, and a base model Galaxy S7. Gone are the days when Google could be counted on to release a good phone with a great price. But looking at the landscape these days, I’m not so sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. Now, it’s true that I wrote a few days ago that Google picked the wrong time to make an expensive phone. But that was based solely on the concept of price. Let’s look at the bigger picture. Stock or die Google has built a bit of a reputation for bringing good phones to the market to serve as a showcase of how Android “should be”. In a world of Android skins ranging from Touchwiz to EMUI, Google needs a showcase of Android as it is intended to be. Developers rely on a stock Android experience with fast updates to make sure their apps continue to function properly with updates as they’re released. There’s a reason Developer Previews are made available early – so when Android O comes out, the fit doesn’t hit the shan. So can developers really be expected to pick up hardware costing over $600 to develop their free face switcher app? That seems a bit much. On iOS, a developer can pick up an iPhone 6 for a couple of Benjamins. They can count on the fact that their app will run pretty much the same on it as it does on an iPhone 7. So what’s an Android Dev to do? Strong competition But more than that, and to be fair I’ve already made this argument in my other article so I’m not going to repeat every point here, but with so many great sub-$400 phones out there, why is Google suddenly upping its price game? The current crop of smartphones out there seems to be right in Google’s wheelhouse, but instead it’s swinging for the fences. That doesn’t make any sense And yet… Until you consider what Google’s ultimate goal might be here. Maybe Google isn’t competing against other midrange phones because it doesn’t want to compete against midrange phones. Maybe Google is focusing on developing a consumer product, rather than a developer product. If that’s the case, suddenly Google’s specs and price points make a heck of a lot more sense. Plus, let’s consider the fact that the Nexus line of phones hasn’t always been so low priced. Starting the with the Nexus 6 and moving forward to the 5X and the 6P, we haven’t really been seeing a lot of super low prices. The Nexus 5 may have been the last of that line. Anecdotally, when I look around, I see a lot more Nexus 5X and 6P phones around than I’ve ever seen previous Nexus phones. The consumer world has taken notice of Google’s offerings and started to buy them. It makes sense that Google would want to up its game in that arena. Going home Plus, the Pixel phone is Google’s first hardware showcase for Google Assistant, which is the direction Google wants to go. Sundar Pichai said he wants to create a personal Google for everyone in the world, and Google Assistant is a means to do so. With devices like the Google Home coming out to complement Google Assistant, Google’s initial offering to consumers has to be a consumer product – not a phone for techies and geeks, lest that the be extent of Google Assistant’s usefulness. Google Assistant is a mostly untested product, but Google seems to have a lot riding on it. To hamstring the service by offering it on a midrange phone when most people are running to Samsung and Apple, would make the service pretty much DOA. At least now with the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google can make a solid case to pick up its phone with Google Assistant, rather than the Note 7 which comes with a built in hand warmer. Oh no he didn’t. Oh yes he did. Sound off So what do you think? Is Google shooting itself in the foot with these lofty prices? Or is Google simply switching its focus from developers to consumers, and adjusting its strategy to match? Now, don’t be salty that the phone costs a lot – it’s easy to do. But focus on the big picture here, let me know what you think in the comments, and let’s see if we can figure this out. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

There’s nothing on the router’s spec sheet that just quite mentions what’s going on with the power adapter, — other than it has a 15W maximum, but the device only consumes 9W — but Leung announced that USB-C connectors are on the adapt. In fact, its configured to the same 5V, 3A spec that Google chose for the Pixel C. “You could just as easily use [the adapter] to charge one of your new Type-C phones,” Leung posted on his Google+ page, “and conversely, use your phone’s 15W power adapter to power Google WiFi.” Source: Google+, Google Via: juggly.cn (Google Translate) Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

A shoplifter was caught and then prosecuted for stealing £60 ($104) of washing-up goods after she was photographed fleeing a store on Google Street View. Tammy McIvor, from Middlesbrough, can be seen running from discount store Savers in the town with a member of staff chasing her. Images of the robbery were stumbled across by an IT worker who saw McIvor sprinting out of the North Yorkshire shop while looking through the town online on the app. She was pictured by the camera which had been taking shots in the street, exiting from the store with her stolen goods in a Sports Direct carrier bag. Store bosses were able to identify the 30-year-old from the Google Street View stills. Although, as per Google policy, her face was blurred they were able to identify her from her distinctive white top she was wearing. She wore the same outfit when she was arrested. 'I'm an ex-Teesside University student so I thought I would see my old stomping ground, and as soon as I spotted it I thought 'that seemed a bit strange,' said Peter Darby, an IT worker who came across the images. 'I moved further down the street and you could see a bloke pursuing her. By the end she was going full speed. Continued below.

'She was running around with the Sports Direct bag and it was obvious she was up to no good.' The images were filmed on June 19 in the town center at around 2.45pm. She pleaded guilty to theft at Teeside magistrates court last week and was given a year-long community order, which has a drug rehabilitation requirement. The court heard McIvor has a long history of offending and drug abuse including a stint in prison in 2013 for burgling two properties in one night. The women, who has been a heroin addict since 16, also took drugs in prison and used someone else's name to get out of trouble. After the case, a friend of McIvor, said: 'She's harmless but she gets into trouble for shoplifting quite a bit. 'A lot of the shops in Middlesbrough and Stockton already know her and look out for her, but she's never been caught like this before. ' Google's camera equipped cars aim to build reliable maps by taking 360 degree images of cities, towns and villages across the world.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Battle of Google’s phablets: Pixel XL vs. Nexus 6P Julian Chokkattu Digital TrendsOctober 8, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google is now a hardware company, apparently. The search giant unveiled several products at its recent event in San Francisco, California, two of which are new smartphones — the Pixel and Pixel XL. Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — oh my! Everything Google revealed at its Oct. 4 event Google has “no plans” to produce another smartphone from its Nexus line, and that’s because the Pixel line marks the first time the device is completely “made by Google.” The smartphones feature tight hardware and software integration. If you have a Nexus 6P, you may be considering an upgrade to the Pixel XL. Below is our breakdown and analysis of the two Google heavyweight phablets, which can help you decide if you should cough up the dough to join Google’s new Pixel lineup. Performance Nexus 6P Google Pixel XL Size 6.27 × 3.06 × 0.29 inches (159.3 x 77.8 x 7.3mm) 6.0 x 2.9 x 0.2-0.34 inches (154.7 x 75.7 x 7.3-8.5mm) Weight 178 grams (6.28 ounces) 168 grams (5.93 ounces) Screen 5.7-inch AMOLED 5.5-inch AMOLED Resolution 1,440 × 2,560 pixels (515 ppi) 1,440 x 2,560 pixels (534 ppi) OS Android 7.0 Nougat (will receive Android 7.1 Nougat) Android 7.1 Nougat Storage 32GB, 64GB, 128GB 32, 128GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 RAM 3GB 4GB Connectivity GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE Camera 12MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 8MP front Video 4K 4K Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer Accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer Water resistant No No Battery 3,450mAh 3,450mAh Ports USB-C, headphone jack USB-C, headphone jack Marketplace Google Play Google Play Color offerings Silver, black, white, gold Very Silver, Quite Black, Really Blue Availability Google Store unlocked Google Store unlocked, Verizon Price Starts at $500 Starts at $770 DT review Nexus 6P review Coming soon Yearly upgrades often don’t produce great differences in terms of hardware performance, and that’s reflective in the internals of the Pixel XL. It shares almost the same specs as last year’s Nexus 6P, except for a few improvements. The Pixel XL is a little smaller than the Nexus 6P, thanks to its 5.5-inch display. This means it’s a little lighter as well. The Nexus 6P has 3GB of RAM, but the Pixel XL adds an extra gigabyte. Both devices have 32 and 128GB storage options, but there is no 64GB model for the Pixel XL. Related: Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Hands on with Google’s latest and Android 7.1 The Pixel XL features the latest processor from Qualcomm — the Snapdragon 821. In fact, it’s the first device in the U.S. to feature the processor, which is said to improve performance by 10 percent  over the Snapdragon 820. But the Nexus 6P is powered by the Snapdragon 810, an outdated processor by 2016’s standards. That’s not to say the Snapdragon 810 in the Nexus 6P doesn’t perform well. You won’t have any issues, but note that the Pixel XL features tight hardware and software integration. It’s unlike the Nexus line, where the software was designed by Google and the hardware was made by a third-party manufacturer. HTC is the manufacturer for the Pixel XL, with Google choosing the components to work with its operating system — similar to how Apple works with Foxconn to build the iPhone. You’re undoubtedly going to notice that Android performs better on the Pixel XL than on the Nexus 6P, thanks to these software and hardware integrations. Winner: Pixel XL Design, display, and durability Here’s the more subjective comparison. Personal preference applies to which smartphone looks the best, but we can say the Pixel XL felt a lot more comfortable to hold than the Nexus 6P. Its edges are more rounded and smooth. We like the “G” branding more than the large “Nexus” branding on the back of the device, and the half-glass back is certainly unique. The Nexus 6P offers stereo front-facing speakers, but the Pixel only has a speaker at the bottom edge. It also seems like the Nexus 6P may have slightly smaller bezels, but the difference is hardly noticeable. The 6P and the Pixel XL feature an AMOLED display with the same Quad HD resolution — 2,560 x 1,440 pixels. The 6P has a slightly larger display at 5.7 inches, as opposed to the 5.5-inch screen on the Pixel XL. You won’t notice much of a difference here, but we’ll have wait until we can review the Pixel XL for final judgment. Related: What smart home devices will work with Google Home when it debuts November 4? Both devices should have similar durability ratings thanks to the use of Gorilla Glass 4 — be aware  that there’s potentially more glass to crack on the back of the Pixel than on the 6P if you drop it. And they’re not water resistant, so don’t expect to take them swimming. In addition silver and black variants, the Nexus 6P comes in two more colors — gold and white. The Pixel has a black and silver option, but it also offers a unique “really blue” variant. It’s not often you see a blue phone, so a point goes to the Pixel. It’s a tough call, but we think the Pixel’s glass back looks better than the glass visor on the 6P. Winner: Pixel XL Battery Both smartphones have the exact same battery size, but Google claims the Pixel XL has longer battery life thanks to better control over hardware and software. The Nexus 6P has a standby time up to around 18 days, whereas the Pixel XL can go on standby for 23 days. Read More Internet use time for the Nexus 6P is around 10 hours on Wi-Fi, and 10 hours on LTE. For the Pixel XL, you can add 4 more hours on both Wi-Fi and LTE. Winner: Pixel XL Camera One highlight Google is pushing for the Pixel smartphones is the camera — it has received the highest score on DXOMark for a smartphone camera. The experience was built from the ground up, with a proprietary gyro-based stabilization software for video, improved HDR+ that processes incredibly fast, and one of the fastest capture times Google has clocked in its various tests. We tested the camera at the San Francisco event and it snapped pictures in succession at much faster speeds than the 6P. The Pixel also had a faster HDR+ processing speed. Google is also offering several Pro features in the camera, such as white balance presets, exposure compensation, automatic exposure and automatic focus locking, and viewfinder grid modes. Related: Google Pixel vs. Apple iPhone 7: Can new Google phone take down its enemy? Pixel owners also get free unlimited photo storage in Google Photos at full resolution. This is already an option in Google Photos, but storing at full resolution will eat up Google account storage space for non-Pixel owners. Both phones have the same megapixel count on both the front and rear cameras, but megapixels aren’t as much of a factor as software optimization. If anything, the unlimited, full resolution photo storage feature alone makes it a no-brainer to opt for the Pixel camera, rather than the Nexus 6P’s camera. Winner: Pixel XL Software The Pixel smartphones come equipped with the latest version of Android: 7.1 Nougat. The Nexus 6P is running Android 7.0 Nougat and will receive the beta version of 7.1 in November, when the Pixels launch. But that doesn’t mean the Nexus 6P is going to have the same software as the Pixel. There are several Pixel-exclusive features, notably Google Assistant. Press and hold the home button, and you’ll find Google Assistant come up, asking what you need help with. The Assistant can run search queries, order an Uber, and more. The feature may end up on Nexus phones as Google is “exploring” ways to implement it, but it’s unlikely it will come any time soon. Smart Storage, which automatically removes backed up photos from your device, and the Pixel Launcher are only on the Pixel. You also get 24/7 support built into the phone, complete with screen sharing in case you ever run into an issue. Related: What you need to know about Google’s Pixel software, and what’s in Android 7.1 Nougat Notably, there are a few features coming to other Android phones in 7.1: Night Light, a night mode; Launcher Shortcuts, similar to iOS’ 3D Touch; improved touch latency; fingerprint gestures that allow you to swipe down to bring down the notification drawer and more; Daydream VR support, and other seamless updates. You can read more about the differences between Android 7.1 Nougat in the Pixel and other Android devices here, but it’s always going to be a surefire win for the Pixel line. Winner: Pixel XL Pricing and availability Google is aiming for the big guns with its Pixel line — Samsung and Apple. Its devices are priced accordingly as well. The base 32GB Pixel XL costs $769 and the 128GB model costs $869. At the time of launch, the Nexus 6P was $500 for the 32GB model — markedly cheaper. Still, Google offers device financing from the Google Store, where you can pay off the phone in monthly payments over the course of 24 months. This was not available for the Nexus 6P, which is no longer for sale on the Google Store. You can pre-order the Pixel XL from the Google Store unlocked, and Verizon and Best Buy are selling the device as well.  The Nexus 6P is still available from third-party retailers like Amazon. Winner: Nexus 6P Overall winner: Pixel XL Sure, the Pixel XL’s price is quite a jump from the Nexus 6P, but strong software and hardware integration alone may be enough to warrant it. You’re getting the very best of Android, fast updates, 24/7 support, a much improved camera and internal specs, as well as unlimited, full resolution photo storage from Google Photos. You’re also getting a better battery life, though we’ll have to test Google’s claim once we get a review unit. Related: Friends? Not anymore. Google wants you to bow down and meet your master You should buy the Pixel XL if you’re deciding between the two, but if you’re thinking about upgrading, that’s a different question. You won’t see a huge increase in performance (except for the camera, maybe), but it depends if you want access to Assistant. You can still use Assistant via Google Allo, a messaging app, or by purchasing a Google Home. There is speculation that Google is looking to manufacture its own chips for its future products so that it won’t have to rely on HTC or other manufacturers. If that’s true, we may see even tighter software and hardware integration, and something truly special for Android in the next year or so. You can always hold out until then, but don’t expect the price to drop. Google’s aiming for the high-end market for sure, as Rick Osterloh, head of the hardware department at Google, says as in his interview with Recode.

It is part of the job. By Matt McCue Images courtesy of Sam Stubblefield 0 8 Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Amid a corporate arms race to attract talent, companies are building some pretty tricked-out offices these days. NBBJ architect Sam Stubblefield knows this well. He has helped design the headquarters for Google and Amazon. But as companies have added more OMG! amenities to their campuses, Stubblefield has developed into a bit of a contrarian. When someone asks him what is the next cool thing they can do to expand their office footprint, Stubblefield replies with, What is the last thing you can do to avoid building? “It’s so hard to go to Google and say, ‘You’ve got all of this land, but I wouldn’t build a building. I’d turn it into a nature preserve,” says Stubblefield. His recommendation to sprawling companies is to figure out how to get people working in shifts and largely from home. “That is basically talking our company out of projects, but, if that is the right choice, you have to do that,” he says.  The Seattle-based Stubblefield’s antithetical way of thinking extends to other topics as well, whether it’s establishing a killer design team with people from outside the field, turning city streets into public parks, or taking months off every year to focus on making art. We recently spoke with him about the need for creatives to look at the world from a different perspective than most. When you’re conceptualizing a building, where does your creative process begin? It goes way beyond architecture. I’m interested in how employees feel when they turn off their alarm clock every morning. What sort of head space are they in? What headspace are they in on their commute to work? I want to know what their entire day is like, every detail of it. How they feel when they walk out of their office building? Everything they associate with it. We need to think at that level. If we relegate it to space, I think we will be disappointed. Stubblefield had a hand in designing Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle. Your design teams are typically composed of people from diverse backgrounds, not just superstar architects. Why? We have a lot of doctors and nurses on staff here at NBBJ and it dramatically impacts our work. I love the idea of walking into a room where I have a badass technical architect, a nurse, and me and my background in fine art, and we’re going to go tackle an urban design problem for a civic project. You get outcomes that will be really different than if you had three people who studied similar architecture and graduated from similar schools. You have little or no chance of getting something really wild out of that group. It will get done, probably faster, probably easier, but it’s rare that you get something that is phenomenally different. If you have three people who studied similar architecture and graduated from similar schools, you have little chance of getting something wild out of that group. How does this approach impact how you hire? When we hire, we are looking for people who have two deep practices. Deep is admittedly a subjective term, but we think of it like Pi – have two good legs to stand on. For example, a former student of mine got a degree in both music and architecture at UC Berkeley, and then she decided to create music/sounds specifically for places. She has two deep practices, but she also has a squiggle across the top – the wavy symbol which says to me that that person can figure it out because they’re entrepreneurial, creative, and not too rigid. You can put any of those people against a problem, and you’ll often get a useful solution out of it.  If you don’t currently want to create buildings, where do you see the biggest opportunity for new work?  The biggest influencer to architecture right now will be human transportation. If you start to do the math, self-driving cars are going to happen. As we’re seeing people migrate to the cities, self-driving cars can reshape streets as we know them. What if pushing cars off the road gave our cities 20 percent of their streets back? How does that reshape a city? What if we turned it all into green space for a public park? It can be just trees. I walk around everywhere and my favorite thing to do is think, What if that was a strip of forest? It’s a fun thing to imagine. As we’re seeing people migrate to the cities, self-driving cars can reshape streets as we know them. Encouraging companies to use potential building space for green space and rethinking city streets as parks – how does it help a creative to look at the world from a different perspective? A creative cannot but look at the world differently. It is part of the job. But it is more than naturally having a different point of view. I think it is about actively searching for other ways, combining ideas, trying challenging approaches, generating visions, and finding other curious people to play with. I am fairly sure that it is a little bit of “bored kid” syndrome, too. The Seattle City Light, the world’s best-looking electrical substation. Tell us about your yearly work cycle, where you take several months off to make art.  I started taking a few months off every year because I had stuff that I wanted to do, but found that paying projects got in the way of more pure ideas. Nothing clever! It stayed fairly relaxed until a friend turned me onto Situationist International, a small group of artists and thinkers from Europe that emerged in the late 1950’s. This got me a little more serious about breaking patterns in work-life. The Situationists are a little extreme for my taste, but there is certainly something to learn. Alongside politics and economics, they get into architecture, film, wayfinding, graphic design, and urban design. I admire their ability to be influential without having any apparent linearity or framework. It encourages me to take time to explore the intersection of some of the things that I’m interested in, which requires time. A creative cannot but look at the world differently. It is part of the job. How do you make it work financially? The time is specifically set aside to do things that don’t need to make money, yet it is often my most productive (and sometimes most profitable) time of the year. It is normally spent planning, learning, teaching, and making. As the studio grows, it is becoming difficult to find the time. I’m just coming off a six-month artist residency here in Seattle. I was hoping to work two to three days per week in the studio, then be at the residency for the rest of the week. It ended up being five to six studio days and five to six residency days. It was 80-hour weeks for six months. Total disaster in terms of taking time to focus, but insanely productive. I know a lot more about robotics now. Really looking forward to finding more applications for that! As for how, I live fairly minimally, don’t own a car, and manage to keep things to a minimum. In lieu of higher education I decided to get some  great mentors and supplement that with the occasional class, so no school debt and an additional few years of earning. I’ve never had a credit card! Most of my money goes to travel and art projects. I don’t skimp on food. Good food is important. Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Close The Best Creative Career Insights, Delivered Weekly.

It appears that Google is actively removing the feature — I’m currently no longer seeing it on my Galaxy S7 edge — from the latest versions of the Google app… Holding down a combination (it varies by manufacturer) of the home, volume, and power buttons on most Android phones will capture a screenshot, but if you weren’t aware, Now on Tap added the ability to capture screenshots as well at some point last year. Holding the home button for Now on Tap and jumping straight to a share sheet was — in experience — the best part of the feature. But now it’s gone for many, I’m sad to report. I had it on an older version of the Google app on my Galaxy S7 edge, and it disappeared after I updated. Frankly, I don’t use Now on Tap very often, and I’m pretty glad that Google wisely decided to put the Assistant in its place on the Pixel phones (yes, I’m aware that the Now on Tap features are still there). But for those of us that are annoyingly without Assistant for a while (*cough* Nexus 6P users * cough*), it’s pretty odd that Google would remove this functionality. But I guess it is Google we’re talking about. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

Google announced one of the biggest typography projects, Noto, on Thursday. The font family covers more than 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. By Zhai Yun Tan, Staff October 8, 2016 Save for later Saved About video ads Google launches Noto, a family of fonts that covers over 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. View Caption About video ads View Caption of When your computer doesn’t recognize a language, a blank box is displayed on the screen – commonly known as a tofu. Seeing a tofu constantly is frustrating for those who find that they cannot share texts in their original scripts. Ali Eteraz, a Pakistani-American writer, wrote in a Medium post in 2013 about how nastaliq, a script from Urdu, which is a language spoken in Pakistan and India, is not supported in digital devices, so Urdu speakers must resort to pasting images of words to share texts, using other scripts, or simply writing with Western letters. “Constantly uploading image files to communicate maybe romantic (or it can make you feel like a second class digital citizen), but it is not practical,” he wrote. Recommended: Five times Internet activism made a difference On Thursday, Google announced their solution for the problem: Noto, named literally for “no more tofu,” a font family that covers more than 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. The project, five years in the making, is one of the biggest typography projects in recent times. It will be open source and free for download. Five times Internet activism made a difference Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend “Our goal for Noto has been to create fonts for our devices, but we’re also very interested in keeping information alive,” Bob Jung, director of internationalization for Google said in a press release. “When it comes to some of these lesser used languages, or even the purely academic or dead languages, we think it’s really important to preserve them. Without the digital capability of Noto, it’s much more difficult to preserve that cultural resource.” Noto, a product of collaboration between Google and font company Monotype, aims to “enable global communications across borders, languages, cultures and time periods,” as stated in the press release. While some may be wary of Google’s motives – the project arguably plays right into the giant company’s ambitions for global expansion – the goal is fitting to a time when more people than ever are using the Internet. For global minorities to be welcomed to the Internet with a familiar language can be vital in encouraging accessibility. “I’m hugely excited about this because Noto is massive and it’s really an amazing public service,” Finn Bunton, assistant professor at New York University, tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview. “Companies have incentives for doing this, but this is a pretty amazing thing to be done by Google.” Professor Bunton says Noto is monumental because until now, text has been transmitted and displayed in screens only through limited codes, which means some fonts don't even offer accented characters. Since the 1990s, the Unicode Consortium, a nonprofit that sets standard code points for symbols, characters, and even emojis on the Internet, has worked to create unique identifiers for every glyph in written languages. “But that didn’t mean you would be able to translate that into something that you could rely on to look good, be readable and work appropriately across a huge variety of platforms,” Bunton explains. “This is what Noto has done which is so amazing.… They’ve made a consistent library where all the pieces are going to be visually harmonious and easy to read.” Figuring out the unique codes for different languages can be tough. As reported by NPR in 2014, Unicode ran into trouble when they  clumped Chinese, Japanese and Korean into one character set. “You’d get this mishmash of fonts,” Jung told WIRED in an interview. “That was always the complaint we got – fonts just don’t look good when you mix languages.” Monotype and Google worked with reviewers who are native readers of the language or experts in typography to refine the product, including a Buddhist monastery who critiqued the font and made adjustments for the Tibetan script. For some languages, this may be the first time the script has a digital presence, let alone a dedicated display font. "That in particular is something that many different language communities could not afford to do on their own,” Monotype linguistic typographer Kamal Mansour said in the press release. “Google has been the benefactor in funding this work, and in many cases, we’ve produced the first font ever to serve a particular language community. So to me, the aim is to serve that human community that would otherwise be deprived of the ability to have a digital heritage.” Next up Five times Internet activism made a difference How Saul Bass changed design Verbal energy: Going geeky over type fonts Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads Monitor's Best: Top 5 How Americans are handling post-election hate GOP-controlled Congress will still need Democrats Cover Story Why climate change divides us Minority women make big strides on Election Day The president is commander in chief?

Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's October 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleve, a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

But all that is just a bunch of bluster if we can’t see actual results. Soon after Google’s event this week, Phandroid posted over 100 images taken with the search giant’s new Pixel devices. You can see all of them in the gallery above. The Pixel comes with a 12.3-megapixel camera featuring an f/2.0 aperture and 1.55 micron pixels. “Our team of photography gurus and image processing experts have spent the last year designing and tirelessly optimizing our entire camera stack,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai. “Pixel’s camera lets you take stunning photos in low light, bright light or any light,” Pichai added. “Catch action shots as they happen with Smartburst, which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots and automatically selects the best one. Use Lens Blur to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, making your subject pop. Google’s Pixel also offers manual settings, giving users more control over exposure, white balance, and more. All of this adds up to the best smartphone camera Google has ever made. The images above certainly look impressive but as Phandroid notes a lot of them have been edited using Snapseed and VSCO Cam. We’ll get a better idea of what the pictures straight out of the Pixel when we get our hands on a retail unit later this month.

The creation of interactions will be done through the recently announced Actions on Google.  Google Assistant is an AI offering much like Amazon's Alexa. This makes Actions on Google the platform's version of Amazon's Skills.  Upon the opening of the Actions on Google program, developers will have access to Assistant's SDK. Developers will be able to create two types of requests: direct actions and conversational actions. Direct actions are suited for transactional requests such as home automation or requesting of media. Conversations on the other hand, are for tasks that require more of a back and forth interaction. Requesting an Uber, providing your destination and specifying which type of car you need would be an example. These interactions are powered by API.ai which Google acquired last month. Google Assistant is already featured in the Allo chat app and Google Home. With the opening of the platform developers will be able to integrate it into their own services and devices. Bots already built with API.ai will also be available to integrate into Assistant. It's worth noting however, that Assistant is currently only available for Pixel phones. A Google spokesperson confirmed this to TechCrunch stating, "Our goal is to make the Google Assistant widely available to users, and we’ll continue to launch new surfaces over the course of the next year." Google has already lined up a number of parnters for the Actions on Google launch. These include Spotify and CNN for media, Uber for ride sharing, OpenTable for restaurant reservations and more.

Updated Hot Tags NASA Climate Change Earth Moon Alien Experience us with dark theme sciencewr.com Home Space Nature & Environment Health & Medicine Tech Physics Human Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Advertisement Interbrand Top 100 Global Brands: Apple, Google and Coca-Cola Stay On Top, Tesla and Dior Gets Included Pat M First Posted: Oct 08, 2016 05:30 AM EDT SAN FRANCISCO, CA - AUGUST 10: The Tesla logo is displayed inside of the new Tesla flagship facility on August 10, 2016 in San Francisco, California. Tesla is opening a 65,000 square foot store, its largest retail center to date. The facility will offer sales and service of Tesla's electric car line. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Photo : Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Interbrand just released this year's Top 100 global brands, and Apple, Google, and Coca-Cola take this year's Top 3 spots again.  Newbies who entered the Top 100 are Tesla and fashion empire Dior. This list is based on consumer influence and brand presence. Advertisement Apple and Google have consistently been the top two global brands for the past four years, and they are still growing. Both companies respectively have seen a 5% and 11% percent growth respectively in the past year. The brand consultancy agency has been curating this list for the past 17 years, and CEO Jez Frampton says that based on the topnotchers on the list, it can be told that "the best global brands are not just weathering change, but driving it, They understand their Anatomy of Growth is complex, unique and personal; they look inward and outward, expand into new markets, and create better experiences to grow their brands and businesses." Tesla is a welcome addition in the respected list of the Top 100 global brands. They have proven that it's possible to grow into a super company from scratch. Especially in the auto industry, that's pretty much an impossible feat. With Elon Musk's lead, Tesla is now one of the leading brands in its sector. There are qualifications for companies to take a coveted spot on the list. According to their official website, a company must be operating in three major continents and they must have a roadmap in emerging markets. Thirty percent of the revenue must come from other countries, and fifty percent of it shouldn't come from just one continent. The Interbrand way of determining who makes the list is ISO certified as well. The qualifications are pretty strict, which makes being part of the list an even bigger privilege. Will Apple and Google still reign supreme on next year's list? With many industries going up and down, it's anybody's guess who'll be the next game changers.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google will open NY pop-up store for Pixel phone & other hardware Adam Westlake - Oct 8, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Now that Google has announced a pair of new smartphones and other additional hardware, it’s opening a similarly branded “Made by Google” physical retail location. The company has revealed it will open a pop-up store on 96 Spring Street in Manhattan, New York on October 20th, offering customers the chance to check out the hardware announced earlier this week, including the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, the Google Home smart speaker, and the Google WiFi. The store listing was found on the new Made by Google website. Since it’s a ‘pop-up,’ it’s likely the location won’t be a permanent retail fixture, however there’s no details on how long it will remain open or if it will move to other cities. As the web and software giant is making a serious move into the hardware market, it makes sense for Google to have a physical retail presence. It’s a move that has been used to great success by Apple, which now has hundreds of permanent stores, and even more recently by Amazon, which has plans to open pop-ups in shopping malls to highlight its Echo and Kindle devices. This isn’t Google’s first experiment with retail stores, however. When the company was trying to launch its ill-fated Google Glass as the next big, trend-setting wearable device, it opened a handful of physical showrooms in cities like San Francisco, London, New York City, and Los Angeles.

Tech giants are hungry for artificial intelligence. In a race to create the best AI solutions in an increasingly hot sector, U.S. tech behemoths like Alphabet's Google and iPhone maker Apple have been quietly snapping up dozens of artificial intelligence companies over the last five years, according to a recent report from analysis firm CB Insights. The firm's data sheds new light on a trend that's been evolving for years. Nearly 140 private companies working to advance AI technology have been acquired since 2011, including 40 buyouts just this year, CB noted. From Google's Assistant to Apple's Siri; Microsoft's Cortana to Facebook chatbots, tech companies appear to be locked in a fierce competition to create autonomous technology that can understand users' needs, and provide information quickly and reliably, CB Insights noted. In addition, companies like AOL, IBM and Yahoo were also among the acquirers, CB said. The report comes as Silicon Valley makes increasingly aggressive inroads into AI, and last week, Microsoft created an artificial intelligence unit of its own. It's a hot market that research firm Tractica estimates will balloon from $643.7 million in 2016 revenues to $38.8 billion by 2025. show chapters <p>Samsung buys AI firm to take on Apple and Google</p> <p>The purchase will help the tech firm compete with Siri and Alexa in the world of artificial intelligence.</p> Samsung buys AI firm to take on Apple and Google    Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 9:00 AM ET | 04:50 Google has been the most prominent global player, CB noted, with 11 low-key acquisitions in the category. Most recently, the tech giant picked up Api.ai, a platfom used to develop chatbots. Earlier this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company objective was to give each individual user their own Google. And last week, Google unveiled a high-end smartphone, Pixel, and home device installed with its AI software. Google said it believes that the next opportunity is building hardware and software together for better AI. The strategic move pitted the company against Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Corporate giants following closely in purchasing AI companies include Intel and Apple. Apple, which is usually quite about its acquisitions and planning, acquired Turi and Tuplejump recently, according to CB Insights. Earlier this year, Apple acquired an start-up called Emotient which has developed technology that can detect emotions. Not to be outdone, Samsung snapped up startup Viv Labs, amid a growing controversy over reports that its premium Galaxy Note 7 battery was exploding.

Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming introduction and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc.Direct competition Google’s introduction of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign”. He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who spoke on anonymity. Verizon investment Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s October 20 introduction through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel.Creative ads But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said noting the white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone.

I can’t imagine the number of times his preschool teachers’ eyes rolled when he talked about Google as if she was a close friend of his who answers all his questions and plays his favorite music. But without getting ahead of ourselves, you’ll see hear the boy turn on the living room lights at first, then launch into a series of “Okay Googeeelll” questions with the super precise enunciation that you expect of a 4-year-old (read: nah).

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Software Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Internet News / Google's closing its photo sharing service Panoramio on November 4 Google's closing its photo sharing service Panoramio on November 4 by Ben Woods 08 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Google is finally closing down its photo sharing service Panoramio, much to the distress of the platform's few remaining loyal users. You probably haven't heard a whole lot about the location-based photo service in the past few years, and that's because this is actually the second time that Google's tried to close down the platform, after ultimately relenting following a user petition in 2014. Now, this time the company really means it and no amount of protest is going to stop the service closing. That means you'll need to make sure your account is linked to your Google+ account if you the photos you've uploaded over the years copued across to a Google archive for downloading. "If you have linked your Panoramio profile with a Google account, all your Panoramio photos will be copied to the Google Album Archive at full resolution after Panoramio goes away. These copied photos will not use any of your Google storage quota. Your Panoramio photos that appear in Google Maps will continue to appear in Maps, unless you delete them later from the Maps Contributions panel," Google advises users. From Google's perspective, it makes a lot of sense as it has newer features attached to Google Maps that do a similar, if not the same, job. Specifically, the Local Guides option, which lets people upload photos, reviews and other information about a location. From the perspective of long-time users that spent years contributing to Panoramio, uploading images, levelling up their accounts and generally building a community, it feels more like a metaphorical kick in the teeth. While there's a substitute in the form of Local Guides, and Panoramio had a good run since its launch in 2005, it's unlikely that the platform's holdouts will make the jump to Google Maps due to a slightly different feature set and less of a community focus.

Pocket-lint Sections App Camera Car Drone Fitness Tracker Gadgets Games Headphone Laptop Parenting Phone Smart Home Smartwatch Speaker Tablet TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Polar M600 review: Top-notch smartwatch and fitness tracker fusion Chris Hall8 October 2016Smartwatch Pocket-lint 4.5 stars - Pocket-lint recommended £269 For Solid design, sports takes priority over smartwatch, all of Android Wear's functions, Polar Flow does so much, respectable battery performance for a smartwatch, IPX8 waterproofing Against Design could be more exciting, swimming could be better served, heart rate can be a little erratic, price Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment The explosion of smartwatches and fitness trackers has thrown up some real gems and thrown down some real turds, leaving us all to step carefully when choosing a new device. Polar is an established name in fitness devices, one of the oldest, perhaps, when dealing with heart rate monitoring. A widening portfolio from Polar has seen the birth of more lifestyle devices in the A family and stepping up in functions across the M (sport) and V (pro) devices, with a gradual increase in wider connectivity across the brand's offerings. The M600 is a rethinking, adopting a proper smartwatch platform and offering those fitness tracker functions the company is known for combined with a lot more on the watch side than you'd normally get. The result is one of the most considered sports devices we've seen and certainly one of the best Android Wear devices to date. Pocket-lint Polar M600 review: Design and build The Polar M600 mates the body module with a rubber strap and, like the TomTom Spark, the body slots into the strap meaning the two sections can be easily separated when you want to clean them. The design looks a lot like previous Polar watches, although it's pretty thick, meaning you need enough wrist for it to sit on. If you're of the thin forearm variety you might think it's too big, but we found it sat well on an average male arm. The chunkiness gives it some substance and it looks good, both from a sports point of view and as a smartwatch. Compared to other Android Wear devices, Polar's watch-making experience is apparent, as this is much nicer than something like the Moto 360 Sport and looks better and wears better than that previous attempt. As with other Polar devices the screen is square fitting Polar's family design. Pocket-lint On to the more serious stuff. There's proper waterproofing with an IPX8 rating so it supports swimming, the screen is protected with Gorilla Glass to avoid scratches and the metal detailing that frames the display left and right gives a premium look. There's the choice of black or white, although we'd like to see a choice of strap colours to give the design wider appeal. The rubber strap is easy to adjust and uses a conventional two pronged buckle, with two bands to stop the spare strap catching on things. Most importantly, the M600 is comfortable to wear and sweat through, and weighing 65g, it's not too heavy either. Polar M600 review: Sports features first Designed as a sports watch first, there are two buttons. The first button to the left side is the standard Android Wear button, letting you go home, wake the display or long press to access the menu. The second button on the front takes you straight to the sports side, opening the Polar app. This is very much sports territory and we really like that Polar hasn't been distracted by Android Wear: it's taken the platform and owned it, rather than skipping around Google's fancy smartwatch features. Pocket-lint The hardware tells a similar story. With an optical heart rate sensor onboard and its own GPS you're ready to run out the door and leave your smartphone at home. There is no compass or barometer, however, so direction and elevation is based on GPS. There's also support for accessories, so if you have an H7 Polar chest strap, you'll get the option of using that, which might be the preferred option for cyclists. One of the skills that Polar does adopt from Android Wear is the support for Bluetooth headphones and local storage for your music, meaning you can take your music with you on the run, again without your phone. TomTom Spark 3 offers this, as does Apple Watch 2, and it's a feature that is sure to be popular. The great thing is that this full feature set, supported by this hardware, makes for a great fitness device, before you even touch the smartwatch side of things.  Polar M600 review: Hardware specs and display The Polar M600 is powered by a MediaTek chipset with 512MB RAM and a standard 4GB of storage. The battery is 500mAh which is pretty good for this type of device and explains the thickness. Pocket-lint There's a 1.3-inch display on the front with a 240 x 240 pixel resolution. This isn't the largest or sharpest Android Wear watch display, but as we said, the screen fits and we found it a good size for reading on the move. It supports always on functions, dimming in normal wear and brightening up when you move the watch to look at. As an LCD this is a backlit full colour display so it's illuminated, rather than using the lower power displays that some other sports watches offer. It looks great, which adds to the appeal, but does draw more heavily on the battery than the mono TomTom or Garmin displays, for example. It does have an ambient light sensor, however, so adjusts to the lighting conditions around you. Polar M600 review: Battery life and charging The 500mAh battery will give you about 2 days of use when connected to an Android device, including exercise time. You might be able to push it to a little more in casual wear. We've not tested the Polar M600 with an iPhone, but reports suggest this drops to about a day with Apple's phone. In reality, the Android Wear experience is much enhanced when paired with an Android phone and at least you have the option, unlike the Apple Watch. Pocket-lint Two days is good for Android Wear devices, but it does mean regular charging compared to many other sports watches which will often give you perhaps 5 active days or more - but without really offering any smart functions. That's the trade-off here: the Polar M600 doesn't have great endurance in sporting terms, but it offers a whole lot more in terms of functionality, meaning it does a lot more than just tell you the time when you're walking around.  Charging is via the magnetic connection point on the rear and over the past weeks that we've been using the M600, we've typically opted to charge every other day without it running flat. The charger neatly attaches to the rear of the watch without needing to clip anything on or fiddle around. Polar M600 review: Setup and connections To get the M600 up and running you need two things: the Android Wear app and the Polar Flow app on your phone. The first handles the connection to your phone, the second syncs with your Polar account and syncs the data from your watch. Using Android Wear on an Android smartphone makes for a fast and easy connection as the devices are designed for seamless cooperation. Once you're connected, you can use the Android Wear app to control many of the smartwatch functions, like deciding what notifications you want from your M600 and so on. Pocket-lint The Android Wear app will also then sync your apps, so anything you have on your device that's compatible with Wear will then move over - like Spotify, Play Music, Citymapper and even other fitness apps if you want to use them.  The Polar Flow app then handles everything else. This is where you'll view your stats and be able to get a good look at your activities you record using the M600. We like the Polar Flow app. It's very much a lifestyle app on your phone, firstly delivering a report on your daily activities, but it lets you dive into your runs, check out your heart rate and pace from an activity as well as your route and other essential details.  Taking things further, the Polar Flow app has a calendar in it too where you can schedule workouts, meaning you can tap the watch and dive into the workout that you've planned. If you're training against a plan, it means you've got the information on your wrist, ready to get going. You can setup intervals, distance or time targets. You can also sync Polar training results and targets into your Google Calendar if you want and share the data with a couple of other services - Strava and Training Peaks. Pocket-lint Information is synced from the app to the web version of Polar Flow which includes a few more options and has more in-depth information. However, you don't have to use the browser at all during setup: you can connect the Polar M600 to your phone and do everything there, without having to use a PC. There are a couple of bespoke Polar watch faces that will show you daily activity, so you can see where you are with your target at a glance, which help boost the fitness tracker side of the M600. Polar M600 review: 24/7 activity monitoring Before we get to actual sports tracking, the M600 wants to monitor what you're doing all the time. We mentioned that the Polar Flow has a lifestyle approach and this is has, breaking down your day into sleep, resting, sitting, low, medium or high activity. With this in mind, you're presented with your progress through your day on the watch face. One of the elements of this is steps, which we feel is a little too enthusiastic about awarding you a "step". It's a hard thing to measure, as when we measured physical steps, the results seemed accurate enough, but in an average day in the office, we seemed to accrue many more steps through other movements. Compared to Fitbit tracking, for example, it's a lot easier to hit your step target with the M600, suggesting that it's a lot more sensitive to movement than it perhaps should be. Steps isn't really an absolute measure, however, so if it's steps you're interested in, this probably isn't the device for you. If you're inactive for too long you'll get inactivity alerts and these aren't just reminders to move, they get logged in Polar Flow, so you'll feel the enduring shame. If that's not a motivator, we don't know what is. One of the nice aspects of Polar Flow is that it reports on your day, week and month assessing your activity and telling you what difference that has made to your life. Polar M600 review: Running and sports functions Press that button on the front and the Polar app opens on the M600. There are two sections, one to check your daily activity in more detail and the second to start recording a sport. Polar gives you freedom to choose your sport profiles to suit the activities. For many this will be running, cycling or swimming, but there's a full range of sports to choose from, like badminton, dance, football or plain old walking, for example. That's great, because you don't have to compromise on categorising your activity. Want to record your dog walking? No problem. Want to record your Friday rowing session? No problem. Pocket-lint For outdoor sports you have GPS tracking, so there are different profiles for pool and open water swimming for example, which we really like and you only have to have the sports on your watch that you actually need. Don't want "other outdoor"? You can remove it. Head into the Polar Flow website and you get to customise your sports profiles further, changing the information you see on your watch, which it really clever. Once you've selected your activity, the watch sensors fire up, looking for GPS and turning on the optical heart rate sensor on the rear. You can start the activity immediately, or wait for those things sensors to lock on, but again, with time being precious, it's sometimes good to get going without having to wait. We've found the GPS to lock on quickly, however, so there's never really been too much of a delay in getting started.  During your sport, you're presented with a number of screens with relevant information, based on the activity you're doing. For running you get a main screen that's similar to Polar's other devices, like the V800. The M600 has the advantage of colour, so as you move through different heart rate zones, the colour of the HR readout will change too, for at-a-glance information. There's also clear indiction of pace and distance when running. Swimming isn't as well served as it could be, with pool swimming lacking the option to detect lengths automatically like the Apple Watch 2 does. That leaves you with heart rate tracking and time, which is good enough. We also found that the flow of the water was able to swipe through screens, so we'd often stop a set in the pool with something different on the display. Pocket-lint With Android Wear automatically dimming the display, Polar has added the option to have the display always on. This means you can glance and see the stats without having to touch and avoids the problem of not being able to view the screen without an over exaggerated gesture. That will eat more battery, but if you're busting a gut trying to beat your 10k PB run, you won't care, you'll just need to keep an easy eye on your pace. If there was one thing we'd want to boost the watch's sporting credentials, it's another button. We'd love a start/stop button, rather than having to use the display, but that's a minor thing. There's also no automatic detection for your activities, but sitting closer to a serious running watch we think that's fine: it will differentiate between activity levels in the daily tracking anyway, so there's no harm in selecting the sport you're doing for detailed tracking. One of the great things is that the Polar Flow website provides a lot more information than you'll find on other platforms. It will give you an overview of your running progress, it will estimate how much fatigue you might be carrying over from earlier workouts as a guide to whether you're over or under training. You can also sign-up to training programmes, meaning there's a lot on offer, beyond your actual running stats. Polar M600 review: GPS and heart rate performance There's a wide degree of variation in performance with the latest crop of sports gadgets, something that's seen widespread reporting about accuracy. The Polar M600 performs well in tracking via GPS, with some really accurate route tracking and good distance recording. Polar has put six LEDs in the optical heart rate sensor on the back of the M600, aiming to ensure it's as accurate as it can be. Naturally, using the optional chest strap will give better results, but wrist measurement is all about convenience. The M600 performs fairly well, but we have seen some inconsistent HR results at times. Pocket-lint We've seen a fairly slow start at times, with the first 10 minutes or so seeing a slow build-up of heart rate, not quite reflecting the real rate increase. We've also had some runs where the watch would occasionally show a blank result, as though it wasn't recording, but it was. On checking the results afterwards, there's no sign of drop-out.  To verify what was happening, we tested it against a Garmin Forerunner 610 with chest strap. The Garmin was faster to respond to rate changes, more accurately reflecting the build-up of heart rate at the start of the run, as well as responding faster to some sprint sections we threw in. However, at the end of the run, both showed an average of 152bpm and both showed the same distance covered and same average pace. So, although there are some anomalies with the results, that overall doesn't have a huge impact on the bigger picture of runs when using the Polar M600. Outside of running we've found it to deliver some good results and we're impressed it manages to offer a consistent result when swimming, for example.  Polar M600 review: A full Android Wear experience That's where most sports devices would reach the limit of their functionality, but sitting on the Android Wear platform, the Polar M600 offers a whole lot more. You get a full range of alerts and notifications and if you have an Android smartphone, this really is a first class offering, especially compared to the arrangement on some other sports devices. It's something that's offered by other Polar watches and some Garmin devices, but here you're supported by the Android community for your functionality, not just Polar. Pocket-lint We've mentioned apps and one of the aspects that the M600 gets from Android Wear is Bluetooth headphone and music support. You can connect any Bluetooth headphones you like, but music support is limited to Google's Play Music service and you have to download and sync that from your phone, which is a bit of a faff so it's worth only syncing music for running, but we love not having to carry that vintage iPod on the run.  Expanding out into other Android Wear highlights, you have Google Maps for navigation while you're connected to your phone, support for Ok Google voice controls, so you can speak replies to messages and so on. Then you have all the fun stuff, like being able to pause your Spotify music from your watch, controlling Netflix over your Chromecast, or getting Citymapper directions right on your wrist.  Although Android Wear has a bad rep from lacklustre early devices, the Polar M600 isn't one of them. This is a sports watch that benefits from a huge range of extra functions enabled by Android Wear, resulting in something fun and functional. In many ways, the Polar M600 is currently without compare. Verdict The Polar M600 is a fusion of smartwatch and sports device. It takes Android's platform and laces in sports and fitness tracking functions, but maintains a balance that some devices don't manage. It succeeds in being both where others have failed. It feels like a proper Polar sports watch, boosted by the best of Android Wear. For an Android smartphone user, this is a device that's worth serious consideration. If you've been put off by Android Wear so far, this is how to do Android Wear right. It's not about bland presentation, it's about underpinning something more exciting. In this case, it's a fully-featured activity watch, especially good for running, that barely feels like Android Wear at all. The Polar M600 is currently rather unique. It's not only an effective sports partner, it's a great smartwatch too.

Store bosses were able to identify the 30-year-old from the Google Street View stills. Although, as per Google policy, her face was blurred they were able to identify her from her distinctive white top she was wearing.  She wore the same outfit when she was arrested. 'I'm an ex-Teesside University student so I thought I would see my old stomping ground, and as soon as I spotted it I thought 'that seemed a bit strange,' said Peter Darby, an IT worker who came across the images.  'I moved further down the street and you could see a bloke pursuing her. By the end she was going full speed. Run! Store Bosses were able to identify her from her distinctive white top she was wearing for the robbery and when she was arrested. And she thought she got away with it. McIvor flees the store as caught on Google Street View with a worker in tow  'You could tell as soon as you looked at the pictures that something was up as she came out of there very angrily. 'She was running around with the Sports Direct bag and it was obvious she was up to no good.'  The images were filmed on June 19 in the town center at around 2.45pm.

Everything you need to know about Google's new Wi-Fi router The Daily Dot 10/8/2016 Amrita Khalid © Photo via Google Google Wifi If your Wi-Fi signal is slow or patchy in some areas of the house, Google may soon solve that problem.  Google previewed a slate of new products this week that includes Google Wi-Fi, a set of Wi-Fi points designed to be placed throughout your house. The concept is known as "mesh Wi-Fi." It uses multiple Wi-Fi points instead of the centralized router systems most of us are accustomed to. Google Wi-Fi points are expandable—you can buy as many as you need—and are designed to connect to each other.  Interestingly enough, Google only just released a Wi-Fi router last year, Google OnHub. According to Ars Technica, if you own a Google OnHub already, you don't need to pick one over the other. A Google OnHub router can be used as a node in your Google Wi-Fi network. © Provided by Daily Dot If you're a heavy gamer, love streaming video, or live in a house with people that fit those categories, mesh Wi-Fi is certainly an attractive prospect. Parents will no doubt love that Google Wi-Fi's app allows you to shut off the Wi-Fi during homework time or whenever else you choose.  But there are a couple of reasons that Google Wi-Fi may give you pause. Mesh networks have gotten a bad wrap in recent years for still being slow, spotty, and expensive. Mesh networks have traditionally been used in emergency and disaster scenarios.  Mesh networks are cheap to set up and require no centralized network for set-up. According to Wired, the only way to shut down a mesh network is to shut individually shut down every node in the network.

Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, the search engine’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa, in a statement on Saturday said that the application would be available on Google Play and the App Store. “Like most Nigerian parents, you love helping your kids learn new things about the world. For instance, you spend a lot of time with them on YouTube, watching videos that interest them. “You skip videos not meant for their age, just to explore the sing along songs on HooplaKidz, Sesame Street, history and science channels. The fun is catching, but your alertness is important! “With the newly introduced YouTube Kids App now available for download in Nigeria, your kids can enjoy more videos on every topic in the world; protected from adult-type content, while you do other things,” Kola-Ogunlade said. The Google manager said that the app, which had parental controls, would help the parent to control the kid’s experience, without meddling in their fun. “A parent can determine how much exploring their kids can do, by turning on the search or limit the child’s experience by turning it off. “The timer feature on YouTube Kids alerts your kids when time is up, by limiting screen time. “The sound settings allow you to turn off the sounds, so you can catch your breath while your kid watches in peace,” he said. According to him, the YouTube Kids App comes with a Pass Code, as there is ”no sneaking around watching when I am not there” and a logged-out experience. “The logged out experience enables one to enjoy the fun, no sign-in hassles, features like uploading, sharing, liking etc, linked to accounts have been removed,” Kola-Ogunlade said.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsGoogle Didn’t Hold Back on the iPhone 7’s Camera Performance (GOOG) Google Didn’t Hold Back on the iPhone 7’s Camera Performance (GOOG) Google-parent Alphabet Inc. says its flagship smartphone has the best camera ever made. October 8, 2016 Cristina Lee Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently launched its newest flagship smartphone, the Pixel alongside Pixel XL, and boy, did the Mountain View, Calif.-based company made some bold claims. According to Google exec Sundar Pichai, the Pixel has the single best phone camera ever made. And to erase all doubts that Google is coming after the iPhone 7, the event was filled with savage burns directed at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple is all about camera performance and it’s been one of the key features that’s consistently improving with every reiteration of the iPhone. To illustrate how deeply Apple cares about camera performance, execs say that over 800 engineers worked on the iPhone 7’s camera, piecing together over 200 components within the teeny tiny camera modules. And because of the improved hardware, the iPhone 7 featured a bump that most users are unhappy about. Google execs made not-so-subtle digs at the iPhone 7 camera bump during the launch. In a live demo, the bump has been mentioned one time too many, highlighting the fact that the Pixel does not have this much-maligned design. The execs added that Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC assembled the Pixel smartphones. Google also bragged about the Pixel’s camera performance, highlighting the fact that its newest smartphone scored 89 out of 100 in a DxOMark Mobile test. On the same test, the iPhone 7 scored an 86. DxOMark is known for rating cameras and lenses for smartphones and high-end DSLRs alike using sophisticated analysis software. However, it’s worth noting that DxOMark has yet to review iPhone 7 Plus’ camera. Google also slammed one of most common sources of frustration among iPhone users, the limited storage. As you know, photos and videos eat a lot of space and if you’re using an iOS device, then you might be familiar with the annoying storage full popups. According to Brian Rakowski, Google’s vice president of product management, Pixel and the Pixel XL users can kiss these “painful” Storage Full popups goodbuy because their flagship smartphones will come with “free unlimited storage for photos and videos at full resolution.” Moreover, both the regular and the XL Pixels share the same features, which means, Google is not putting a premium on extra/special features, something that’s been a tradition at Apple. To top it all off, the Pixel smartphones will be the first to feature Google’s newest digital assistant, the company’s answer to Apple’s Siri. Other notable Pixel camera features include the ability to edit photos. Google’s Pixel smartphone features a sleek, aluminum and glass form factor. The smaller, 5 inch model – priced at $649 – comes with a storage of 32 GB, while the larger XL, features a 5.5-inch screen with up to 128 GB storage, just like the iPhone 7 Plus. Both Pixels boasts of a high res display, 12 megapixel rear cameras, 8 mega pixel front cameras and the latest chipset by Qualcomm Snapdragon.

It seems unlikely, and here's why. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 8, 2016 at 9:22AM Image source: Google.  Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google recently announced its first in-house smartphones, known as the Pixel and the Pixel XL (a larger variant of the Pixel). These are premium devices, starting at $649 for the base Pixel model (5 inches) and $769 for the base Pixel XL model (5.5 inches). These phones currently use a Snapdragon 821 applications processor produced by wireless chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). However, according to Bloomberg, Google has expressed interest in building its own custom silicon out in time. This leads to a very interesting question: Will Google develop its own applications processors for future Pixel smartphones? Google could probably do it Putting together a reasonably competent smartphone-oriented applications processor these days isn't too difficult, especially if one has the money to spend (and Google can clearly afford it). Many of the key intellectual properties that go into a mobile processor -- CPU cores, graphics, memory controllers, eMMC, and so on -- can be licensed from third parties such as ARM Holdings, Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH: IGNMF), and Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS). One major hurdle that Google would undoubtedly face in trying to build its own custom chip is the fact that it could not easily license a cellular modem to integrate into such a chip. Google would either have to spend a lot of time, money, and effort to even hope to build a reasonably competitive cellular modem or it would need to use stand-alone modems from the likes of Qualcomm or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the two suppliers of modems into the latest iPhone.  The stand-alone solution is less than ideal because the current Pixel phone uses a chip that integrates the modem onto the same piece of silicon as the applications processor, which helps to reduce board size as well as power consumption. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been dealing with stand-alone modems for as long as the iPhone has been around, but for Google it would represent a step back from the solution that it's already using.  In order to build a differentiated solution, Google could choose to build unique intellectual properties to integrate alongside the core technologies licensed from the above vendors. Custom hardware to accelerate certain common smartphone functions (thereby improving performance and/or lowering power consumption), for example, could be worthwhile projects for a potential Google custom silicon team to pursue if it really wants to build its own chips. Would it be worthwhile? The impression that I get is that most of the companies that build their own applications processors don't actually produce differentiated (or, frankly, even worthwhile) solutions relative to what can be purchased from the likes of Qualcomm and MediaTek. Apple's in-house chip efforts have been quite successful, and Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been reasonable, but efforts from the likes of Huawei's HiSilicon and LG have been mostly underwhelming. If Google were a major smartphone vendor and its core revenue/profitability depended on selling large volumes of ultra-premium smartphones, then there might be a case to spend all of the time and effort to build in-house applications processors, though there's no guarantee that it'd be as good as, let alone better than, what Google could buy from Qualcomm. However, given that the Google Pixel is unlikely to be a particularly high volume seller, especially when it's charging premium prices, and given the fierce competition in the Android landscape from companies that have been at this longer than Google has been, I doubt that there's much of a (rational) business justification for such an effort. I'm not betting on it My guess is that Google will build a couple more generations of these Pixel devices, but they ultimately won't sell all that well. At that point, I expect the effort around the Pixel to be scaled back, if not outright shuttered. If the case for an in-house applications processor is tenuous at this point, I suspect that it'll seem downright silly if and when it becomes clear that the Pixel is a nice hobby, but not really a worthwhile product category for Google to pursue over the long haul.

We have compiled a list of beautiful looking, productivity yielding Calendar apps for Android users.  ( Tapir Apps | Google Store ) Advertisement Facebook recently launched its Events App for iOS, and users can plan their attendance to nearby events and sync with their friends to enjoy some quality time together. Events App also features a neat integration with Apple's proprietary Calendar app, making it easy to keep track of the conferences, concerts, and parties that users might want to attend. However, Facebook Events is only available on iOS at the moment, so users of Google's mobile OS might miss out. That is why we listed some of the best calendar apps for Android users. aCalendar (Free or $4.99 for full features) Ranking first on many reviewers' lists of calendars, aCalendar surely deserves its place at the top. The app features a solid assortment of features, such as many types of views, multiple widgets and more. To those who can get by with basic tools, it comes at zero additional cost. Productivity oriented users might want to fork out $4.99 for the full version, which comes with more control features and gesture controls. Users who downloaded aCalendar from Google Store gave it a 4.4/5, which is the highest mark on our list. CloudCal ($2.50 for full features) Android users get one of the most intuitive and easy-on-the-eyes ways of showing how busy they are on any given day. ClouldCal uses a system dubbed Magic Circles, which depicts days as clock faces, with each activity corresponding to a circle (or slice) of a different color. The app features a neat integration of customizable views, calendar import and gesture support, and it plays nice with apps such as Google Maps, Uber, and Waze. Keep in mind that in order to use the transportation apps you need to shell out $2.50 for the Pro version. Download CloudCal from Google Store, where it scores 4.3/5. Google Calendar (Free) Google's proprietary Calendar app delivers a clean, bright interface and a multitude of views: traditional month and week views alongside schedule-focused views. Integration with your Gmail account lets you automatically sap information about flights, hotel accommodation, and restaurant reservations from your emails and create events based on said info. You may also use it for reminders and to-do lists. Users may download Google Calendar from Google Store, where it ranks 4.1/5. DigiCal (Free) DigiCal is a versatile Android calendar that offers a myriad of view modes and widgets. Users can have an overview or a detailed breakdown of their schedule, thanks to the day, week, month or year-based view mode. The app plays nice with Exchange, Outlook and Google Calendar. What is more, DigiCal lets you know when to pack an umbrella thanks to its embedded weather forecast, and its invitation management and time zone features are quite useful, as well. Get DigiCal from Google Store, where it sits at 4.3/5. TAG Calendar app, Facebook Events App, Android Apps, Calendar, Google Calendar © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

If you did, you should go check it out. The post is Explore important insights from your data — automatically. I have access to a number of Google Analytics accounts, and I can say this about the suggestions shown in this new feature from Google Analytics – they are worth looking at and thinking about. A couple of the accounts I looked at offered 10 suggestions for changes. Some of these suggestions simply point out that some content on the site you are looking at saw increases in traffic recently, pointing out the URLS of that content. Frankly, that is what inspired me to write this post – it seemed to be a topic related to other posts on my site that had been drawing lots of traffic. If you haven’t been paying much attention to the analytics related to your website, it can be a helpful thing to do. I also recommend spending some time on the Website of Google’s Analytic’s evangelist Avinash Kaushic, reading articles such as The Biggest Mistake Web Analysts Make… And How To Avoid It! I like how he focuses upon business insights, which is something that most site owners want to see. Your analytics program can do more than just tell you how many people are visiting your website – it can offer you suggestions and ideas on how to improve you site and provide a better experience to visitors of your site. The automated assistant suggestions can provide some ideas for changes you can make from the data collected by your analytics program. The blog post tells us that Google Analytics will keep on offering new automated assistant suggestions over time, so it’s worth revisiting those and seeing if they update over time. Please note that this feature of Google Analytics is available only in the mobile app, so that’s where you should look. It’s something that I will now be looking at on client’s sites, and something I recommend that everyone look at. I do think it’s worth using Google’s machine learning to see if it can offer actual business insights that can make a difference to your business. If you give it a shot, and it provides you with a helpful suggestion, please let us know. Thanks.

Bill Slawski says: 09/10/2016 at 6:15 pm Hi Calgary SEO Solutions, Whether or not you agree with the suggestions in this new automated assistant or not; the chance to receive suggestions that might be founded upon actual business insights is a good opportunity. The Occam’s Razor website is definitely a thoughtful one, worth spending some time at. Dave Durden says: 09/11/2016 at 3:20 am Hi Bill, This was a real eyeopener, thank you! It’s interesting to see how automation and AI are turning simple data into actionable insight. I’m intrigued to see the extent to which automation will evolve in the future – perhaps fully automated consultancy companies? Bill Slawski says: 09/11/2016 at 11:50 am Hi Dave, I don’t know if we will see fully automated consulting; but it is interesting that Google is offering these suggestion. I guess we will learn how helpful they are by keeping an eye upon them, and seeing what they suggest. Soti says: 09/11/2016 at 12:52 pm Hi Bill, i just wanted to thank you for opening my eyes. The new analytics of google, that’s similar what i searched for. Thank you. Bill Slawski says: 09/11/2016 at 6:03 pm Hi Soti, You’re welcome. I thought this was interesting enough so that as many people as possible should hear about it – it provides all of us a boost when it comes to analytics, even those of us who don’t know how to take advantage of the statistics associated with our sites. Adrian says: 09/12/2016 at 4:26 am I came across this new feature yesterday and my first reaction was …. blah another Google trick to try to get me to commit to bigger spending on their ad network, but then i checked again and noticed that some of the reports are very insightful and after all tips coming from the horses mouth are always to be given some consideration ! Ashish says: 09/13/2016 at 12:58 pm I have been using Google analytics for quite a while now, Although it provides the good information but times to times it is not always correct if we compare it to other premium services. Beside that I really loved your article. Keep posting Thanks Chris says: 09/13/2016 at 8:56 pm I’m glad I came across this tonight. I didn’t even realize there was more insight and advice coming straight from Google that I could use for my business and clients sites. Thank you! Jack says: 09/15/2016 at 8:58 am I second that. Though the data is not accurate, and I personally find some number being listed wrong there. But the thing is, those are just estimates, of the past month’s trend. And the are just precise approximations. I often study Google trends along with that, make a guess on the exact search volume which a potential keyword might fetch. What do you think about this method, Bill? Hussain Omar says: 09/16/2016 at 1:32 am Hey Bill, This is my first visit to your blog and I really loved it. And yes, the analytics software should provide more than just visits figures, I think Moz and SEMrush do provide suggestions on the paid subscriptions, but if Google will provide it, that will be a nice feature to try. Thanks for sharing! Regards Hussain Stephen Love says: 09/16/2016 at 3:56 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for the information and the heads up, having just passed my analytics exam i will certainly follow up on some of the links you have provided to get a better understanding of how this could benefit us. Matthew says: 09/16/2016 at 10:54 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for sharing the articles within your post. I’m still relatively beginner level in understanding Google Analytics and I took the advice you shared on this article which has helped my understanding greatly so I appreciate it. These were things I never knew to think about until I read here so I look forward to many more of your posts. Am going to experiment with the automated assistant suggestions in the mobile app. Abdul Waheed says: 09/19/2016 at 10:20 am Great info about analytics, thanks for sharing that, Bill says: 09/19/2016 at 1:07 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for pointing this out. The suggestions provided by Google Analytics helped me identify a couple of new topics to write about. Interesting that it is only available on the mobile app. Bill Slawski says: 09/19/2016 at 2:11 pm Hi Bill, I wondered about the availability of this feature only on Mobile, too. I guess they wanted to see if they could influence more people to use the mobile app, by making this feature exclusive to mobile. Bill Slawski says: 09/19/2016 at 2:13 pm Hi Abdul, You’re welcome. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/19/2016 at 2:17 pm Hi Matthew, I hope it goes well. The suggestions I’ve been seeing look interesting. I think implementing those would be helpful in getting you to learn more. teddy slim says: 09/19/2016 at 6:14 pm Clearly, Google is trying to own the web and I’m not with Google monopolizing the net Candice S says: 09/19/2016 at 8:52 pm Bill thank your your post! yes google analytics is not very accurate and everytime a customer enter by mobile and change to view in desktop it simply count as two! but the view duration keep underestimate! yet the good thing about analytics is they can filter bots access.will check the automated assistant and get back again here after testing. hope google can do a better job! Harish Negi says: 09/20/2016 at 6:21 am Google is making Life easy for bloggers. Will definitely use this. Thanks for bringing into knowledge. Chicago SEO Pros says: 09/21/2016 at 2:56 pm Any help from Google, in any form, is much appreciated. Sometimes my brain gets so wrapped up in knots trying to decipher what little reliable data there is. Thank you for the tips. faran says: 09/23/2016 at 6:36 am first i wouldn’t know what to do with my writing but google makes it easier, and also word press gives direction. thank you for you information sharing David S. Freid says: 09/24/2016 at 3:56 pm Thank you for your enlightening article, I was unaware of this feature and will look forward to installing the mobile app. I will also share my thought about considering any suggestions coming from this Google Bot. (i.e. Automated Assitant) It has been my experience that the G-Bots all support and follow the same Google Guidelines. Just saying… David S. Freid says: 09/24/2016 at 4:04 pm Great Post! I was unaware of this feature and will look forward to the app. I also would like to share that personally, I would have to consider any suggestions coming from a G Bot. It has been my experience that all G Bots support and follow the same Google Guidelines. I should add, this coming from one that considers himself a “Google Guideline Junkie”. “Real SEO has no ending… you can always something to optimize, better. Jim says: 09/24/2016 at 5:12 pm Hi Bill, do you agree if google analytic will track all your data and decrease your position in SERP ? I need your reason.Thank you Bill Sara Mazher says: 09/25/2016 at 2:58 am It is interesting that Google is offering these suggestion. I guess we will learn how helpful they are by keeping an eye upon them, and seeing what they suggest. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:27 am Hi Jim, This new feature from Google on the Mobile Google App provides machine learned insights for you to apply to your site and has nothing to do with affecting your position in Search results. Take a look at the suggestions that it offers, and see if they are something that you want to apply to your site; you don’t have to, but it’s possible that they might help you site. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:33 am Hi Teddy, I’m not sure that this GA assistant is aimed at Google monopolizing the Web. Take a look at the suggestions, and if you want to follow them, try them out. If you think they may cause a problem, then don’t. I do think they are worth looking at, though. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:36 am Hi Candice, I hope it offers you some helpful suggestions. I’ve been noticing the suggestions have been updating, but the Assistant was right that I should write a post like this one, geared towards providing some suggestions and advice the way this one has. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:38 am Hi Harish, I hope it is helpful for you. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:55 am Hi David, I hope the suggestions it may offer you are helpful ones. Wade Cockfield says: 09/25/2016 at 8:50 pm Thanks for the article looks like I will have to start using the app rather than desktop. Alisha says: 09/27/2016 at 12:46 am Thanks for sharing these useful informations regarding google analytics. It is really helpful for people like me. Lakhyajyoti says: 09/27/2016 at 9:48 am I have been using GA Assistant for last few weeks. Really love the features of the new tool. Thanks for the awesome share. Kettletop Tea says: 09/27/2016 at 10:49 am Great blog. Fully informative. I am also seo executive , so thank for blog. David says: 09/27/2016 at 6:57 pm Not gonna lie, I didn’t even know there was a mobile app for Google Analytics (though it doesn’t surprise me). I’ve never really found the need to check my analytics when I was somewhere I couldn’t access my computer, but I guess I’ll have to download it now if only to check out this apparently mobile-exclusive feature! Mike Mallery says: 09/29/2016 at 8:38 pm Hi Bill. I stumbled upon your blog, and I can say that I am happy I did. Great information to be found here. More on the subject, though – I always find it interesting that so many businesses are looking for the answers found within GA; however, they always seem to be terrified of anything technology related. As you pointed out, there is a great deal of information to be found within GA. With a little effort and understanding, so many business owners could have a much better grasp on the performance of their site(s) and how they can improve. However, I suppose that ignorance keeps some of us in business. Not to drag this out too much longer, but thank you for the links to these articles I have missed. They are on my ‘to read’ list over the weekend. Keep churning out the great content. patel vaishali says: 09/29/2016 at 11:23 pm Yes, I am using Google Assistant by the first day of its launch. It is awesome. Machine learning goes beyond its expectations. Google is back with the bang. seo service says: 09/30/2016 at 3:49 am Nice post Bill. Nice informative post.I knew about the Google Analytics toll which is available on PC but didn’t know about the mobile version of it. I’ll definitely try it. Noman says: 09/30/2016 at 8:23 am Really good news for us.This time we will get a lot of valuable data.but what about desktop user? I think this service must be available for desktop user too.thanks for your informative post. Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:31 am Hi Mike, Google Analytics contains some useful information, but the suggestions that it offers can sometimes be missed by people when they use it. The value of this automated assistant is in its ability to make clear suggestions that are easy to follow. It suggested that I write a post that was similar to other ones based upon information that was very actionable, which lead me to write this post. I’m glad I listened to it – it was good advice, and a lot of people seem to have missed the Google blog post announcing the GA assistant, which I wouldn’t have seen because I hadn’t been using the mobile version of the app. I need to go look now, and see if it has any updates. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:33 am Hi Patel, I’m happy with the suggestions that I’ve been seeing from the automated assistant. Yes, it’s analytics and not SEO, but it is helping me improve my website, and there is value in that. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:37 am Hi SEO Service, I can only guess that Google wanted to see if they could get more people using the mobile version of Google Analytics if they offered the Assistant exclusively through that mobile version. It forced me to give it a try, and it was worth trying, I’m liking what it is suggesting. Going to try it out again right now. Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:46 am Hi Noman, I’ve taken to working with my phone and tablet next to my desktop computer – the notifications from those tell me about whether I have new messages on social media. I suspect that Google might make that Automated assistant available on desktop versions of Google Analytics some time soon. We’ll see when they do. Matt says: 09/30/2016 at 4:04 pm It is honestly sad that I am an SEO and didn’t know this. I’m going to go check it out right now. Thank you for sharing Bill! Bren Murphy says: 10/01/2016 at 4:42 am Hi Bill, It’s a nice new feature and I have given it full reign across my web service – let’s see how well it works! Very positive about it so far, Thanks Bren Munna Hossain says: 10/04/2016 at 11:43 am I am really happy to read your article. This is really an awesome news for us that we can use google automated assistant. But I think it will be more helpful if desktop users get this facilities. Thanks you for your wonderful article. Entersoft says: 10/04/2016 at 6:01 pm Google automated assistant is good, although it is not quite “there” yet! I look forward to reading “the biggest mistakes”. Nice work. Cheers! Terrence says: 10/04/2016 at 7:24 pm This is very much interesting. Google analytics is very much helpful to track down how many traffic do you have on your website as well as the keywords of what users always search in a certain category. Good to know about Google assistant, ’till now, I’m still in the process of navigating this stuff. Bill Slawski says: 10/04/2016 at 7:59 pm Hi Entersoft, Google Analytics is a mature product, so I’m not sure that we will see many “biggest mistakes”. The suggestions the Assistant is offering are based upon information that may or may not be being picked up on by someone looking at analytics. I have seen up to 10 suggestions at a time per site I’ve looked at. I can see people seeing value from the Assistant. Bill Slawski says: 10/04/2016 at 8:03 pm Hi Munna, I think good advice is still good advice regardless if it is delivered on a desktop app or a mobile one. I hope that people don’t let it being available only on mobile stop them from using the assistant. nandita says: 10/05/2016 at 1:16 am This is truly a great post @Bill It would a smarter method and it will be very useful. pcmate says: 10/09/2016 at 7:50 am Hi there Bill, I have just founded your blog and my first impression is amazing! You don’t give just techniques about SEO, but you also inform about new things about it. It’s true that Google is helping us lately a lot with this program and also AMP. Bill Slawski says: 10/09/2016 at 8:38 pm Hi pcmate, Thank you. I’m happy to hear that you are enjoying my posts. Tha automated assistant is an interesting feature from Google. I was a little upset that the last time I logged into the mobile app, there were no suggestions for me – it was nice seeing some. Sarvesh says: 10/14/2016 at 6:21 am Thanks Bill for such informative article. Really most of the internet user not aware about this new automated assistant. Marbella says: 10/16/2016 at 12:47 pm I have been using GA Assistant for last few weeks. Really love the features of the new tool. Thanks for share ,it is awesome. Ascendant SEO says: 10/21/2016 at 1:14 pm Thanks for your time in sharing this article. Analytics have definitely yielded a few helpful nuggets over the years for us. Obviously, it’s always helpful to be open to solutions and opportunities wherever they appear from. This topic relates in my mind to the basic issue of whether or not to become a Google Partner and go through the Adwords and Analytics training and certification. It’s interesting to meet people in the SEO space that write off the whole opportunity because they see Google as an opponent. In my experience with the program, I’ve learned a ton and am always reminded that Google has created a huge opportunity for us. Indeed, we need to be careful not to overlook the opportunities right in front of us. Analytics is one of those. shamala says: 11/01/2016 at 10:45 pm Thanks Bill, as always, for your vigilance and thorough patent analysis. InfoCreeds says: 11/06/2016 at 11:31 pm Yeah, that’s great. Google new automated assistant is great and also in India it is released in Local language (Hindi). It is improved after you are using it.

One minute a giant bid battle is brewing for Twitter, the next, all but one of its supposed suitors are running for the hills. With Google, Disney and Apple all reportedly ruling out a takeover of the struggling social network, only Salesforce is left in the running, with no guarantee it will come forward with a genuine offer. Twitter has been struggling since its early days as a public company, and some critics would argue that its mistake was joining the stock market in the first place. Now, with its options dwindling fast, it faces a bleak future. Certainly the market thinks its prospects as an independent company are pretty dismal: Twitter’s share price plunged more than 20pc after the news that the number of potential bidders had dropped to one. What a dramatic change in fortunes for a company that burst onto the stock market amid huge fanfare just three years ago. At the time, investors thought they were backing the next Facebook or Google and ploughed into its shares, leaving its founder and early backers sitting on huge fortunes. It floated at $26 a share and by the end of the first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Twitter’s stock price had hit nearly $45: the listing was hailed as a slam-dunk on Wall Street. However, within months, several analysts had downgraded the company, and the blue bird has been back-pedalling ever since. Its shares are now languishing at less than $20. Wall Street is notoriously bad at valuing tech companies, but Twitter is in danger of being remembered alongside other over-hyped ventures that left shareholders with badly burnt fingers, such as Zynga and Groupon. The bidding debacles raises fears that Twitter could have been overvalued like Groupon Twitter’s problems are well documented: it has yet to make a profit and its user numbers have ground to a halt. Management, including founder Jack Dorsey, who has returned as chief executive, seem unsure about how to reverse its fortunes. Its biggest problem perhaps is that Twitter wants to be a real business yet no one has worked out whether one exists. It’s traffic doesn’t generate transactions, like with Google, and users don’t spend long periods on the site, like Youtube or Facebook, so its prospects are uncertain. Maybe a very different future awaits? Some critics think it is best suited to becoming another online public service, along the same lines as Wikipedia. It may sound fanciful but unless Twitter’s management come up with a proper plan soon, the social network’s days may be numbered. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey returned to the floundering social network Credit: Bloomberg Cautionary tale The fate of Twitter should provide a cautionary tale for UK investors as they ponder the forthcoming return of Misys to the stock market this month. The software giant’s boss insists that it has been transformed. He would say that, of course. Nadeem Syed and senior management are sitting on shares worth a staggering £330m, as we reveal today. The company’s private equity backer, Vista, and a long list of investment banks working on the float, also stand to profit handsomely. However, a cynic might argue that the biggest transformation that looks to have taken place is the jump in the company’s debt pile. In the four years Misys has been in private hands, its borrowings have ballooned from £107m to £1.3bn. Misys provides software for the world's biggest banks Credit: Bloomberg Vista points out that Misys has undertaken two big deals since de-listing, and revenue and earnings have also risen during its ownership, but at the relatively pedestrian pace of 0.7 times and two times respectively, against a 12-times jump in debt. This, then, has a strong whiff of the classic private equity flip, which were common before the financial crisis but looked to have been stubbed out after investors had their fingers burnt too many times. Boomerang floats, where companies go private, then return to the stock market, come with a particular health warning, because too often they have undergone little real change during private ownership.   In the case of Misys, there is even more reason to be sceptical, given its dubious record last time it was a public company. Its last couple of years were so uninspiring that when Vista swooped in 2012, some investors almost seemed relieved to see the back of it. This time around, the company needs to execute a textbook float, or its backers will have to face a full-scale City revolt.

That omnipotence was on full display at Home's debut in San Francisco (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)   PCMag.com Compared with Amazon's Echo, Google Home -- a compact speaker you can ask to turn off the lights, check the weather, and play music -- might seem like a latecomer to the smart home party. It doesn't arrive until November, while the Echo has been conversing with connected home enthusiasts for nearly two years and has two spinoff devices, the Echo Dot and Tap. But the $129 Google Home has one huge advantage over the Alexa-powered Echo, Siri, and every other personal digital assistant on the market: Google already knows everything about you and pretty much everything that's on the internet. That omnipotence was on full display at Home's debut in San Francisco yesterday, where PCMag got to play with it. All you have to do is say is "OK, Google, tell me about my day," and the diminutive speaker launches into a monologue about your life. It will tell you the weather, how long it will take you to get to work, what's on your calendar, and a news briefing from a source of your choice. All of that is pulled from Google products you probably already use, like Gmail, Calendar, and Maps, though you can disable access to certain corners of the Google ecosystem if you want to. Of course, Google Home also has access to Google's Web search, which means instant answers to a huge variety of questions, from the New England Patriots' season record (3-1) to the name of the Canadian prime minister (Justin Trudeau). Google Home also works well as a music server, beaming songs from a variety of cloud sources. At launch, you'll be able to chose from Spotify, Pandora, YouTube Music, Google Play Music, and TuneIn. Like everything else, playing audio is customizable. You can simply tell Home to play some jazz, or you can ask it to play a curated Spotify playlist on your living room surround sound system, with Google Cast making the connection. To accomplish the latter, you'd say something like "OK, Google. Play Beyoncé on my speakers," assuming they're connected to a Chromecast Audio. Google Home is always listening, and you can say "OK, Google" any time you want it to respond. In the crowded demo room, with many journalists and Google employees all speaking at once, it only understood about half of the commands I tried. But Google says that its omnidirectional microphone is designed to filter out anything that's not a human voice, so it should work well in a quieter room. To adjust the volume, there's a touch interface on the top of the speaker that's reminiscent of an iPod click wheel or a rotary telephone. You slide your finger in a clockwise circular motion, and lights illuminate to indicate increased volume. The device's design is inspired by wineglasses and candles, so it looked great in the Martha Stewart-esque demo room. It will also likely bring a touch of class to your living room or kitchen whether or not you've hired an interior designer. The speaker grille, which takes up the bottom of the device, is interchangeable and snaps on with a magnet. Both metal and fabric grilles in various colors are available. If you want Google Home to temporarily stop listening, you can press the mute button on the rear of the speaker. It's the only physical button, which seems appropriate for a device that's designed for voice interaction. Google Home will come with an Android and iOS companion app, which is still under development. It can do things like adjust which news sources or music libraries are connected, as well as control your home's lights and temperature while you're away. (For automation, Home works with Philips Hue, Nest, Samsung SmartThings, and IFTTT). I was only offered a brief glimpse of the companion app and wasn't allowed to take photos, but it appeared similar to the Alexa app, albeit with Google's trademark fonts and colors. The big question with Google Home, other than how it stacks up against Echo, is whether or not you're comfortable with giving it so much access to your digital life. Google says you'll be able to prevent Home from accessing certain information sources, but then you'd be robbing the speaker of much of its functionality. Google knows so much about your life anyway that allowing Home to offer that information to you in spoken form probably won't increase your risk of snooping or identity theft.

The idea behind Assistant is that Google wants to build a Google for each person, not just a Google for everyone, Pichai said. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Google chief executive Sundar Pichai proclaimed Tuesday that we're evolving from a mobile-first world to an "AI-first world" -- and, of course, that Google is going to be at the forefront of that evolution. But to do that, Google is investing heavily in mobile -- specifically, smartphones. The tech giant introduced two new phones, the 5-inch Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL, at a San Francisco keynote event. The phones boast a camera that Google said earned a top rating for a smartphone camera, an unlimited amount of online photo storage, and a battery that gives you seven hours of battery life from just 15 minutes of charging. The new Pixel phones carry branding that identify them as "Phone by Google," which is a departure from the old Nexus "partner" branding but a crucial turn in what the company is trying to do: owning the phones as its own. Despite the fact that both are made by HTC, Google takes credit for designing the phones around Google Assistant, the tech giant's answer to Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. The idea behind Assistant is that Google wants to build a Google for each person, not just a Google for everyone, Pichai said. Users will be able to ask broad questions such as, "OK Google, what do I have to do today?" and more conversational queries that (ideally) won't have your so-called smart assistant flummoxed by your phrasing. "Why should we build hardware?" said Rick Osterloh, Google's newly appointed head of hardware. His answer was something we've heard from Apple for years: that building hardware and software together allows companies to take full advantage of both, by designing them for each other. Yet, while Osterloh borrowed some familiar phrases from Apple, Google's pitch came with a twist. The next revolution, Osterloh said, will take place at the intersection of hardware and software together -- with AI in the middle. "The technology needs to be smart and just work for you," Osterloh said. The Pixel phones start at $649, and will have either 32 GB or 128 GB of storage. It is also compatible with Google's new VR headset, the Daydream View. The phones will come in three colors -- which Google has oddly named "Quite Black," "Very Silver" and "Really Blue." In the United States, it will be a Verizon exclusive. Pixel will also be available unlocked on the Google Store.

Bloomberg photo by Michael Short   Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman Bloomberg     Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a yearlong odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company's retail efforts. What's more, it's inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies' in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google's digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa and Apple's Siri. "We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome," UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It's working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google's online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn't enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. "Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships," he said. Many of Google's past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google's target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google's sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn't want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product's complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google's new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a "journey," gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone's full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. "We're in it for the long run," he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can reabsorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company's sales aspirations. "In markets where we do business, we're definitely going to want meaningful share," he said. "But it's highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume." Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple's devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. "The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system," he said.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   PCMag.com     Google seems to think we live lonely lives. As it positions its Google Home as a flexible virtual assistant, it doesn't seem to know what to do if a Google home is full of different people with different tastes. This is especially key for Google, because its Assistant is dependent on assembling a profile of your lifestyle and desires based on your Google account. Yes, that's creepy; the idea that Google is surveilling you so intensely that it's constructing a profile of all of your tastes and preferences. But that's what it's doing. If you don't like it, don't buy a Google Home. Also, probably don't use Gmail. Setting that aside, at our house, we have three people with different tastes and opinions on things. We have different to-do lists and different sets of reminders, sure, but the more you get into the "intelligent assistant" world, the more answers are going to become different based on preferences. Take the ubiquitous "traffic to work" query that these assistants always like to show in their demos. Most American households have two people in them who go to work at different times, at different places. But that's just the least subtle tip of the iceberg. A smart assistant with knowledge of TV preferences, for instance, could deal with the query "put something on TV that's the next episode of something I was watching." My daughter doesn't want to unwind with Person of Interest, and Steven Universe is not my first choice in entertainment. It's good and all, just not my first choice. That said, folks in a single household shouldn't have their libraries and preferences held completely separate. If my daughter asks me to buy Steven Universe, I shouldn't have to worry about adding a payment method to her account. Google, Amazon, and Apple all have family sharing options on most of their products to solve this problem. Amazon allows multiple accounts on its Echo virtual-assistant products. Just say "switch accounts," and it'll change who it thinks is talking to Alexa. But Google confirmed that Google Home will only work with one account: @saschasegan Hi! Today, Google Home supports a single account on the device but you can use multiple accounts with your music services. This seems to be an early product issue. Google solved the multiple-accounts problem on Android in 2012. Since Google Home isn't coming out until November, hopefully it'll be solved by then. The Echo's "switch account" command is a little clumsy, true. Ideally, these voice interfaces should be able to tell the difference between the voices of different people in a household, and it would surprise me if that's not possible given the Skynet level of cloud computing going on at both Google and Amazon. And once you have a family set up, there are more interesting things Google Home could do. For instance, I could ask Google Home how many hours my daughter has spent watching Chromecast over the past week, and to tell me when that goes past 10 hours. Or my wife could leave a note for when I get home, that only I could hear. Google Home is going to need some sort of multiple-user function if it's going to be a working intelligent assistant in a family context. Hopefully, it'll come by launch.

Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Edward Helmore in Pittsburgh Saturday 8 October 2016 07.00 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.28 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger When Uber chose to test its robot-driven taxis in Pittsburgh, some may have wondered why the tech company had chosen America’s former capital of steel for its road test into the future. But for those in the know, Pennsylvania’s second city is well on its way to establishing itself as the Silicon Valley of the east – and even its roads are helping. Unlike many American cities, Pittsburgh road system is literally off the grid, its origins dating back to twisty, pre-revolution forest trails. Then there are the city’s 446 bridges to navigate. More importantly Pittsburgh boasts the robotics department at Carnegie-Mellon University, recognized as the leading academic institution in the field. Uber’s first self-driving car spotted in Pittsburgh Read more It was here last month that Pittsburgh opened its doors to show the world why it is so well positioned to be a new tech hub. The city is now in a position to capitalize on the infrastructure of the past in ways that could not have been anticipated at the depths of its post-industrial depression two decades ago, when the city’s population was half its industry peak and the unemployment rate was worse than in Detroit. Last week, the city hosted Thrival, a three-day showcase of panel discussions and exhibitions designed to show off the city’s post-industrial charms. From robotics to biotech, performing arts to healthcare, the city’s premier boosters – many locals or returning natives – sought to describe the city’s upswing. The twin keys to the city’s current success, says the festival’s executive producer, Dan Law, are education and medicine – eds and meds – that helped bridge the gap between old industrial Pittsburgh and a new Pittsburgh that’s about innovation and technology. Now, instead of leaving, students from Pittsburgh’s tech university departments have more options to stay. “Eds and meds are the bedrock of the economic transition,” says Law. “UPMC – University of Pittsburgh Medical Center – alone is a $13bn health system and there are dozens of ancillary industries that began to innovate. So young people started to get jobs here and economic growing around the core economic pillars.” Correspondingly, the city’s arts and culture are thriving. “The City of Bridges is in the throes of a full-on nose-to-tail, barrel-aged, small-plates culinary renaissance,” according to Bon Appetit magazine. It rated one Spanish restaurant, Morcilla, the fourth best restaurant in the US. There’s a trendy Ace Hotel that was originally a YMCA and, of course, the Warhol Museum, dedicated to its most famous artist, and the Carnegie Museums of Art. How community-led renovation is helping a rundown Pittsburgh neighbourhood fight crime Read more “At the centre of it all, Pittsburgh is becoming a diversified innovation economy,” say Luke Skurman, founder of Niche.com and one of the founders of Thrill Mill, a not-for-profit organization providing mentorship and collaborative workspace to early-stage startups. “When I graduated Carnegie Mellon and stayed, people thought I was bananas. Now it’s becoming fashionable to do so.” Among the attendees at Thrival were Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian American neuropathologist who was the first to discover and publish findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players, and Jennifer Krusius, general manager at Uber. The transportation firm has about 500 employees in the city’s tech Strip district and plans to start testing as many as 100 Volvo sport utility vehicles on the city’s streets. Many of Uber’s employees were hired directly from Carnegie-Mellon’s computer labs and the state’s approach to the technology – called greenlight governing – effectively encouraged investment in the field. Uber estimates its investment will reach $1bn over the next few years. “It’s not just about self-driving cars,” says Law. “It’s about the future of urban mobility. How do you create smarter and more efficient cities.” Pittsburgh is ideal, he says, “because if you are going to design a car that needs to navigate some of the most complex road networks and systems, you’re not going to get a bigger challenge than here. It’s old, it was planned poorly, it’s built around hills and valleys, and the roads are windy and steep. If it works in Pittsburgh, it can work anywhere.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A self-driving Uber car drives navigates one of Pittsburgh’s many bridges. Photograph: Gene J Puskar/AP The firm is not alone: General Motors, Google – which has centered its engineering facilities here and employs 600 – and Intel have also come to Pittsburgh. While Apple, which employs 500 here, has not stated the reason for its interest, it is known to have already developed a prototype vehicle. But the city’s easy-going regulatory approach and an intelligent workforce is not the only reason Pittsburgh is becoming ground zero for auto-automation, widely regarded as one of the largest untapped economies. Google’s Mike Capsambelis explains the company’s explicit interest in Pittsburgh is machine learning, a sub-field of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. In other words, learning without needing to be explicitly programmed. “It’s uniquely a collaborative place. We tend to work together even when there’s actual competition,” says Capsambelis. Pittsburgh water: expensive, rust-colored, corrosive, and high in lead Read more Rasu Shrestha, chief innovation officer at UPMC, says healthcare is a natural fit for machine learning. Healthcare, he says, is so muchabout billing and book-keeping. “We want to free the data, to empower patients and consumers to take charge of their own data with the right sets of systems,” says Shrestha. “So the question is, how do we do a better job of precision medicine, not just do a better job of billing and documentation? The entrepreneurial knack is not just to create incremental innovation but to change the entire dynamic of healthcare innovation.” Tech companies, including Google, eye healthcare’s copious resources of data – UPMC’s nine petabytes of data is doubling every 18 months – with some envy. And vice versa. Says Shrestha: “Let’s create solutions that leverage machine learning and big-data-type technologies to create products we can then commercialize.” There may also be a natural symbiosis between healthcare advances and tech’s interest in transport. An ageing population suggests more will need assistance in terms of mobility. “There’s a ton of connections and overlap,” says Capsambelis. “A lot of people will still need cars, but there won’t be as many drivers.” The spirit of entrepreneurship suffuses the robotics lab at Carnegie-Mellon. Not only has tech become a major employer of the university’s graduates, but much of the computational power that was once available only to universities or government laboratories is now available to research. “Having machine learning has really changed the way we do research because the things we used to do at the university, companies can do much better because of their access to huge computing power and big data,” says professor of computer science Lenore Blum. But the city and its promoters at Thrival and Thrill Mill are keen to show off the small entrepreneurs along with the grand-scale technology behemoths that are beginning to occupy the same psychic space in the culture that the robber barons Carnegie and Frick did here in the late 19th century. An app for artists to find spaces, for instance, or a machine-learning ECG device for early stroke detection. Another involves cooking recipes for the sight-impaired. They may not or ever be Google or Uber but they are nonetheless imbibing Pittsburgh’s spirit of innovation. “It looks more like a continuum to us,” says Thrill Mill’s Stephan Mueller, “because we all have this fatal love for Pittsburgh and want to do something for it.” More features Topics Pennsylvania Apple Uber Google Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

From December 1st, core GMS package apps will no longer bundle Hangouts with a new device. But this doesn’t mean that the Google is killing Hangouts, instead it will reportedly be replaced by Google Duo, and it will optional for OEMs to keep Hangouts in default app suite or not, as per the purported email statement by Google, which notes: Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016. This doesn’t come as a surprise because is Google is betting high on its cross-platform Duo, and Hangouts has never been a success.

Google Duo to Replace Hangouts as the Main Video-Chatting App for Android Phones GO Google Duo will become a mandatory preinstall for Android Oct 8, 2016 10:40 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  In an email to its partners, Google reportedly announced a significant change to the core GMS package for Android smartphones. Starting December, the tech giant will no longer include Hangouts in the list of applications bundled with new hardware. “Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016,” Google stated in the email, according to Android Police. This means that manufacturers will have the option to stop including Google Hangouts on smartphones released in 2017. Users would have to download and install the application from the Play Store if they wish to use it. Google will transform Hangouts into a business communications platform Google intends to replace Hangouts with Duo on the GMS package for Android smartphones and not Allo. Hangouts did offer video-calling options to its users and Google wanted to find a fitting equivalent, in the form of Duo. However, Allo is a much more complex application, with its Google Assistant integration that allows smart replies and lots of other useful features. Allo is currently competing against other popular third-party messaging solutions, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Kik, and LINE. It seems that Google might be trying to transform Hangouts into a business communications platform, so the app will be focusing on the collaborative group productivity market. This means that the app will continue to live on, but it’s unknown for how long. Meanwhile, Google’s Duo continues to gain popularity, as the app surpassed the 10 million downloads mark on the Play Store. It offers an easy way to place video calls, with tools that prevent the app from dropping the call if Wi-Fi or network connectivity is lacking. It also has a very neat Knock Knock feature that shows a video of the caller before picking up. #Google#Duo#Hangouts#Allo#Android subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Allo Developer Lists 7 Most Requested Features, Including SMS Support Google Allo Passes 5 Million Downloads Mark on Android Allo Takes a Step Back on Privacy in Favor of Google Assistant Features Google’s Allo Lets Users Delete Messages from Chat History 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background    Google Hangouts logo New Android APKs Facebook Messenger APK: Updated November 14th, 06:30 GMT Facebook APK: Updated November 14th, 06:28 GMT Facebook APK: Updated November 14th, 06:23 GMT PokéMesh APK: Updated November 14th, 06:20 GMT Taskbar APK: Updated November 14th, 06:16 GMT Google Sheets APK: Updated November 14th, 06:13 GMT Maps APK: Updated November 14th, 05:23 GMT Reader comments Pictures and Specs of Google's Canned Project ARA Smartphone Leaked Out more on: Project Ara i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the first smartphones to be “Made by Google.” They may have been manufactured by HTC, but make no mistake, that G on the back is very important. This is a major strategy shift for Google, and one that is long overdue. By taking end-to-end control of software and hardware, Google can elevate Android to the next level, addressing its major shortcomings. It’s a move that shows a willingness to stand toe-to-toe against Apple and shrug off any lingering deference to dominant Android partners like Samsung. How did we get here? When Google started the Open Handset Alliance it was reliant on hardware partners like HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony. It was only through them that Google could position itself on the majority of the world’s smartphones. The Nexus line was never a serious attempt to muscle in on the market. It grew out of a desire to produce a reference device for developers to test on. The marketing muscle and cutting-edge technology that really drove Android adoption came from Google’s partners. All of them had been caught flat-footed by Apple’s iPhone and Google stepped into the software void and allowed them to compete again. It has largely been a mutually beneficial arrangement, but over time, the line between the open ideals of the platform at its conception and Google’s stewardship have grown increasingly blurred. Google has found itself walking a tightrope; trying to persuade partners to follow its advice, but unable to really bare its teeth for fear of them abandoning the platform. For years it looked as though gaining a foothold on devices through the software might be enough for Google, but stepping into hardware is the only way that the company can realize its vision for Android. To fully understand this move we have to consider the platform’s weaknesses. The problems with Android In the early days of Android its competitors bemoaned the complexity of the platform. It lacked the elegant simplicity and accessibility of iOS. Google worked hard to catch up and possibly even surpass its rival. In truth, the two platforms have far more in common today than features that divide them, but the idea that Android is harder to get to grips with has stuck. It’s an idea that has been reinforced by fragmentation — the Achilles heel of Android. androidn_headerMore There is no standardized Android experience because there are so many different versions of the platform out there on so many different handsets. Google never dictated hardware rules and that helped Android to grow quickly. But, while budget devices have propelled the platform into pole position, they’ve also often made for a poor experience. There’s a much bigger gap between a budget Android device and a flagship like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 than there is between the latest iPhone and the S7. Manufacturers desperate to differentiate themselves from the Android competition layered their own software on top of Android. This has muddied the waters further, negatively impacted performance, and led to excessive bloatware with lesser versions of Google’s apps set as defaults on many devices. As the underlying operating system has improved, these manufacturer UIs have grown increasingly superfluous, but what’s worse is that they’ve effectively blocked Google from rolling out important Android security updates when it wants to. There’s a multitude of hardware and software combinations, so updates have to pass through countless manufacturer and carrier hoops before they can reach our phones. Read More This has left consumers adrift without the latest innovations from Mountain View, California. It has also left serious security vulnerabilities unpatched. There’s no way to spin that as a good thing for Android device owners. The Nexus devices addressed some of these problems, but they always felt like half-hearted releases from Google. They weren’t heavily marketed; they flew in the face of carriers; and Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. Complete control Google cannot put the fragmentation genie back in the bottle. It has to try something different. Taking complete control is a gamble, but Google is coming from a position of strength. Parent company, Alphabet, has never been in better health. This isn’t something that happened overnight, either. Google has been building towards this moment. It has worked with many of the world’s best hardware manufacturers. It owned Motorola Mobility for a while. It has also been quietly separating key features from the open Android platform and innovating through its own suite of apps instead. Google is now managing its own distribution and building a supply chain. Former Motorola chief Rick Osterloh was brought in specifically to build a hardware division. Google phones are now being developed in-house and the company intends to manage every facet, eventually designing its own “silicon” (customized processors), according to VP of Engineering Dave Burke in an interview with Bloomberg. More on fragmentation: Android is losing its battle with fragmentation, and you’re paying the price It’s that kind of tight control that has enabled Apple to achieve levels of performance that surpass the basic specs of the iPhone. That’s why the iPhone 7 has trounced Samsung’s latest and greatest in benchmarks and speed tests. The phenomenal success of Apple’s model cannot be denied. It only sold 17.2 percent of the smartphones on the market last year, but it secured 91 percent of the profits, according to Cannacord Genuity. Of course, to get anywhere near that level of success, Google will have to do a lot more than release a fast, expensive smartphone. It has to build the brand and show consumers why Pixel phones are worth paying a premium. The first phones of many The launch of Google’s new Pixel phones has been met with a mixed response. There’s a general perception that they’re too expensive, and they probably are, though that perception is partly because of the budget-priced expectation Google created with earlier releases in the Nexus line. But these phones aren’t supposed to illustrate what can be achieved to other manufacturers, they’re supposed to compete with the latest round of flagships. We’re already seeing predictions of relatively low sales, but it’s not like this is Google’s last throw of the dice. As Google integrates its artificial intelligence bot Assistant, not just into phones, but a whole line of hardware, buying into that ecosystem instead of Apple’s or Amazon’s becomes a more tempting prospect. The supply chain will solidify, the marriage of software and hardware will grow closer, and Google will continue to pour the lion’s share of its innovative goodies into Pixel phones that will surely get better and better. Hands on: Google guns for the big boys with the spec-stacked Pixel We’ve seen what Google can do with software. Android is the world’s most popular mobile operating system by far, with an 87.6 percent share of the worldwide market, according to IDC. But it didn’t conquer the world overnight. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This is a smart step for Android to take. It’s a necessary step, but let’s remember that it’s also the first step.

Panoramio, the service which Google acquired in 2007, will show its last image on November 4. Google previously tried to shut the service down in 2014. At the time, its users successfully petitioned the company to keep it open, Tech Crunch reported on Saturday. "Today, with photo upload tools in Google Maps and our Local Guides programme, we are providing easy options for you to share your photos with an active and growing community. As such, we've decided to now close down Panoramio," Google wrote in an email to Panoramio users on Saturday. Google is also encouraging Panoramio users to join its Local Guides programme and to upload photos directly to Google Maps. The users who have linked their Panoramio and Google+ accounts need not worry about their photos as Google will automatically copy their images to a Google Album archive. Users will still be able to access their photos in Panoramio for a year after November 4. --IANS sku/ask/bg Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Benami properties, gold next: PM Modi Donald Trump vows to immediately deport up to 3 million undocumented immigrants Banks shut today, ATMs open, withdraw Rs 2500 a day: Top developments After demonetisation, benami property holders the next target: PM Modi Demonetisation: Dear PM, please don't mock the people waiting in long queues More From Current Affairs Coolpad Note 5: A powerful value-for-money smartphone (Tech Review) Global carbon emissions remain flat for third year President, Vice President pay tributes to Nehru Tata Sons 'stooped low' in doubting neutral directors: Mistry Modi pays tribute to Pandit Nehru [ more ] Top Stories Money rush: ATMs will start dispersing Rs 2000 notes from today Amma is back, Modi in tears, Trump's $1 pay: 5 key developments of the day Shareholders vs board: Is opposing Tata Sons true sign of board independence?

The more upbeat the music, the more the listener will be motivated to push harder. And now Google is helping to fuel high-intensity workouts by providing the soundtrack to the user's next workout. Google teamed up with the fitness tracking app Runtastic to give Android users workout-inspired playlists that are powered by Play Music. Google Play Music's fitness playlist include a variety of different songs including those that are more than 130 beats per minute, which is the perfect tempo to synchronize with exercise to get the listener's heart rate up, burn calories and work up a sweat. Not only will the playlist keep users pumped since its consists of their favorite songs, but it will also be easier to forget about the burn and get lost in the music. The best part of it is that the Google Play Music ad-free playlists are available for Android users with the Runtastic app for free. While of course this seems to be like a great way to get more users on board Google's music streaming service, Android users don't need to have an account in order to jam along with this partnership. Starting on Friday, Oct. 7, users who launch the Runtastic app can start streaming Google Play Music's fitness playlists that are relevant to their activity. These include "Today's Running Hits" with music from Calvin Harris and Alesso, "Sweaty EDM Workout" with music from Avicii and Armin van Buuren, and "High-Energy Hard Rock" with music from Kings of Leon and The Black Keys. The songs play directly in the Runtastic app so that users can play, pause or skip while keeping track of their workout from one centralized location. This feature could help recruit new users who have Spotify or Apple Music and don't want to keep exiting and launching the two apps and interrupting their workouts. And while the playlists are free for Android users, Google is making sure iOS users don't miss out on what its streaming service has to offer. It announced that it is giving Runtastic users on both Android and iOS devices a free trial to Play Music so that they can stream creating their own playlists to work out to.

In a world where we rely on nearly 7 billion small screens that’s a tall order--but we’re toasting the first anniversary of AMP with progress the entire initiative can feel good about. From day one, a key focus for AMP has been speed.  Slow loading sites are arguably one of the most frustrating things about the mobile web. Recent Google research shows that 53% of people will leave a site that fails to load in three seconds or less. That’s the worst of all worlds for users, businesses, publishers, websites and the mobile web as a whole. For publishers, who were the first to get on board with AMP, the benefits of fast-loading content are super-tangible. In this case study, the Washington Post reported a 23% increase in mobile search users who return within 7 days. And in this case study, one of Europe’s biggest native advertising platforms, plista, conducted its own experiment among premium publishers like n-tv.de, faz.net, abendzeitung.de, and golem.de to measure AMP’s impact on web app widget speed and profitability. Average click-through rates for publishers improved by 220%, while one saw an increase of 600% after the implementation of AMP. To date the AMP project has been a story about momentum. This is clear in everything from the pace of releases of the open source code to the number of participants embracing the AMP format. From Pinterest to Reddit to Bing and Ebay, reports of success after adopting AMP have rolled in in recent months. At Google, we’re doing our part too. In February, we launched AMP in the “Top Stories” section of Google Search, delivering news in a fast and reliable way. In August, we previewed linking to AMPs across the entire mobile search results page. And this month we’re excited to be rolling out that faster experience to mobile users across Europe. Now when you search on your mobile device, you’ll see a label that indicates a page is AMP’d. This doesn’t change Search results but will show you which sites have pages that are ready to load lightning fast. Today AMP pages load from Google Search in less than one second on average. Beyond just saving time with fast loading pages, AMP also saves data -- AMP pages on Search use 10 times less data than the equivalent non-AMP page. To date we have over 600 million AMP documents created by sites all over the world (232 locales and 104 languages). These pages cover news content, retail, travel, recipes, general knowledge and entertainment. That’s a lot of fast-loading pages! The open source initiative is thriving because there is a strong community behind it getting involved in everything from working groups to contributing to the Github page with suggestions, feedback and code spec. While the first year of the AMP Project has gotten off to a good start, there still remains a lot of work ahead.  This roadmap is a good way to stay up to date on what is happening next. We look forward to returning in a year’s time with even more awesome progress as we work together to make the web great for everyone.

Panoramio, the service which Google acquired in 2007, will show its last image on November 4. Google previously tried to shut the service down in 2014. At the time, its users successfully petitioned the company to keep it open, Tech Crunch reported on Saturday. "Today, with photo upload tools in Google Maps and our Local Guides programme, we are providing easy options for you to share your photos with an active and growing community. As such, we've decided to now close down Panoramio," Google wrote in an email to Panoramio users on Saturday. Google is also encouraging Panoramio users to join its Local Guides programme and to upload photos directly to Google Maps. The users who have linked their Panoramio and Google+ accounts need not worry about their photos as Google will automatically copy their images to a Google Album archive. Users will still be able to access their photos in Panoramio for a year after November 4. --IANS sku/ask/bg SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

If you look at any relationship objectively, you'll see it goes through stages. Five stages test how real, deep and loyal the love between two individuals is. In most cases, if couples aren’t happy, they don’t reach beyond the third stage. However, if they let go off their ego and follow the forgive and forget route, there are full-fledged chances of a long-lasting relationship. Here are five stages of love and the ideal ways to overcome each. 1. Falling in love Image Credit: unsplash You feel as if you’re floating in the clouds. You feel like listening to Yashraj songs on loop. You feel like smiling for no reason. Falling in love is a phase to be cherished forever. It is this phase that makes us realise how capable we are of giving. You don’t need to make any effort to fall in love - it happens slowly at first and then all at once. 2. Coupling Image Credit: unsplash Here, you confess your love for each other and become a couple. Or one of you pops the question and goes ahead without fearing rejection. As you're aware, there could be two situations here - yes or no. If it's a no, you will have to accept that the other person doesn’t feel the same way as you do, and move on. If yes, then it’s a great feeling of love being reciprocated.  The only way to cross this stage is by initiation. It is when you express your true feelings for a person, that you move forward. You start with movies and lunch dates and end being comfortable with physical intimacy. By now, you probably know what your partner likes and dislikes. You’re in love and it shows. Everything is perfect, and everything is rosy.  3. Disillusionment Image Credit: unsplash Until you reach the third stage. By now, reality starts creeping in. It hits you hard. ‘Oh why do you always make sounds while eating?', ‘Why do you always have to keep a check on me?’, ‘Why do you always think I am looking at other girls?’. Fights like these start to occur in the third stage and it’s now suddenly a bed of thorns. At this stage, couples who are not sure about the future stop seeing each other and discontinue their relationship. Stronger couples successfully cross the third hurdle. It is this stage in a relationship where the couple’s patience and their love for each other is put through test. This hurdle can be crossed with love, trust and lots of patience. For instance, it’s necessary to forgive and forget after every fight. With understanding and mutual respect, disillusionment can be put behind. 4. Working on creating long-lasting love Image Credit: unsplash Once the third stage is behind, couples have to pour in more love, trust and respect to nurture the relationship, which then becomes unbreakable. By this stage, you have accepted your partner’s shortcomings and now look beyond their anger and tantrums. You are so close to each other that the thought of separation doesn’t even cross your mind. However, both of you have to work hard to keep the spark alive. Whether it's their birthday or an exciting trip they are going on, you’ve got to be psyched and you’ve got to be excited. 5. Taking over the world together Image Credit: unsplash It’s not you vs the world. Since you no longer have any doubts and qualms about your partner, you can now concentrate on doing things together to change the world. You are a team and can do anything, whether it's being the best couple, doing philanthropy or setting an example in perfect parenting. You’ve got to be a strong team and influence others to be the same.  973 facebook twitter reddit Comment Here ADVERTISEMENT Follow @indiatimes Next on Indiatimes Lifestyle: Anyone For 'LoC Pizza'?

Moto G (4th Gen), Moto G Plus (4th Gen), Moto G Play (4th Gen), Moto X Pure Edition (3rd Gen), Moto X Style, Moto X Play, Moto X Force, Droid Turbo 2, Droid Maxx 2, Moto Z, Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Force Droid, Moto Z Play, Moto Z Play Droid, Nexus 6. Do make a note that, there is no Moto E3 Power in this list, which means that the smartphone may not receive the update.   Samsung It is widely expected that almost all the 2015 and 2016 Samsung smartphones will be updated to Android 7.0 Nougat. The list includes Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, and the struggling Galaxy Note 7.

The smartphones are the flagship HTC 10, HTC One M9, and HTC One E9. HTC might push the update by the end of this year of early 2017. Sony Sony doesn't deliver the updates on time and as a result, their sales are depleting. However, Sony has already released the AOSP code of their Xperia Z3 and at the launch of Xperia XZ, they claimed that the Android N update will be released for all the Xperia X series smartphones and Xperia Xz in Q1 2017.

The Echo will soon face competition from Google and Apple.

The Dot and the portable Tap give the Echo's Alexa software even broader reach. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) By MAE ANDERSON, Associated Press Published: October 7, 2016, 11:37 PM A   A NEW YORK — Does your home really need a “smart speaker” to answer questions, call you an Uber, turn off the lights or play music when you ask? You may be about to find out. Two years ago, Amazon introduced the Amazon Echo, an unassuming, $180 cylinder that sits on a kitchen counter or bookshelf, acting as a personal assistant that listens to you and does your bidding. Initially, the point of gadget was a little difficult to discern. But Echo and its Alexa voice recognition software have since become a sleeper hit, with an estimated 3 million gadgets sold as of April, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Home ‘smart’ Now the Echo is getting some company. On Tuesday, Google announced a similar smart speaker called Google Home, which will be available in November for $129. It will perform many of the same tasks as Echo, including playing music and fielding questions plus controlling compatible lights and appliances. The Google Assistant that works with Home will also be able to access your calendar, Google Maps and other services if you allow. Apple has opened up its Siri personal assistant so third-party developers can create new features for it, much as Amazon has done with its Alexa software. Google Assistant is also opening up to outside apps in December. Sony is working on Xperia Agent, a digital assistant that connects to devices in the home. All these companies are chasing the smart-home market, which could grow to be a $71 billion global industry by 2018, up from $33 billion in 2013 and $25 billion in 2012, according to Juniper Research. That’s growing fast, although it’s still much smaller than the smartphone market, which the research firm IDC valued at about $412 billion in 2015. But while the Echo carved out an early success, it remains to be seen whether voice-recognition smart speakers will truly break into the mainstream. “They’re early, (but) the market is early, and we have a long way to go,” said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner. Learning new skills One key to the Echo’s success was Amazon’s willingness to work with third-party developers, allowing it to add new functions each week, making it easy for owners of the speaker to discover new ways to use it. (It launched with a few dozen “skills” and now has thousands). “Initially we got it for music,” said Brian Bishop, a business analyst in Tomball, Texas, whose family uses two Echos. “Later, when it controlled the lights and fans and outlets, that just made it even better.” Interest in smart homes appears to be rising as more people become enamored of their smartphones. A recent online survey of more than 4,600 adults in the U.S. by Forrester Research’s Technographics found 57 percent of them either had used or were interested in using a smart home device such as remote control lights or thermostats. The Echo’s hands-free operation filled an undiscovered niche in the smart-home universe. Users can just say the wake word “Alexa” and direct it to do a task like turn on lights or set a timer. Since you don’t need to use a smartphone or tablet, that sets it apart from other smart home systems like those offered by Samsung or Apple. Speak to me People seem to have an easier time talking to a speaker that has no other interface than they do talking to a smartphone. “I’ve never used Cortana. I don’t use Google and my wife doesn’t use Siri, but everybody talks to Alexa,” Bishop said. “I couldn’t really tell you why. That was the only way to communicate, so we all got in the habit.” Buck Wise, a Portland advertising executive, tried several variants of smart home systems, but said the Echo worked best for him because of the hands-free speaker. He has lights, blinds, and his garage door synced with the Echo. “Alexa truly is the brain of our home and it would feel like 100 steps backwards to get through a day without her,” Wise said. What won him over? Commanding the device just by speaking — and without having to fire up an app — basically did the trick, he said. Big ambitions Google has catching up to do. Amazon first hinted at its Echo ambitions in a Super Bowl ad featuring Alec Baldwin and seen by more than 100 million people. Beginning in April, the Echo went on sale at retail outlets including Best Buy, Home Depot, electronics stores such as RadioShack and others. The same month, Amazon opened up its smart home capabilities to let all developers of smart home functions integrate with Alexa. It’s also launched two other Echo-like devices, the smaller $50 Dot — which it now sells in six-packs so people can have one in every room — and the portable $100 Tap, to give Alexa even broader reach. Dave Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president for devices, says the goal is for Alexa to keep getting smarter as it continues to build new “skills” over the coming years. “The hope is you can ask Alexa anything and it will be able to respond correctly, quickly and be able to be there,” he said.

Well, many marketers are still looking for the right washer/dryer combo for cleaning those clothes. Just like a super appliance store can be full of washers and dryers, the marketplace is full of different tools for combining data, from Microsoft BI to dashboard solutions like Tableau. Google has offered its own data appliance in the form of Data Studio. The solution was first introduced as part of the Google Analytics 360 Suite, the premium version of Google Analytics aimed at enterprise-level reporting needs. But Google decided to introduce a beta version to complement not only its standard analytics solution but for other purposes. The result is now another appliance that offers a central repository for data and report-building. Data Studio offers the ability to combine data from many sources, including AdWords, Google Analytics, Big Query, and Google Sheets. There's provision for SQL database sources as well.  How Data Studio Works  Once logged in, you are taken to a home page that has a layout familiar from other Google services. This means a user experience with large, tablet-friendly selectors and menus that group features by function. There is also a video help selection, to allow you to see how features work via YouTube. If you are ready to start, begin with the Reports and Data Sources selectors in the upper left-hand corner. The Reports selector permits you to create reports and data visualizations. Sample reports are presented immediately in the home page so you can see the range of ideas that you can have for reports. You can copy a demo report, or create your own. The Data Sources selector is meant, obviously, to add the data sources. Once selected, data appears as a schema table on the home page. Like Reports, there are also sample schemata that serve as a guidance for ideas, such as this Adwords example. You can then confirm that you want to add the schema to a report and select the visualization that you want. Visualization choices appear on a bar at the top of the page. Source, dimension, metric, and appearance style appear on the right, allowing adjustments, such as changing a chart scale. Most of the visualization has a drag and drop feel, and can be adjusted as needed. How Data Studios Benefits Data Mining Marketers Data Studio is meant to address a growing complaint among data-savvy analysts who have to offer guidance to time-crunched managers; namely, that the majority of their time is spent on data management tasks rather than analysis. It's a refrain that has worn out its welcome, particularly with the advent of data mining. Through tools like Data Studio, managers are discovering real business value from blending data from different sources and improving reporting plans. Data mining activities foreshadow a wide variety of model creation, ranging from regression to machine learning, thus shifting time available towards analysis rather than setup. To provide that resource shift, Data Studio treats its data sources as reusable components. Users can reuse connections in various reports, and in different combinations within the same page. The sources do not have to be hardcoded in visualization, making maintenance updates easier and quicker. Reusable code is a central concept to R programming. Reusability allows R programmers to recreate models fasters, and allow other programmers to verify models through duplicate the process in creating those results. Verification is a key tenet data mining, and scientific research generally. With Data Studio, enterprises can experiment with how to best use the data available alongside familiar tools. A number of solutions can export data into Google Sheets, and Data Studio Product Manager Nikhil Roy has said that Data Studio was intended as a complement to Google Sheets. Whether data mining or developing dashboards, marketers need to quickly share information with other teams. The ease of doing so has been enhanced with Google Data Studio. Loading links....

Google Duo is taking Hangouts’ place on Android The Verge 10/8/2016 Nick Statt © Provided by The Verge In its ongoing effort to push new chat software, Google won't require Android phone makers to preload the Hangouts app as part of its core mobile app suite starting December 1st, according to Android Police. In its place, the company will instead include Duo, its recently released FaceTime competitor for instant video chatting. Hangouts isn't totally going away. It will remain an optional member of the Google Mobile Services package, which Google requires manufacturers to install so consumers have integral services like the Chrome browser and Google Maps. However, the demotion means Hangouts will have significantly less visibility among new phone buyers if companies do decide to leave it out. This does not mean manufacturers will decide to leave Hangouts wallowing in the Play Store. The app could very well make its way onto Android handsets for many months to come. And the app will be available for download even if it is left out of the GMS suite — that is until Google decides to shutter it. Still, the move is a telling one from the search giant, which has moved aggressively to promote Duo and its new artificial intelligence-powered chat app Allo. It's a bit of a strange move that Allo won't be a mandatory app in the GMS suite, as Android Police points out, but it could be included down the line. Right now, it's clear Google wants to promote video chatting above all else.

Watch: Google Pixel XL First Look Video Google’s launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency.

Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel.

By Chris Barraclough 7th Oct 2016 Features Sony Xperia X Series Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones Tweet We compare the new 'made by Google' Pixel phone, with Sony's 2016 flagship mobile the Xperia XZ. What's the difference in terms of specs, camera tech and other features, and which one is best for you? Here's our Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ comparison review. Just this week, Google pulled back the curtain on its 5-inch flagship Pixel phone, packing premium specs for a super-premium price. The Pixel boasts a sharp and colourful Full HD screen, the latest Snapdragon processor and a powerful 12-megapixel camera, but it's also just as expensive as other flagship phones like Apple's iPhone 7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7. So how does the Pixel compare with Sony's Xperia XZ, another super-powered Android handset that just hit the UK last month? Here's our full Pixel vs Xperia XZ comparison review to help you decide. And have a gander at our full hands-on review of the 5-inch Pixel phone, to learn more. Check out our hands-on Pixel XL review too, where we share our first thoughts on the super-sized 5.5-inch version of the Pixel phone. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Specs at a glance Phone Google Pixel Sony Xperia XZ Screen size 5-inches 5.2-inches Screen resolution Full HD 1920x1080 Full HD 1920x1080 Weight 143g 161g Fingerprint sensor? Yes Yes Water resistant? No Yes OS Android 7.1 Nougat Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow Processor Snapdragon 821 Snapdragon 820 Memory 4GB 4GB Storage 32/128GB 32/64GB MicroSD? No Yes Battery 2770mAh 2900mAh Rear camera 12-megapixel 23-megapixel Front camera 8-megapixel 13-megapixel Price From £599 From £500 Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Design Sony's Xperia XZ is a proper hand-filler, although just about usable one-handed. Those rounded edges makes it quite comfortable to hold, while the matte metallic surfacing gives an attractive finish in a selection of shades. It's not impervious to scratches sadly, although these are difficult to see unless the light catches the phone just right. Google's Pixel phone is more compact and a little lighter too, with a slender design that's well suited to one-handed use. Around the back you'll find an unusual blend of glass and metal, which certainly stands out from the rest of the smartphone crowd. It feels quite hardy but we'll be testing that out when we use the Pixel phone as our full-time handset. The Pixel phone isn't water resistant, unlike the Xperia XZ, so you probably shouldn't check your Twitter feed in the bath or anything. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Screen and media Both the Pixel phone and the HTC 10 sport a sharp Full HD screen, which means you'll struggle to make out individual pixels. With either handset you get rich colours that really pop and bring images to life. And both phones will be easy to use in harsh sunlight, thanks to those powerful brightness levels. Sony's Xperia XZ also supports Hi-Res audio when your plug in headphones, for a super-detailed musical experience. In our brief play, the Pixel phone didn't seem to offer the same support. The Pixel phone also doesn't have a microSD memory card slot so you can't expand the on-board storage. Although there is a 128GB model, if you've got £699 hanging around in your wallet. Thankfully the XZ does support microSD, so you can fill up a massive card with loads of movies and more. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: OS and features Sony's Xperia XZ still uses Android Marshmallow, which was released last year, just like every other flagship Android from 2016. But the Pixel phone comes with the latest Android Nougat pre-installed - no surprise, as this is a 'made by Google' mobile. This gives you Google's new Assistant AI straight out of the box, which is basically a step beyond Google Now with its context-aware helpfulness. Of course, the Xperia XZ should get an update to full Nougat soon, but you won't get the Assistant feature because Google is saving that for Pixel handsets alone. Bums. The good news for gamers is that the Xperia XZ does support Remote Play, which means you can stream your PS4 gaming sessions straight to your phone. You can even pair your PS4 controller, with zero latency to spoil the show. Both phones pack a fingerprint sensor, to quickly and securely unlock to your desktops. On the Xperia XZ this is mounted on the edge, while the Pixel phone's is stuck around the back. Both are easy and intuitive to use. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Performance and battery life Gamers and media fans will enjoy a smooth everyday performance from the Xperia XZ, thanks to the Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM stuffed inside. We're not expecting to see any sign of slowdown any time soon. That said, the new Pixel phone uses the latest Snapdragon 821 processor, which promises a ten percent increase in performance over the old 820 chipset. In terms of real-life experience, there's unlikely to be any real difference between these two mobiles, at least for some time - but in a year or two, the Pixel may be the smoother operator of these two. As for battery life, the Xperia XZ gives you at least a day of heavy use per charge. And of course it supports fast charging, to get you powered up and ready to rock in no time at all. We're yet to test the Pixel phone's battery life, but early word is that the Pixel can keep going for even longer. Fast charging is again supported, while both handsets use Type-C USB for power and data transfer. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Cameras When we get our review sample of the Pixel phone we'll be thoroughly testing the 12-megapixel rear camera, but in our hands-on tests it certainly seems to be a worthy flagship snapper. You can take rapid-fire shots and there's zero shutter lag, just like on the iPhone 7's excellent camera. Just tap and your photo takes instantly. Our test photos were pleasingly detailed, although unlikely to beat the Xperia XZ's output. Sony's 23-megapixel camera really impresses with its sharp, attractive images, and the XZ's new triple-sensor tech works well in low-light conditions. Check out our in-depth Xperia XZ camera review for full samples and more. Both of these phones can capture up to 4K resolution video, with strong image stabilisation to cut down on shakes and judders. If you shoot a lot of home movies, you don't need to lean towards one phone or the other. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Price and verdict When it comes to cost, the Xperia XZ and Google Pixel phone both pack a premium price. However, it's possible to pick up the Xperia XZ on contract for less cash than the Pixel, and in terms of specs and features there's not a massive gap between them. You can grab the Sony Xperia XZ from O2, from £37 per month with no up-front cost. Check out our round-up of the best Pixel phone UK deals. Stay tuned for our full Google Pixel phone review.

On the bright side, Google will deliver the monthly Android security updates itself.  ( Verizon Wireless ) Advertisement Surprise! Buying a Google Pixel smartphone from Verizon Wireless means that Big Red has final say when it comes to delivering Android updates. Those who purchase a new Google Pixel smartphone unlocked from the Google Store will get their future Android updates straight from Google, just how it worked with Nexus devices. The Verizon Pixel models, however, are carrier versions and updates are left to the carrier. It's worth mentioning that the same applies to Verizon Pixel smartphones purchase from Best Buy, since the retailer is not carrying the unlocked versions of the handsets. Google itself has confirmed to 9to5Google that Verizon will be responsible for delivering future Android updates to the Google Pixel smartphones that it sells. This means that it will likely take a while for future updates to hit the devices. Any intermediary between Google and Google device users typically results in delays, and carriers conduct their own testing processes before delivering updates. Verizon, for its part, is notorious for delivering updates late, which means that Google Pixel owners may not get the latest updates as soon as they're available. On the bright side, Google retains control of security. The company will be in charge of delivering the monthly Android security updates directly to its smartphones, be they Verizon versions or unlocked models. Meanwhile, those who would like to avoid Android update delays might want to consider purchasing a Google Pixel or Pixel XL directly from the Google Store. They're fully compatible with Verizon's network and might save you some headaches down the line, when new updates hit the scene. As a bonus, Pixel smartphones purchased from Google will not come with Verizon's own bloatware preinstalled - and Big Red tends to stuff its devices full of preloaded applications. That may not change the fact that most people prefer to buy smartphones from carriers, but at least it serves as a heads-up. Verizon is the exclusive carrier partner for the Google Pixel smartphones, but interested customers can always opt for the unlocked version instead. If you're not sure which Google Pixel smartphone might be the right fit for you, check out our Google Pixel vs. Pixel XL comparison. The two smartphones will officially go on sale in November, but both are already available for preorder. To further sweeten the deal, both the Google Pixel and the Pixel XL come with a free Daydream VR headset, as they're the first smartphones to be Daydream-ready.

X Cantillon: Meet Hal, your 21st-century personal assistant Smart home devices from Google and Amazon requires users to sacrifice a lot of privacy Sat, Oct 8, 2016, 05:29 2001: A Space Odyssey – either science fiction, or an uncannily prescient look at AI-powered devices that know far more about us than they should         For anyone old enough to remember 2001: A Space Odyssey, now might be the time to reconsider moving to that cabin in the woods, with no phone connection or electricity. Because your home is about to become almost sentient, thanks to the combined efforts of Google and Amazon. We’re about to throw open the doors of our homes to devices that can control everything around us, and we don’t seem to be that concerned about the power it gives away. Both companies now offer voice-controlled speakers that can take control over the basic smart home functions. But Google has the potential to make it just a little creepier. We’ll give the firm the benefit of the doubt. We’re sure it’s not the company’s intention to know a scary amount of detail about its users’ lives. But it does. Where you live, where you work, what your voice sounds like. What spam lists you’ve been signed up to. Every place you’ve asked for directions to since you started signing in to Google maps. And now, add Google Home to the mix. Google Home uses artifical intelligence – Google Assistant – to learn about users: what they like and dislike, what they need at different types of the day. It could either be the best friend you’ll ever have, or a slightly creepy, stalkerish device that knows far more about you than it should. But this isn’t just about Google Home; it’s merely the latest in a long line of products that are designed to make our homes smarter by connecting them to the internet. It’s all part of the internet of things, the march towards connecting devices online in a bid to make them more useful, more convenient and take a lot of the dull, repetitive work away from humans. It all sounds like a great idea. But it’s not as simple as that. There’s a sinister side to the internet of things. Take the recent attack on security writer Brian Krebs’ website. It was the biggest DDOS attack ever recorded, with the attackers using a web of IoT devices to carry it out. A report on the incident blamed security cameras and DVRs with basic passwords for the attack. ADVERTISEMENT Basic passwords, in this instance, meant ones that were never changed from the easily guessed default, or were something simple like “password” or “admin”. At the end of the day, the smart home and all its devices is only as smart as the person using it. The weak link in the chain is the human element – and that’s one that we may not be able to fix for the forseeable future.       Topics: Cantillon Brian Krebs Amazon Google AboutCantillon A man with a profound understanding of how money is made and lost, Kerry-born economist Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734) is a fitting namesake for this long-running column.

Secondary Menu Home About Categories bbPress Blogging BuddyPress Events ICYMI News Plugins Polls Themes WordPress Weekly WordPress Contributors Podcast Comment Policy Contact Us Search for: Home News WordPress.com Adds Customization for AMP Pages, Pushes Update to AMP Plugin WordPress.com Adds Customization for AMP Pages, Pushes Update to AMP Plugin Sarah Gooding October 7, 2016 4 When Google first launched AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages), its open source initiative to speed up the mobile web, the project focused on getting publishers on board. AMP pages were featured in the “Top Stories” carousel and soon adoption of AMP grew beyond news publishers to other industries such as e-commerce, recipe sites, and local listings. Ebay has AMP’d up 15 million product category pages, Pinterest is getting ready to roll out AMP support for pins, and Reddit is also serving AMP pages. At the end of Septemeber Google announced that it has added AMP indicators to mobile search results. Users can now easily tell which results will load faster than others by looking for the AMP lightning bolt icon. The pressure is on for website owners to make their sites AMP-ready. Google said that AMP results are not yet prioritized over others, but page speed is factored into results. The search engine’s benchmarks demonstrate that AMP results provide a much faster experience for mobile users than pages that have not been optimized according to AMP specifications: Today, the median time it takes for an AMP page to load from Google Search is less than one second. Beyond just saving you time with fast loading pages, AMP will also save you data — AMP pages on Search use 10 times less data than the equivalent non-AMP page. In response with Google AMPing up mobile search results, WordPress.com has pushed out a major update to its support for AMP pages. According to Automattic representative Mark Armstrong, AMP pages have been “automatically turned on for every WordPress.com site and a sizable number of VIP publishers also turned it on manually.” This means that tens of millions of sites are now, according to Automattic’s tests, “up to 89% faster than normal faster” when reached via mobile search. The update also gives WordPress.com users the ability to customize the design for AMP pages using live preview in the Customizer. Users can select between a light and dark color screen and use a color-picker to select header text and link colors. Automattic’s AMP plugin for self-hosted WordPress users has been updated to include support for tweaking the AMP template in the Customizer by navigating to Appearance > AMP. The plugin, which has more than 90,000 active installs, had not been updated for the past two months until today. During that time it accumulated many negative reviews due to lack of customizability, bugs, and no support for pages. Several users have reported that Google sent them a notification saying the AMP pages automatically created by the plugin are not compliant. The AMP plugin’s changelog details the changes in 0.4, which include support for inline styles, a fix for broken YouTube URLs, no more fatal errors when tags are not supported by post type, and handful of other improvements. The release also introduces a new filter amp_pre_get_permalink for creating a custom AMP permalink. Pages are still not supported, but the plugin’s FAQ tab indicates that Automattic is working on it.

In a move that truly highlights the death of the Nexus program, system updates for the Pixel phones will be managed by Verizon for models that it sells, while Google will handle updates for unlocked models purchased through the Google Store. Phones bought at Best Buy are Verizon models, so they will be subject to Verizon's update schedule too. With Nexus devices, Google controlled the delivery of software updates, whether it was sold by a carrier or not. This ensured that anyone who purchased a Nexus device was treated to fast software updates when a new version of Android was released. However, with Verizon controlling updates for its Pixel phones, the carrier will almost certainly delay the rollout of updates to ensure their bloatware is fully compatible. On a positive note, Google will still push monthly security updates to the Pixel and Pixel XL outside of Verizon's control, ensuring users have a secure device at all times. Verizon only has control over system updates, such as a potential future update to Android 8.0 when it's announced and released. For those that want a Pixel phone on Verizon and don't want to deal with the carrier's slow updates and bloatware, the models Google are selling through the Google Store are fully compatible with the Verizon network. It's possible to simply buy the handset from Google, rather than Verizon, and enjoy a Nexus-like software experience.

The tech conglomerate has been powering smartphones, driverless cars, and even homes. V Geetanath » B Rishikesh Bahadurdesai » Zahid Rafiq » VIDEO   The best of Google I/O Here’s what’s new with the conglomerate: two new smartphones with loads of new specs, a voice-activated assistant and more technological marvels It’s hard to imagine a world without Google, even though many of us have lived in a world before that search field redefined how we use the Internet. Now Google is diversifying, spreading out into every aspect of our lives. The tech conglomerate has been powering smartphones, driverless cars, and even homes. This year, though, the search giant made a huge move, laying to rest the Nexus name and introducing their own phones: the Pixel and Pixel XL. While these were the stars of Google’s reveal, the real star is the one you didn’t know you saw. It’s the Google Assistant, an AI that’s right there on your phone. In the months leading up to the launch, a normal Google search of the Pixel and Pixel XL yielded hundreds of leaks. We knew what was coming, and how it looked, so there was no surprise there. However, it’s been an entirely different feeling to look at the actual finished product. Let’s take a closer look at the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. What’s Outside The Pixel and its bigger brother, Pixel XL, are beautifully designed with an aerospace-grade aluminium unibody. What makes them stand out from all other phones is a glass section at the back with the fingerprint sensor, giving the phone a lot of personality. The Pixel has a 5-inch full HD AMOLED display, while the Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch Quad HD (four times the definition of standard display) AMOLED display, with a 100 per cent NTSC colour gamut and true black levels. The glass on the front of the display is 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The phone comes in what Google clearly means to be a jibe at the iPhone colour variant names — Quite Black and Very White colours, along with a special edition Really Blue, which, incidentally, is already sold out. The front of the phone sports an array of sensors that are unsightly, especially on the white phone. So the Quite Black is what you should be going for if you don’t like seeing those sensors. The bezels are decent on the sides, not too small, not too big. However, the ‘chin’ of the phone is quite big; a space which would normally have been used for hardware buttons or a fingerprint sensor, or even stereo speakers, is now empty real estate. In another dig at rival Apple, Google showed off their inclusion of the headphone jack. The Cameras Yes, this is the only part of a smartphone anyone ever cares about nowadays, and with good measure. Smartphone manufacturers have realised the importance of a good camera and are racing to build the best. However, Google seems to have beaten both Apple and Samsung to the click, by claiming that the Pixel has the best camera to date. According to DXOMark, a site that reviews and rates camera tech, the Pixel has scored the highest among smartphones with 89 points. But we will know for sure in the next few days, when the user reviews start pouring in. For now, let’s see the specs. The rear camera is a 12.3-megapixel shooter with large 1.55 micron pixels that capture more light, resulting in a better picture. The F2.0 aperture lets in more light with a phase and laser detection autofocus. This camera can record a full HD video at 60 fps (frames per second) and slow motion at 120 fps, 4K video at 30 fps, and very slowmo video at 240 fps at a slightly lower 720p. Google has mentioned that its camera software is bristling with algorithms that help get you the best picture. You can even hold the shutter button down to burst shoot, and the phone will help you select the best shot and save it in the album. The front camera is an eight-megapixel, fixed-focus shooter, also with large 1.4 micron pixels. This allows you to take great selfies — again using Google’s camera app — with a load of enhancements. While both shooters may take excellent pictures, they will take up a lot of space on your phone. Especially considering that there’s no SD Card support. Google did reveal, though, that every Pixel user will get free unlimited storage on the cloud for all their photos and videos, no matter the resolution or file size. What’s Inside The Pixel and Pixel XL both sport the latest Snapdragon 821 processors. Storage comes in between 32GB to 128GB, non-expandable, so you’ll be glad there’s free unlimited photo and video storage. To keep things running smooth, there’s a 4GB LPDDR4 RAM. The phone comes with a USB Type-C connector and a large 2770mAh battery for the Pixel, and an even larger 3450mAh battery for the Pixel XL. According to Google, you can get seven hours of use with just a quick 15 minutes of charging. The Price This is where the catch comes in. Google has confirmed the Pixel’s price to be Rs. 57,000 for the 32GB variant and Rs. 66,000 for the 128GB variant. The Pixel XL starts at Rs. 67,000 for the 32GB variant and Rs. 76,000 for the 128GB variant. The prices are almost at the iPhone 7 level for specs that are around the area of the OnePlus 3, which will set you back Rs. 27,999. Though it seems that the Pixels are packing a little bit more than just stock Android. Google Assistant We’ve always dreamed of robots and other forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) helping us live better. Science fiction has always portrayed them as destroyers of life thanks to movies like Terminator, and worse yet, AI can go crazy as seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey or Avengers: Age of Ultron. The best examples of good AI would be those in Interstellar, which are true buddies to man in every respect. We are years away from that kind of tech, but the first step towards that reality is the Pixel. Meet Google Assistant, a friendly AI that uses conversational English to help you with whatever you need. Google actually understands and responds accordingly, to context like “should I wear sunglasses today”, in response to which the Assistant shows you the weather. Should you ask about tomorrow, the Assistant already knows what you’re referring to and will show you what the next day looks like. The Assistant was also shown taking notes and reminders when simply asked to remember something. You can also get it to bring up images from an earlier date or translate for you. Why is this so important? The easiest form of interaction is with speech. With any other smartphone, you’d have to manually look for a particular image, physically type out a note or have a translation app. With the Assistant, you can constantly ask it to keep track of your life. This paves the way for a completely voice-activated future. Google Chromecast Ultra Google’s little streaming device has gained quite a lot of ground all over the world. It converts any screen into a Smart TV easily and lets you stream movies. With 4K and HDR gaining ground, the Chromecast Ultra makes that upgrade to a TV with both features seem a lot more appealing. Essentially, 4K is very high fidelity content while HDRs (High Dynamic Range) are better types of screens with better display technology to give you very lifelike quality with amazing contrast ratio. These two technologies are the biggest reasons to upgrade to a 4K/HDR TV. Google Daydream VR Interestingly, Google was the first to unveil a true virtual reality device, which was made of cardboard and aptly called Cardboard. It was the perfect VR solution since you only needed a good smartphone and a Cardboard unit you could practically make yourself. Now, Google has introduced Daydream VR, a lightweight fabric VR device that holds your smartphone screen at a distance from your eyes. It also packs in a tiny controller unit so you can adjust your experience. Just be careful not to bump your knees into a table, or fall off a balcony. Google home Also unveiled at Google’s press event was a voice-controlled speaker called Google Home. Essentially, this uses the power of Google Assistant to control aspects of your home. The Assistant is always there to answer several of your queries and pipe reminders about flights and other time-bound activities.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise How Voice Search Will Forever Change SEO SEO 101 June 14, 2016 SEO 101 Aleh BarysevichJune 14, 2016 2.1KSHARES 6.2KREADS 2.1KSHARES 6.2KREADS Aleh Barysevich 2.1KSHARES 6.2KREADS When Star Trek: The Next Generation aired in 1987, having a casual conversation with a computer must have seemed like far-flung science fiction. But according to the state of voice search, we won’t have to wait until the year 2364 to get there. Voice search is the fastest growing type of search, according to the keynote speech given by Behshad Behzadi at SMX West in March, Principal Engineer at Google Zurich. Already, 55% of teens and 41% of adults use voice search on a daily basis, and that number is only growing. The allure of voice chat is undeniable—it’s faster, it’s hands-free, it lets you multi-task, and (especially among millennials) it’s considered cool. Voice chat is also becoming increasingly reliable as technology improves. In fact, two years ago word error rate was over 20%, but current speech recognition word error rate is as low as 8%—a huge leap in a short amount of time. And now, according to Behshad, conversational search is the future. Not just voice recognition, but voice understanding—search that responds to natural phrases by interpreting the meaning and context behind the words used. Google’s aim is to transform voice search into “an ultimate mobile assistant that helps you with your daily life, so you can focus on the things that matter.” Search Smarter Than Ever Before Very few people type the way they speak, especially when it comes to search queries. When you type, you adopt a sort of stilted shorthand, so you enter something like “weather Paris” into your search bar. When you speak, you’re more likely to ask the complete question, “What’s the weather like in Paris?” This pattern holds true with voice search queries as well. As programs like Google Now, Siri, and Cortana become more popular, and their programming becomes more refined, it’s increasingly important that search engines learn to interpret natural phrases. To that end, Google’s been trying to adopt speech quirks and idiosyncrasies into its voice search programming. And they’ve been busy. Voice search is now capable of interpreting and responding to: 1. Spelling Corrections/Queries If you ask Google to show you a picture of Wales, and you get back a picture of whales, you can then clarify, “W-A-L-E-S,” and a picture of the country will now pop up. 2. What’s Been Previously Said/Searched For If you ask “Where is the Golden Gate Bridge” and follow that up with the queries “I want to see pictures of it” and “who built it,” Google is able to interpret what “it” is based on your initial search, delivering pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge and an answer on who built it. Alternatively, if Google cannot immediately answer a query, you can help it narrow down the answer through context. So, if you ask “How high is Rigi,” voice search may not respond, because it’s an obscure mountain in the Swiss Alps. But if you ask, “What are the mountains in Switzerland” first, and follow that up with the query “How high is Rigi,” Google will tell you that it’s 1,798 m in elevation. 3. Context Based on Location If you’re at a Convention Center in San Jose and you ask voice search, “How far is the airport from the Convention Center?” Google will understand that “the Convention Center” refers to your current location in San Jose. 4. App-Based Context If you’re chatting about a specific restaurant in an app like Viber, you can ask Google to “Show me the menu.” Google will understand which restaurant’s menu you want to see based on context, and bring up a menu for that restaurant. 5. Context of What You See On-screen Looking up a Wikipedia entry on Johnny Depp? You can ask voice search to “Show me pictures of Johnny,” and get back a smorgasbord of Johnny Depp photos, because he’s the “Johnny” you currently have on screen. 6. Context About You Asking Google “What’s my office address?” will bring up your office address, without the need to clarify who “my” refers to. But that’s not all! There are also hints that Google is working on conversational shopping. It’s not hard to imagine how this could lend itself to making instant purchases, asking voice search to “Order me a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza from Pizza Hut” or “Show me blue jeans / Show me size 12 / Order me the pair from American Eagle.” The Death of Short Tail Keywords? It’s clear that context and conversational search are only to become more important as voice search continues to evolve. So where does that leave SEO? Well, for one thing, we need to seriously incorporate voice search strategy into our websites, because voice search optimization is the future of SEO. That means doubling down on excellent content, written in a conversational tone. We also need to understand that people who type a query and people who ask a question into voice search are often after two different things entirely. For example, the typer might be okay with doing research, while the talker typically wants quick answers and instant results. We need to appeal to both types of people. When it comes to optimization strategies, you should: 1. Focus on Long Tail Keywords While I don’t believe that short tail keywords will ever disappear entirely, they do become far less relevant when we consider the natural phrases used in voice searches. We need to focus more attention than ever on conversational, long tail keywords. 2. Provide Context with Schema Markup Get acquainted with schema markup, if you’re not already. This HTML add-on helps search engines understand the context of your content, which means you rank better in normal searches, and you’ll be more relevant in specific queries made through voice search. 3. Optimize Your Site’s Microdata Make sure things like directions to brick and mortar locations and XML Sitemaps are readable to visitors and search engines on your website. This is the kind of information mobile users and voice searchers will most often be after. 4. Add Pages That Answer FAQs When voice searchers as a question, they typically begin it with “Who,” “What,” “Where,” “When,” “Why,” and “How,” and they’re looking for answers that fulfill an immediate need. To answer these queries, make a FAQs page and begin each question with these adverbs. Then answer them conversationally to appeal to voice search. 5. Do Keyword Research on Conversational Queries Keyword research tools like Rank Tracker (disclaimer: my tool) will let you autocomplete queries using a keyword and a wildcard. Base the questions on the FAQs described above and look for commonly searched long tail keywords to figure out what questions you should be answering. Where We Go From Here I think a lot of us who grew up in an age where technology couldn’t talk back still have a certain stigma attached to talking to our phones when another human being isn’t on the other end. But, according to Google, younger generations don’t have that same hesitation, and most “feel tech savvy” asking questions into voice search. They ask it for directions. They use it to call someone. It even helps them with their homework. And yes, they even use it in the company of others. Voice search is clearly on the rise and we’d be foolish to ignore this trend in the SEO industry. It’s time to stop thinking linearly about only text-based queries, and start talking about how we can optimize for voice searches as well. Clearly, the future is conversational.   Image Credits Featured image: Alexander Supertramp/Shutterstock.com In-post Photo: Ollyy / Shutterstock.com Related Posts These 7 New AdWords Tools and Features Will Change Your Campaigns Forever 20 Ways Google Glass Will Change Pro Sports Forever Voice Search SEO: Is Hands Free Search a Hands Down Winner?

Great article must say.. (y) Palash Kumar Daw Thank’s Trifon Boyukliyski google voice search features Caroline Wabara Great insights! Got to know the power of voice search when my 8 year old son prefers speaking rather than typing the words. Feuza Reis love the post as last year I began noticing my young kids using voice search and how the future of search will be long tail keywords but what I did not realize is how action based queries will be and future will be instead of pizza near me, will be order me a small pie etc, and how different the typer is vs the one using voice results- love that part Aleh Barysevich Agree – we’re stepping into an exciting stage of optimizing for voice search, along with all the other traditional aspects of SEO. Site owners will need to better understand how people reference their business when speaking, the exact words they’re likely to use. In addition, to win in voice search, sites will need to be fast and mobile-friendly. Feuza Reis yes they will be and future is intriguing Anthony Trollope Rather astounding stats. 8% error rate doesn’t seem to match my personal experiences. I tend to get quite frustrated with it. Admittedly I’m not compared Apples with Apples, as I mostly use Siri which one assumes is not as proficient as Google Voice Search. Aleh Barysevich I know, 8% error rate in speech recognition sounds like a huge improvement to what we’re used to. The stats were announced by a Google representative at a conference back in March, so it’s quite recent and based on their latest technology improvements. Google Voice Search should indeed be more superior to Siri. Dhivya Subramanian Thanks for sharing optimization strategy……how u made this ?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Everything you need to know from Google’s Oct. 4 Event By John Hoff - October 7, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter So yeah, you’ve probably heard about Google’s new phones by now – that is, if you didn’t live under a rock for the past 3 days. From the October 4 press event held at Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco, Google made its intentions known to the world that apart from its monopoly of the internet search market, it now wants to be a true-blue hardware manufacturer. They announced a slew of new hardware (and software) for everyone to enjoy, and here are the highlights, in case you missed it. Google Pixel and Pixel XL No doubt the stars of the show, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones feature Google’s latest and greatest version of its mobile OS – Android 7.1 Nougat — a top-notch camera, quick charging, and some newfangled digital assistant, as well as the expected platform for virtual reality. The hardware was put together by HTC, but the whole process of design and manufacturing was all Google at this point. The two new phones will take over from the Nexus brand line, and they basically look the same when compared to each other. The Pixel XL is the larger of the two with a 5.5-inch AMOLED display compared to standard Pixel’s 5-inches. They are powered by Qualcomm’s latest and fastest silicon in the market, the Snapdragon 821 and supported by 4GB RAM. The camera is already dubbed as the best camera ever put on a smartphone so far, and with the new features on Android 7.1 that are Pixel exclusives, the phone is a legitimate contender in the flagship device market. The pricing starts at USD$649, and this is an obvious departure from the balance between features and affordability that the Nexus line had. These are clearly high-end phones, and Google plans to market them as such. Google Assistant With the hardware of the Pixel phones robust as can be, it is notable that the more convincing arguments to get the phone still lie in the software area. One big part of that is the Google Assistant AI and digital voice assist platform. Google started with Google Now on Android, but Google Assistant looks leagues better than what we’ve been used to. Google Assistant uses contextual learning and is able to recognize conversational patterns in the way you communicate to it, and so it is able to give you more targeted information. It is embedded not only into the Pixel phones, but to the Google Home as well (more on this later), so that it can give you another option as far as Amazon’s Alexa is concerned. But the really amazing thing about Google Assistant is how conversational it is, how it is able to understand natural speech patterns, and how embedded it is into the Google experience. Google Home Speaking of Google Home, we find this piece of new hardware from Google to be quite close to the Pixel smartphones in terms of importance. Google Home is basically Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo, and as mentioned, it also has Google Assistant embedded. The device will look right at home in your living room, and you can access it with voice commands to do things like Google searches, get information from your Google account apps and services, and even control your smart home. Google Home is small and unobtrusive, white at the top with different color options in fabric and metal for the bottom part. There’s a touch capacitive top, which allows for manual controls, and a mute button when you don’t want Google listening in to your life. At USD$130, this could be a steal. Chromecast Ultra Google also offered a refresh of its Chromecast streaming device – calling this new iteration the Chromecast Ultra. It brings with it what you probably would expect from a streaming device in this day –4K video streaming, support for HDR, and you even get an Ethernet port so that you get enough bandwith if you want to stream in 4K resolution. Unfortunately, you will not get the same USD$35 price tag as the previous two iterations of the Chromecast. The bump in features also doubles the price – the Chromecast Ultra will be available later in the year for USD$70. Daydream View VR headset One of the surprises of the event was Google presenting a gorgeously manufactured virtual reality (VR) headset – this one is called Daydream View, alluding of course to the Daydream VR platform they were launching for Android Nougat. The new VR headset is obviously communicating with its fabric-wrapped build that it is very comfortable to wear. At the moment, it’s currently available only for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. The concept is the same with other device-powered VR headsets – you slide on your phone, snap it on, and it’s ready to go. The headset comes with its own VR remote and will be available later in the year – probably in time for the holidays – for around USD$79.00. Google is currently pushing a promo where you can get a coupon for a free headset if you purchase the Pixel smartphone from the Google Play Store. Google Wifi Another addition into your living area – apart from Google Home – is a sleek and round new network router from the mothership called Google Wifi. As with new routers these days, Google Wifi is a smart router that includes software which tries to maintaining a decent speed for connected devices no matter how many of them there are. There’s a “Network Assist” feature which automatically helps avoid network congestion. Buy around three of these for your home and the software automatically transitions your connected device to the nearest one to ensure you have the best possible signal. Predictably, Google made an app for the router. This gives you monitoring information and control for the devices on the network. You can actually kick your kids off the network if you want them to come to dinner, which is pretty helpful. Google Wifi, as with most of the hardware here, will be available later in the year – buy a single unit for USD$130, or a three-pack for USD$300 if you have a large house. WHEW! There you go. Are you convinced that Google is up for the hardware part of the market? From current evidence, it looks like they’re going to give it a good try at the very least. And you have to say, those are some good looking pieces of hardware right there.

(Handout/Google) Google has announced a new line of smartphones, which it’s calling the Pixel. (Handout/Google) It’s easy to imagine a future in which products as mundane as toasters and window blinds will be connected to the internet and controlled by software. It’s harder to guess who’s going to make them. Leading producers of consumer software such as Google, Facebook, Amazon.com and Snapchat are branching into designing physical goods at accelerating rates. Driven by intensifying competition for consumer attention and enabled by declining manufacturing costs, software companies are entering battle with firms as far-removed from Silicon Valley as Timex and Ray-Ban. The years to come could see Amazon making bookshelves that know what’s on them, grocery delivery app Instacart peddling refrigerators that restock on their own and music-streaming service Spotify designing headphones with a cellular chip and flip-down video display. It’s all conjecture for now, but they are real considerations for software behemoths that want to solidify monopolies as well as startups seeking to upend traditional consumer brands, technology executives and advisors say. “Everything that’s a physical object is eventually going to be a combination of hardware and services,” said Amar Hanspal, senior vice president for products at design software giant Autodesk. “The more industrial and complex ones are going to come from a traditional hardware company. But the more consumer-oriented and less complex, software companies will enter those product categories a lot more.” The latest signs of that future emerged Tuesday, when Google launched Home, a $130 tabletop device comparable to an alarm clock, except it responds aloud to spoken commands and search queries. It also revealed a Wi-Fi router and the first fully Google-branded smartphones. The unveiling caps a turnabout for a company that originally limited its mobile ambitions to supplying free software to handset makers. Google’s announcement came the week after Snap Inc., formerly Snapchat, shared details about $130 video-camera sunglasses it’s shipping later this year. The convergence of hardware and software follows decades of stark separation (Bell Labs and Apple Inc. being among the few notable exceptions that pursued both). Product makers Sony and Samsung struggled to get into developing software, with bugs and poor architecture drawing negative reviews. Software vendors, used to fat profits and patching problems with updates, avoided the challenge and expense of immutable gadgets. The rise of smartphones and online-fueled global trade have opened doors, though, most of them in the last five years. With more cellphones selling each year than desktops or laptops ever did, prices of Wi-Fi chips, GPS sensors and other technical parts have fallen. Devices no longer need constant tethering to an electrical outlet, mobility that’s stoking software vendors’ imaginations. And because smartphones are always on and nearby, they’re an obvious anchor for a personal gadget ecosystem. Contract factories now can turn around orders quickly, and there’s no waiting for some massive hard drive full of schematics to move by FedEx. Online ads and shops ease distribution and marketing challenges. These developments decreased the money and time needed to build products. Hazards remain. One miscue can devastate multimillion-dollar investments, whether it be a shipping company suddenly going bankrupt or a widespread component spontaneously catching fire (just ask Samsung). “The biggest single thing for software people to grasp is how expensive mistakes are in hardware,” said Jeremy Conrad, founding partner at hardware startup incubator Lemnos Labs.

Here’s its proof New, 188 comments by Nick Statt@nickstatt Oct 7, 2016, 8:30pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Vjeran Pavic Google spent a healthy chunk of time at its Pixel smartphone event on Tuesday touting the new device’s camera, with product VP Brian Rakowski going so far as to call it "the best smartphone camera anyone has ever made," with a DxOMark score of 89. To back up that bold claim, camera lead Isaac Reynolds posted a number of photos taken with either the Pixel or the larger Pixel XL. According to comments on Reynolds’ post from official Google employees, some of the shots were taken by members of Google’s own engineering team. Examining EXIF data proves the photos were taken with one of the those two devices. Yet as Phandroid points out, around half of them did receive some type of post-processing with either the Snapseed or VSCO mobile editing apps. Still, it’s an impressive selection of photography that shows off the Pixel’s versatility in a number of different lighting and color situations.

Udacity promises to give online learners with no prior programming experience the skills to create mobile phone and desktop-based virtual reality “experiences” or applications that can be used on HTC Vive, Google Cardboard, Daydream and Oculus Rift. Christian Plagemann, who co-founded the Google VR team and was a lead developer of Google Cardboard, joined Udacity as a director this year specifically to develop its virtual reality curriculum. He’s managed to pull in corporate partners including Google VR, HTC Vive, and Upload, and stars of the VR industry including Matt Sonic to help develop VR curriculum. Sonic is also an instructor in the Udacity course. https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/udacity-wants-to-get-you-a-job-in-the-nascent-vr-industry/ Share on Facebook This entry was posted on Saturday, October 8th, 2016 at 12:02 am and is filed under Online Learning News.

Strategically situated in one of the USA's most culturally diverse cities, this coding lab is completely free of charge, with attendees giving coding lessons as well as hands-on assignments to keep them occupied and engaged. The teenagers who get in are recommended by their schools, and are given the education and support they need to set them up to compete for coveted coding jobs in the future. The fact of the matter is that the tech world still suffers from a very visible lack of diversity, which is something that the Code Next coding lab has the power to change by encouraging people from different ethnic groups to get interested in coding from a young age.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 8 October 2016 | MYT 7:00 AM Google Trips app aims to make vacations easier by george avalos No more travel stress: Google has launched a trips app that is designed to make journeys a bit easier by letting people plan out a day in a city. — Google/TNS Google has launched a trips app that is designed to make journeys a bit easier by letting people plan out a day in a city.  "See more plan less" is how the company describes the primary benefits of the new Google Trips app.  The app, available on the Google Play Store and the Apple Apps Store, gives people new ways to plan and organise trips, according to the tech titan's blog.  "It automatically maps out a half day or a full day with suggestions for things to see and do," the company said in a post that describes the app's features.  People can do things such as pick a city such as New York City or San Francisco or London and then ask the app to find cafes, parks, beaches, restaurants, landmarks, or other points of interest.  A user of the app also can switch the type of points of interest at a destination.  "Don't like what you see? Tap the 'magic wand' to see more nearby sights," Google said in a post about the app. "Each tap of the wand gives you a fresh set of nearby attractions."  In its post, the company pointed to research that suggests people often don't enjoy vacations because it's too stressful to plan a trip, or once at the destination, travellers miss sites they would have liked to visit.  Mountain View-based Google, in its post, cited a study in 2013 by GoodThink expert Shawn Achor, a researcher into positive psychology.  "Travel can make people happier, healthier and more productive when they return from a vacation," Achor wrote in his report. "But not all travel creates happiness. Travel stress can undo the positive effects of travel."  The app is also available offline, Google said.  "Google Trips is a personalised tour guide in your pocket," the company said.  "Each trip contains key categories of information, including day plans, reservations, things to do, food and drink, and more, so you have everything you need at your fingertips." — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Global industry groups voice opposition to China cybersecurity law Samsung's upcoming folding smartphone could be taking shape Twitter impresses advertisers with BuzzFeed US election livestream Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Home News Apps Hangouts demoted in Google Apps package, Duo gets nod Hangouts won't be mandatory on Google partner phones soon, Duo will be By: Sean Ridgeley | Apps News | Posted: Oct 7, 2016 11:26 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Google recent sent out an e-mail to its Mobile Services partners indicating Hangouts will no longer be required to be bundled with hardware. Rather, video calling app Duo will take its place.     "Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products," it reads. "This change will take effect on December 1, 2016."   What's also interesting is Google's text messaging app Allo isn't getting the nod alongside Duo; for whatever reason, the company is content to not push the text side of their new communication apps in this regard, at least for the time being.   In any case, Google will continue to support Hangouts; it simply won't be mandatory anymore on partner hardware.

The Internet giant has had stores inside stores. But it does not — at least not yet — have the equivalent of Apple stores. But the introduction of a high-end line of hardware marks a new era for the Internet giant and there's the hint that a more ambitious brick-and-mortar retail strategy may be in the making. Google is in the midst of a new and very aggressive push to sell its own consumer electronic devices, rather than supplying the software to manufacturers. © Jessica Guynn, for USA TODAY Google's new consumer electronics devices will be displayed in a pop-up shop in New York City on Oct. 20. Pop-up shops are a common prelude to establishing a bigger retail presence. That's what Microsoft did with Xbox and Surface and Samsung has also done pop-ups for the holidays. "It seems inevitable that they need some kind of hardware presence to show this stuff off in a consistent and joined-up way," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research. The challenge? Opening retail outlets is a costly and time-consuming endeavor if Google wants to reach a significant chunk of the U.S. population, Dawson said. "Look at Apple – it launched its first stores 15 years ago, has been ramping up steadily since, and still has under 300 US stores. Microsoft is an even more relevant and a more recent example," he said. "If you’re willing to sacrifice some of the premium in the retail experience, you can roll out more quickly – Microsoft has around 100 US stores. But Microsoft can show off both its own devices and third party devices – I’m not sure Google could reasonably do the same in its retail stores." Among the Google devices that will be on display: the new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, virtual reality headset Daydream View, Google Home smart speaker and Google WiFi.

If you want the Play Store on the phones you make, then you need to play ball with Google - and, among other things, agree to preinstall a certain list of apps. This changes from time to time, and come December 1 it will change once more. From that point on, Google Duo will become a mandatory preinstall for Android phones, replacing Hangouts in that role. Hangouts will be an optional preinstall, meaning some manufacturers may choose to ship it with their devices, but most probably won't. On the other hand, this means Duo will come preinstalled on every single Android handset released after December 1. So those market share gains it's made already are only going to get bigger. Obviously this doesn't mean Hangouts is dead per se, but unbundling it from the mandatory Google apps package is yet another step in the search giant's strategy of making this a business communications platform of sorts - and not a consumer-oriented product. When it comes to messaging, that role now goes to Allo, Google's umpteenth effort in this space, and yet another try at competing with Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger. Oddly though, Allo is not part of the aforementioned Google apps list, at least not yet.

By Regina F. Graham For Dailymail.com Published: 18:49 EST, 7 October 2016 | Updated: 07:20 EST, 8 October 2016 e-mail 3.5k shares 490 View comments WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange promised 'significant' disclosures on subjects including the U.S. election and Google in the coming weeks as the secret-spilling group marked its 10th anniversary on Tuesday. Assange said WikiLeaks plans to start publishing new material starting this week, but wouldn't specify the timing and subject and warned that the so called 'October Surprise' may expose Google. The war between Assange and the tech giant started in 2014 when he wrote about the company in his book titled, 'When Google Met Wikileaks', according to Recode. 'Nobody wants to acknowledge that Google has grown big and bad,' Assange wrote in the book.  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (pictured in 2016) promised 'significant' disclosures on subjects including the U.S. election and Google in the coming weeks as the secret-spilling group marked its 10th anniversary on Tuesda Assange (pictured above on Tuesday) said WikiLeaks plans to start publishing new material starting this week 'But it has. Schmidt's tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation.'  Assange became concerned about former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's ties with the State Department in 2009 when Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of state. He has claimed that Schmidt, who is a chairman at the company, has worked with the Clintons for years, as Donald Trump accused Google of political bias saying that it suppresses negative news about Clinton.   Speaking by video link to an anniversary news conference in Berlin earlier this week, he said the leaks include 'significant material' on war, arms, oil, internet giant Google, the U.S. election and mass surveillance. WikiLeaks hopes 'to be publishing every week for the next 10 weeks,' Assange said. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next BREAKING NEWS: Vladimir Putin publicly accused by U.S....

Share this article Share Assange wrote in his 2014 book that 'Schmidt's (file above) tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation' The group, which released Democratic National Committee emails days before the party's national convention earlier this year, wouldn't say who or what campaign would be affected by the upcoming U.S. election leaks.  Assange said speculation that he or WikiLeaks intend to harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is 'false.' Asked whether he feels any personal affinity with Clinton's Republican rival, Donald Trump, Assange replied: 'I feel personal affinity really, I think, with all human beings.' 'I certainly feel sorry for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,' he added. 'These are two people that are tormented by their ambitions in different ways.' Assange claimed that Schmidt has worked with the Clintons for years, as Donald Trump accused Google (file) of political bias saying that it suppresses negative news about Clinton  Wikileaks came to prominence a decade ago by publishing classified documents that related to prisoners in the United States' Guantanamo Bay, NSA surveillance of world leaders and military operations in Afghanistan.  In addition, millions of diplomatic and military files were made public by Wikileaks from US soldier Chelsea Manning who is currently serving a 35-year prison term for leaking the information.  Sweden is seeking Assange's extradition in a rape investigation.  He hasn't left the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012.  Assange denies the rape allegation and says he fears being extradited to the U.S. to face espionage charges if he leaves.

Turns out that was partially true. As of the 1st of December, Google will no longer require Hangouts to be preinstalled on Android phones. This is according to an email sent to the company’s Mobile Services partners, in which Google made a change to the core GMS package. “Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016.” In case you did not know, Google usually requires OEMs to bundle a suite of Google apps/services if they want to use Android on their phones. For a while now Hangouts was one of the default apps but like the email reads, Hangouts will no longer be a required app and will be replaced by Duo. This doesn’t mean that Hangouts is dead. OEMs still have the option of bundling Hangouts if they want, but they are just no longer required to. Interestingly enough we had always assumed that if anything, Allo would be a more suitable replacement for Hangouts, not Duo. n the meantime Google is expected to focus Hangouts on its business users.

For one, Nexus devices had little visibility in their absence at relevant carrier stores around the globe, but other forms of ads were never really pushed either. Chances are you’ve never seen a giant Nexus billboard on the road, and it would be hard for you to remember an ad box inside of a newspaper. But nobody, starting with Google, ever expected that to happen, either; Nexus phones were not meant to be iPhone or Galaxy S rivals, if not on the spec sheet and quality-wise. Pixel, however, is a rather different story. A story that is ostensibly starting just now, as both the two Chromebook Pixels and the Pixel C haven’t enjoyed the limelight too much either. We actually started seeing this before the Pixel and Pixel XL were even a thing; Google flexed its advertising muscle to let people know that… it was hosting an event. It is something very few other companies do, like Apple or Samsung with its usual “#TheNextGalaxy” campaign. And, now that the gates have been opened, Google is doubling down on what is arguably its flagship product. I am lucky enough to live in London, and given that the UK has been selected among the first markets where Google will sell its devices, I’m already seeing this commitment imprinted in the environment around me. And what struck me is not just the seeming ubiquity of these ads, but the actual kind of places I saw them. Save for the usual carrier store, I saw the Pixel advertised on massive billboards, the front page of the free newspaper handed out to hundreds and hundreds of people at the entrance of every London Underground station, and even in the massive area opposed to the trains’ platform — a spot usually destined to the iPhone. We also know that Google is planning to open a pop-up store in New York City come October 20th, and that will run through the holidays. Also, as per a Reuters report, the whole advertising campaign for television will start with a massive $3.2M spending, with more to come. Even Mario Queiroz, Google’s Vice President of Product Management, told Reuters that it was a “very significant marketing campaign”, also alluding at potential million-dollar-worth ads to show during the Thanksgiving football games. This is certainly a noteworthy shift in Google’s strategy, and a clear reflection of Rick Osterloh’s words at this week’s past event: Google is serious about hardware and the whole “Made by Google” thing, which is definitely not a one-off shot; they are in it ‘for the long run’. Take a look at a few shots down below. This is Old Street, where this massive four-faced billboard only shows Google-related stuff. As of now, the four screens are entirely dedicated to the Pixel. This is a “standard” ad outside one of EE’s store. This is Oxford Street, however, where literally thousands of people walk by every day. Front page of The Evening Standard, a free newspaper you can find at each of the tube’s stops. Part one of a massive ad inside of Bond Street’s station — a pretty crowded one, I assure you. Part 2.

When it was first unveiled back at Google I/O this year we were curious to see what Google plans to do in the space. Check out our brief hands-on with the device to see our initial impressions. At launch, the device will have support for several music services and other apps. Google finally released a full list of supported apps at launch. While there’s no public API for Google Home for developers to tie app support yet hopefully, it’s something Google will consider releasing in the future.

Duo, Google’s new video chat app, will take the place of Hangouts. As a result, Duo will come pre-installed on every single new Android smartphone released in 2017 and beyond. It’s important to note this does not mean Google is preparing to shut down Hangouts — though the company has already noted it plans to remake Hangouts into a business-to-business offering. Moreover, OEMs can continue to pre-install Hangouts should they choose to do so. Hangouts will also continue to be available on the Google Play Store. That said, it’s still a telling move on the part of Google. While Hangouts may have its fans, the company is now clearly more concerned with the success of Allo, its new AI assisted chat app, and Duo. On that note, Google has not added Allo to the list of required GMS apps, though it’s likely that move is forthcoming. SourceAndroid Police Roger I like Hangout because I can use it from my Gmail of Inbox page. I hope they’ll find a way to integrate Allo in a similar fashion when/if they shut down Hangouts for personal use. Shawn I am surprised they didn’t add Allo also with Dou immediately. Something must have been uncertain when the paperwork was being drawn up. John W Allo is still in testing Shawn Why do you think this? Was this stated somewhere? John W Hmm i read that somewhere that it was widely available now but not final yet. Shawn I sideloaded Allo when it came out. I saw someone say something that made me wonder if my version was up to date or not. When I looked at the version number I noticed it listed the version number as “1.0.006_RC18.” Part of me sees Release Candidate 18 and it makes me wonder if this is confirmation of what you were saying. The other part of me thinks that RC18 was the one that was selected, and they simply didn’t remove the RC designator because that would be changing the file. southerndinner Until Duo properly supports multiple devices at the same time like virtually all of its competition, I have absolutely no interest in it. fred Bad decision. Hangouts works just fine. Better than Duo. Ipse Voice calls to phone numbers….anyone? This goes the way of the Dodo bird and Google Voice. Maybe Google can ASK users what THEY want…. Brad Fortin “As a result, Duo will come pre-installed on every single new Android smartphone released in 2017 and beyond.” … or until Google releases *another* new messaging platform. Probably at the next I/O. Can’t Fix Stupid Googles Apps and Android strategies are an inconsistent mess. Google Now for photos…nope it’s now over in Google photos. Project Aura…nope shelved. Allo, Duo…hangouts? Who knows. Nexus gone. Pixel? How about some Apple prices.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:55 AM, October 8, 2016 Google's new "Pixel" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics<005930.KS> and Apple Inc <AAPL.O>. Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's<GOOGL.O> Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc <VZ.N>, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it’s OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

Google this week said that substantial progress has been made with the open-source Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) initiative in the one year since it launched last October. The AMP project is a Google-led effort to enable a faster mobile web. Under the effort, the company is trying to get website owners to implement the AMP protocol for creating lightweight web pages for mobile devices. The project is part of a Digital News Initiative that Google launched last year for publishers in Europe but is now being applied on a broader scale. Publishers who were the first to get on AMP have seen substantial benefits from having fast-loading mobile content, David Besbris, Google's vice president of search and AMP, wrote on the company's Europe blog. As one example, Besbris pointed to the Washington Post, which after implementing AMP has seen a 23 percent increase in mobile users who return within one week. The Post currently publishes more than 1,000 AMP-enabled articles each day, and nearly 55 percent of online traffic comes from mobile users. Since implementing AMP, page load times are 88 percent faster than they were with its previous mobile website, the Post claimed in a case study posted on the AMP project website. Average page load times are now just 400 milliseconds, the Post said. The boost in page load times from AMP has benefited publishers in other ways as well, Besbris said. A study conducted by Plista, one of Europe's largest advertising platforms, showed that average click-through rate for publishers jumped a whopping 220 percent for sites that had implemented AMP, he said. "To date the AMP project has been a story about momentum," Besbris said. In addition to more websites implementing the protocol, the pace of code releases for the open-source protocol has also kept growing, he said. In the one year since the AMP project launched, website owners around the world have created over 600 million AMP documents in 104 languages. In addition to publishers, other sites such as retail, travel and recipe websites have implementing the protocol, he said. For its part, Google has been trying to encourage adoption of AMP by highlighting pages that have been enabled for the protocol in mobile search, Besbris said. Now when users search for content using their smartphones or tablets, they will see an AMP icon to indicate pages that will load faster on their devices. For the moment at least, Google has said that AMP will not have a direct impact on how it ranks mobile search engine results. But going forward, the company has indicated that it will favor websites and web pages that have been optimized for the mobile web over sites that have not. In addition to highlighting search results, Google has also launched AMP-enabled stories in the "Top Stories" portion in Google Search on mobile. Google has cast AMP largely as an effort that will benefit internet users, publishers and website owners in general. But the company also has a lot to gain from enabling a faster web experience for mobile users. As a company that derives almost all of its revenues and profits from online advertising, Google stands to profit from having web pages—and the ads that go along with those pages—load faster on mobile devices. Google's own research shows that 53 percent of users will abandon a site or web page if it fails to load within 3 seconds.           LATEST ENTERPRISE APPS ARTICLES   Windows 10 Sticky Notes Grow More Insightful in More Languages Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters IBM Launches Project Intu for Embodied Cognition Microsoft Releases First SharePoint Server Feature Pack Google to Shelve Free Map Maker Tool                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) (Eric Risberg) Print Email Wilborn P. Nobles III, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Wilborn P. Nobles III, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 07, 2016 at 3:45 PM comments A car crash involving one of Google's driverless cars landed its test driver in the hospital in September, according to a report from Quartz.com. In Google's monthly self-driving car report released Thursday (Oct. 6), the Internet search giant said another vehicle ran a red light and slammed into the right side of its Lexus SUV on Sept. 23. The driverless car was moving through a green light when it "detected another vehicle traveling" at 30 mph, according to the report. Google's car applied the brakes "in anticipation that the other vehicle would run through the red light," but the report added that the driver then took manual control of the car.  The report does not address if the test driver made the right call, but the website said the phrasing of the report suggests the driver interfered with the car's ability to avoid a crash. Although the report said no injuries were reported, the driver later "voluntarily went to a local hospital" where he was later released. The report from Google comes as companies begin to put driverless technology on the road despite safety concerns among critics and federal regulators alike. In February, Google admitted fault when one of its driverless cars collided with a bus in California. Google currently has 58 driverless vehicles operating in four different states, in which they have driven more than 2 million miles.

The company is on track to reach 45 metros total by the end of 2016. By Conner Forrest | October 7, 2016, 12:33 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/solarseven AT&T will bring its gigabit internet service to 11 more metro areas in the US, the company announced on Tuesday. According to a press release, the expansion is part of a newly-created umbrella brand called AT&T Fiber, which will explore new technologies for internet connectivity. "Customer demand for high-speed connectivity is exceeding even our high expectations. Today we're also introducing the AT&T Fiber umbrella brand, which lets us bring ultra-fast internet to even more residential and business customers through a mix of the latest network technologies," David Christopher, CMO of the AT&T Entertainment Group, said in the press release. Under the new AT&T Fiber brand, AT&T GigaPower will be rebranded as AT&T Internet 1000. Currently, AT&T offers fiber internet service in 29 US metro areas. The additional 11 will bring the total number to 40, but AT&T said in the press release that they are targeting deployment in 45 total metro areas by the end of 2016. They also said they are planning to hit at least 67 in total sometime in the future. SEE: Google's Fiber lottery: Predicting who's next and how Google picks winners To see what metro areas are available now, and which areas AT&T currently has underway, check out this map. In terms of the recent expansion, AT&T is targeting the following 11 areas: Florida: Gainesville and Panama City Georgia: Columbus Kentucky: Central Kentucky Louisiana: Lafayette Mississippi: Biloxi-Gulfport and Northeast Mississippi North Carolina: Wilmington Tennessee: Southeastern Tennessee and Knoxville Texas: Corpus Christi AT&T said in its press release that it had planned to be in 12.5 million total locations by mid-2019, but if development continues at its current rate, then those plans could be surpassed. AT&T also said that it has connected more than 1 million "incremental business customer locations" to fiber as well.

However, Verizon Fios claims coverage in only 12 US cities, and while Google Fiber had expanded rapidly for a while, it was recently reported that the company was cutting jobs amid poor adoption rates. However, there is another reason why AT&T is aggressively expanding its fiber network—it was ordered to do so by the government. When AT&T purchased DirecTV back in the summer of 2015, the FCC set requirements that AT&T had to build out a fiber network to provide high-speed internet connection to at least 12.5 million people within four years. The idea was that it would increase competition among internet providers and (assumedly) would make it easier for cord cutters in areas where AT&T and DirecTV would no longer be competing. Regardless of the motivations behind it, AT&T is on track to become the largest fiber internet provider in the US. And, if the market matures and adoption increases, AT&T will be in a strong position as one of the top providers in the country. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers AT&T will be expanding its fiber internet services into 11 more metro areas in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. AT&T is quickly growing past its biggest competitors, Verizon and Google, and could end up as the top provider for fiber internet. The reason AT&T is targeting so many regions is to fulfill requirement set by the FCC during its purchase of DirecTV in 2015.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel XL’s Geekbench performance scores not as impressive By R Padla - October 7, 2016 5 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We’re very much looking forward to reading reviews about the new Pixel and Pixel XL. These new phones from Google is the first pair of smartphones without the Nexus tag. Manufactured by HTC, the two Pixels are expected to impress the mobile industry. But right now, we don’t have reports and figures to show you except for the scores of a recent Geekbench performance test. The numbers of the Google Pixel XL for both single-core test and multi-core test hit 1648 and 4121, respectively. This may be an early benchmark and analysis but the numbers are disappointing because the Pixel XL is already equipped with a Snapdragon 821. It’s expected to perform better than the Snapdragon 820. The latter is found in most of the latest premium phones available in the market today like the Galaxy Note 7, Galaxy S7/S7 edge, LG G5, HTC 10, and OnePlus 3 among others. As for the Pixel XL, it’s the first-ever S821-powered smartphone to be released in the US. There’s that expectation of better performance but unfortunately, the Google Pixel XL with Snapdragon 821 didn’t show a significant improvement. Scores are still high though but close or similar to the Qualcomm S820-equipped phones. We’re not sure how different or better the Snapdragon 821 should be but we were at least expecting longer battery life, faster browsing, and the phone not heating up quickly. The scores aren’t always good indicators because calculations may differ every time. We’re still looking forward to more test, analyses, tear downs, and reviews before we can say if the Pixel series is worth our attention or not.

[Tech News Digest] Samsung Recalls the Galaxy Note 7, Google Kills Project Ara... [Tech News Digest] Samsung recalls the Galaxy Note 7 over faulty batteries, Google shelves Project Ara, Apple is removing dysfunctional apps from iTunes, Instagram adds pinch-to-zoom, and why YouTubers are freaking out right now. Read More . Many consumers don’t get their money back. Fortunately, you can get reimbursed for all manner of mishaps — even for out-of-warranty devices. However, refunds may require a credit card, documentation, and persistence. Let’s start with a hypothetical scenario: you purchased a device, and it breaks. What should you do? Your course of action depends on when you bought the device, whether you used a credit card, and what kind of credit card you own. Some cards can get even smashed or stolen items refunded. On top of that, almost all credit cards offer extended warranties that can get your money back well after the warranty ends. When Did the Device Break or Go Missing? Within 30 days of purchase? Most retailers take returns if the device breaks within 30 days (sometimes less). Between 31 and 90 days after purchase on a credit card? Those with lost, broken, or stolen devices may need to rely on a credit card company. Within the warranty period? If the device breaks inside of the manufacturer’s warranty period, return it to the manufacturer. The device broke a year after the warranty ended? File a claim with your credit card company. Did the Device Fail Within 30 Days? If your device fails within 30 days, return the device to the retailer. Most retailers offer no-hassle returns, provided the customer brings the product back within the return period. The return period differs depending on the retailer. Here are a few electronics dealers and their policies: Newegg’s return policy depends on the component. Computer motherboards aren’t returnable, for example. The standard return period is 30 days. Amazon’s return policy is a standard 30 days. eBay’s unofficial return policy is 30 days, although most fall somewhere around 14 days. Best Buy’s standard return policy offers a 15-day window, although they also handle warranty returns. Apple’s return policy is 14 days. Even worst-case scenarios are salvageable. If the seller refuses to provide a refund on defective merchandise, you can contact your credit card issuer and initiate a credit card chargeback. A chargeback forcibly refunds money from the fraudulent seller to the buyer. Ads by Google However, I caution against using chargebacks as the first line of defense against scams. It’s better used as a last resort. Credit card companies take chargebacks very seriously, and abuse can lead to legal trouble. However, if the device gets stolen or broken through misuse, the return period gets invalidated. Fortunately, if you used a particular type of credit card, there’s an additional degree of protection called purchase protection, which covers up to 90 days after the sale. The Device Breaks or Is Lost Within 90 Days The manufacturer’s warranty only covers defective devices — usually within a year from the day of purchase. This protection doesn’t extend to accidental damage or theft. Fortunately, a few credit cards include an insurance policy known as Purchase Protection or Purchase Assurance. The exact terminology depends on the credit group. Purchase protection gets buyers their money back in case of accident, theft, or acts of God. There are a lot of variations in how claims get processed but, in general, you need the following documentation: Original receipt (electronic copies also work); Original warranty card or documentation (sometimes required); The credit card used to make the purchase; Account statement showing the purchase; And a police report, if stolen. I tested Chase’s Purchase Protection, and the process is identical to filing an insurance claim. Card holders need to call their card provider and speak with its benefits division. The card holder must then request to activate Purchase Protection. At this point, filing a claim can be done either electronically or via snail mail. During this process, a claims inspector must validate your paperwork and documentation, which can take months. If successful, the credit company remits all, or part, of the money. Here’s the email that I received after filing the claim via telephone: I just printed and filled out the requisite paperwork, attached it to the form included with the email, and mailed it out. The Device Breaks Within the Warranty Period If the gadget breaks within the manufacturer’s warranty period, first contact the manufacturer. (We recommend using GetHuman.) However, sometimes the manufacturer doesn’t answer emails or calls. In this case, two courses of action can help get your money back: invoke the extended warranty or escalate the conflict. Use Your Credit Card’s Extended Warranty Credit companies — almost universally — bundle extended warranties with their cards. A credit card company’s extended warranty adds one to two years to the original manufacturer’s warranty. Replacement policies vary by credit group. For example, Cardhub’s analysis indicates that American Express provides — by a large margin — the best extended warranty service out of the four credit groups. You need the following documentation to invoke the card’s extended warranty: Original receipt (electronic copies aren’t accepted); Original warranty card or documentation; The credit card used to make the purchase; Account statement showing the purchase. The terms of the extended warranty vary by individual credit groups. For example, Visa Signature cards (but not all Visa cards) extend the warranty by a whopping two years. Both CardHub and Nerdwallet, on the other hand, regard American Express as the overall best credit group for extended warranties. Escalate the Conflict When a device breaks within the warranty period — and you aren’t responsible — contact the manufacturer. Unfortunately, that means dealing with customer service. Again, we recommend using the website GetHuman. Returning a defective device requires a return merchandise authorization (RMA). Getting an RMA requires some patience, for several reasons. First, dealing with customer support may entail escalation. If customer support cannot equitably resolve your case, you must speak with a higher support tier. For example, if a technician concludes that your laptop works fine, you must ask to speak with a supervisor. If the supervisor cannot resolve the issue, you must speak to the supervisor’s superior. Unfortunately, delinquent manufacturers won’t honor warranties. If you didn’t use a credit card to purchase the device, you might need to complain through social media Are You Getting The Most Out Of Your Customer Service Experience? Are You Getting The Most Out Of Your Customer Service Experience? Have you ever called customer service, only to end the call frustrated, disappointed and without resolution?

Unfortunately, if your device fails outside the warranty period, contacting customer service may not help. The Device Fails After Two Years If the device fails outside of the warranty, your options narrow. While a credit card’s extended warranty can run up to two years past the manufacturer’s warranty, in most cases, two years spells the end of a potential refund.

Close share panel × There are three main issues the UK needs to address if it is going to build a technology company on the scale of Google, according to a group of entrepreneurs. For the BBC's recent Tech Talent week we asked why the UK can't build a company on the scale of Google. Media captionAlex Depledge chairs the Coalition for a Digital Economy (COADEC) Each day we did a video profile of someone with a stake in the UK tech economy, to get their perspective on the issue. Our guests were established technology entrepreneurs Alex Depledge and Herman Narula; aspiring start-up founders Ben Stanway and David Kramaley; and start-up mentor Stefano Tresca. Each person made his or her contribution separately. Nonetheless, three common ideas emerged for plotting a route to UK tech success. Big breakthrough role models Success breeds success. You knew this already. But had you considered this can be both psychological and practical? Ben Stanway, in his twenties, has just started his entrepreneurial journey with his app Moneybox, which is barely a month old in the App Store. It allows you simultaneously to track your personal finances and to invest. He admitted to craving psychological inspiration from entrepreneurial role models in the UK. Media captionNew founder Ben Stanway craves role models "This is a very important thing," he explained. The more role models there are, the better it is for the whole ecosystem. So it's great to see companies such as TransferWise and Deliveroo succeed globally." For Herman Narula, founder and chief executive of virtual reality company Improbable, these success stories also need to fire up the imagination. "We need to be comfortable with the idea of setting up a company to find something mind-blowingly important, like electric cars or space travel. We need a single, breakout success." Indeed UK entrepreneurs with "megalomaniac" ambitions are what we need, according to Stefano Tresca. He is in close contact with the start-up community, as co-founder of Level 39, an incubator initiative in London. American entrepreneurs have a natural desire to become the biggest company in the world, he said. "It's not that European entrepreneurs are lazy, but if you aim the bar low, it's very hard to build something big." "Europeans love to cash out and sell their company, live the good life, and that includes me," he admitted. Media captionStefano Tresca talks about ambition and investors in the UK However, success when it comes will bring very practical advantages to everyone, explained entrepreneur Alex Depledge. "We don't really have that many people in the UK or even Europe who have captained or been a part of an early stage company as it scales up rapidly." She sold her online business for booking domestic cleaners, Hassle, to a German company after three years for £24m. Looking back, she feels a shallow talent pool held back growth. "It's like the blind leading the blind." Digital Europe For Alex Depledge and fellow seasoned entrepreneur Herman Narula, the issue of Brexit weighed heavily on their minds. What they feared most was losing access to something that is still emerging: the European Digital Single Market. This is an initiative by the European Commission to harmonise rules for doing digital business in Europe. It was launched by Jean-Claude Juncker in May last year and covers everything from copyright and data protection to digital business regulation. "We need to make the Digital European Single Market for e-economy come true," said Herman Narula. "That would be amazing for companies trying to build successful platforms." Media captionHerman Narula shares his vision for success in the UK If the UK wants to match the US in building vast technology companies, said Alex Depledge, matching its consumer base by tapping into Europe makes sense. "Imagine this, the US has a domestic market of 300 million consumers. In the UK our market is 70 million. But put us in Europe and it's 500 million. But the cost of us doing business across Europe is so much greater than the cost within the US, where state to state their markets are quite harmonised. "Unfortunately, for me, the vote for Brexit has just set ourselves back at least four or five steps in that mission to create companies as big as Apple and Google." It remains to be seen during Brexit negotiations whether the UK can gain access to any benefits from this emerging Digital Single Market. Ambition please, investors... "Too many conservative investors in Europe is a problem," said Stefano Tresca, "because now it's a global fight. "If you don't have the money to fight the US competition, however good you are, you can lose." David Kramaley is on the sharp end of this phenomenon. The American start-up entrepreneur is trying to make it in the UK with his chess app, Chessable. "European investors treat [you] cautiously and really want to know when they are going to see a return on their investment, [whereas] American investors feel they are part of the team," he explained. Media captionDavid Kramaley on how UK and US investors differ "Tech start-ups will always be risky ventures," he pointed out. "So it's not about lending, it's about being part of it." Moneybox founder Ben Stanway was also struck by this. "In the US they are very interested in what countries you want to expand into next," he recalled. "But in the UK we've had questions on whether we need to grow the team quite so fast." US tech firms raised $39bn (£25bn) last year, while UK ones raised $3.6bn (£2.4bn). But the problem isn't just down to frigidity among investors. There are bigger forces at work, according to two of our contributors. "We don't have the sophistication in the financial markets," explained Alex Depledge. There is funding available for the early stages of growth, she explained, but this starts to dry up when you need sums like £10m or more, to take your company to the next level. A US tech company can realistically look to float on the stock market, which is why they grow as big as they can, pointed out Stefano Tresca. Hence in their early days Google refused an offer from Yahoo, and Facebook resisted the charms of Google. There is less appetite among UK stock-pickers for tech companies, so instead UK tech companies grow to a reasonable size and sell out to a tech giant in a private sale. Eventually, all these entrepreneurs hope, it won't be just the ideas and the talent that originate in the UK, but the finance too. You can follow business reporter Dougal Shaw on Twitter or Facebook.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Leak  ⋮  Mobile Verizon Leaks Google Pixel Phone’s Additional Information, Including New Color Models By Omar Sohail Posted 1 month ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit There are a good 10 hours remaining for the official announcement from Google regarding its Pixel and Pixel XL, but Verizon has managed to spill some additional information about the two smartphones. This information will probably lead you to make into making a better decision when upgrading to a new Android handset in the foreseeable future. Verizon Leaks a New Color Model for the Google Pixel Phones, as Well as the Available Storage Capacities Thanks to Verizon, we now know that there are going to be a total of three color variants of the Pixel devices: Silver Black Blue One other feature that Verizon managed to leak about the handsets is something called ‘Google Magic’. It’s definitely a feature listed, but sadly, there is no description of what it will actually do. Hopefully, when one of the executives get up on stage and decide to showcase ‘Google Magic’ in front of our eyes, we will know more about what it can do. As for the strengthened security, that’s a feature that all pure-Android devices are known for. If you want the best security and software updates to be released for your device first, then you’d best be owning a Pixel smartphone, or a device with the brand name Nexus labelled on it. One other thing you should know is that you will have two storage options to choose from: 32 and 128GB of internal memory. Since these devices are not going to arrive with expandable storage, you should take your sweet time in deciding which one to get. If you’re going to keep your device for a significantly long period, then it’s highly recommended that you invest in the 128GB storage model. At times, even 32GB of internal memory might fall short, even for casual users, so make sure you have plenty of storage available at your disposal. Advertisement Disappointingly enough, there isn’t a 256GB storage model included, but that would be a bit overkill because 128GB is definitely the sweet spot for storage lovers. What Verizon didn’t cater to is the pricing and availability of these devices, but with only a few hours remaining, looks like we’ll get to know about these elusive details now, won’t we? If you want to know more about what’s going to be announced today, be sure to go through our Google’s October 4 event roundup so that you are brought up to speed.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google launched the Pixel and Pixel XL as a Verizon exclusive in the U.S., though you can also buy the phones unlocked straight from the Google Store website and at Best Buy. While Verizon is the only U.S. carrier selling the devices in stores, it looks like that may change early next month. AT&T is allegedly set to start selling the Pixel and Pixel XL in the first week of November, according to Android Central editor Jerry Hildenbrand. He shared the news on Twitter, noting that multiple “trustworthy” sources have been telling him the same thing. However, Hildenbrand admits that he doesn’t have enough evidence to report the rumor as news. @HsnAlmaweri @androidcentral OK.

Andy Boxall Digital TrendsOctober 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Look out Apple, Samsung, and just about every other smartphone maker out there, because Google’s coming for you with the new Pixel smartphones. There are two, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and they run the very latest version of Android, look super, and have some exclusive features to make sure smartphone fans sit up and take notice. They come just a few weeks after Apple’s latest iPhone models went on sale. Like the Pixel there are two different types, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and they both look great, have some special features not seen on other iPhones, and as always with an Apple launch, made people sit up and take notice. Related: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 — which 5-inch flagship is right for you? Inevitably, if you’re about to buy a new phone, these two will be on your list. The Pixel naturally goes up against the iPhone 7, so which one should you buy? Each phone has its own positive and negative points, and we’ve given them an thorough examination to find out which deserves your money.

It uses the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, which is a small but significant update to the Snapdragon 820, seen in most major flagship phones released during 2016. The 64-bit Snapdragon 821 has four cores and gets a 10 percent performance bump over the already speedy Snapdragon 820, a 5 percent increase in graphical capabilities, is more energy efficient, and can use Quick Charge 3.0 for even faster battery recharging. Apple doesn’t use a Snapdragon chip, and instead uses the A10 Fusion chip of its own design. Apparently it’s 40 percent faster than the A9, according to Apple, and it’s the first time the company has used a quad-core chip. Both chips utilize the multiple cores in a similar way, splitting the workload across them to reduce power consumption during easy tasks. The Snapdragon 821 is so new, we’ve not seen a phone with it inside to test out yet, so establishing any of our own benchmarks is impossible. Early benchmark results seen in Geekbench 4 return a multi-core score of 4,089. The iPhone 7 managed 5,600. Does that make the Pixel a slowcoach? No, and we’re wary of that unconfirmed benchmark, as the Galaxy S7 regularly scores over 5,000, and it uses a Snapdragon 820 chip. At this early stage, we can’t say either phone is faster than the other. However, we know the iPhone 7 is quick, and have no reason to think the Snapdragon 821 will be any different. Elsewhere, the Pixel comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and doesn’t have a MicroSD card slot, sadly. The iPhone 7 adds a 256GB option to the list, so if masses of storage are important to you (and you can stomach the extra cost), the Apple phone has a slight advantage here. Winner: Tie (pending further tests) Design iphone-7More Read More This is ultimately going to come down to personal preference, but there are a few things you should keep in mind as you size the two up. The Pixel is made of metal, glass, and plastic. The glass panel on the rear provides the antenna with room to breathe, while the plastic sections recall manufacturer HTC’s Desire range of phones. It’s thin at 7.1mm and light at 143 grams. For the iPhone 7, Apple has blended in the antenna breaks more than on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, decluttering the rear panel, but keeping the camera bump. Google has avoided this by slightly enlarging the body itself. The iPhone 7’s body is made from aluminum, is 7.1mm thick, and a little lighter than the Pixel at 138 grams. In our hands-on, the Pixel is described as being, “high-end, not too heavy, or fragile, even with the half-glass back.” Concerns over the screen bezel are also unfounded, with it appearing larger in pictures than in real life. The iPhone 7 is extremely comfortable to hold, with wonderfully curved sides, and corners that nestle in the palm nicely. Arguably, the Pixel looks a lot like an iPhone, but this doesn’t really bother us — both are great looking phones. Google gives you the choice of a white, black, or limited edition blue Pixel, and it’s the blue that really catches the eye. The iPhone 7’s jet black color is the elusive limited edition for showoffs, and it’s the regular matte black that’s the winner, as it neatly conceals the antenna lines for a smooth look. Google’s phones have never been stunners, while the iPhone 7 has a class that the Pixel can’t quite match, supreme in-hand comfort, and a real premium build, which along with its lighter body and wider choice of colors sees it edge out the Pixel here. Winner: iPhone 7 Battery and audio Google Pixel phoneMore Google has selected a 2,770mAh battery for the Pixel, complete with fast charging provided by the Snapdragon 821 and Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 feature. Plug it in using the USB Type-C cable and after 15 minutes it’ll be at 70 percent capacity. We’ve not used the phone for long enough to judge the overall use time on a daily basis. Inside the iPhone 7 is a 1,960mAh battery and in our review, we have seen 12 hours of solid use, and more than 40 percent left at the end of a day. There’s no fast charging though, and recharging the iPhone 7 will take longer than the Pixel. Neither phone has wireless charging as standard. The iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, and audio performance is vastly improved over the iPhone 6S while the Pixel has a single downward firing speaker. However, the Pixel retains a 3.5mm headphone socket, while Apple forces you to use headphones with a Lightning connector or Bluetooth. More battery capacity, faster charging, and a traditional headphone socket make the Pixel a clear winner. Winner: Google Pixel Display Apple iPhone 7 PlusMore Looking at the numbers, the Pixel should run away here. The 5-inch display is an AMOLED panel, therefore producing deep blacks and strong colors. It has a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution and a 441ppi pixel density, is covered in protective 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4, and Google claims it has an excellent viewing angle with little decrease in brightness. Related: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The iPhone’s Retina HD LED-backlit screen measures 4.7-inches, has a 1,334 x 750 pixel resolution for a 326ppi pixel density, and also a 2.5D piece of glass over the front. Although it has a lower resolution, it does still look great, but the Pixel’s AMOLED screen and higher pixel count will automatically make pictures, webpages, and games look better. However, there is one thing in the iPhone 7’s favor, and that’s 3D Touch, Apple’s pressure sensitive system. Here, additional functionality can be accessed with a harder screen press, and it’s surprisingly helpful, especially with iOS 10 installed. The Pixel doesn’t have this feature. Despite this, it’s as much a software feature as it is a display feature, giving the Pixel the win. Winner: Google Pixel Camera Google Pixel phoneMore Let’s start with a spec shootout. The Pixel and the iPhone 7 both have 12-megapixel rear cameras. The Pixel has an f/2.0 aperture against the iPhone 7’s f/1.8 aperture, which should let in a little more light, plus it has a quad-LED flash rather than the Pixel’s dual-LED. However, while both have phase detection autofocus, laser autofocus only comes on the Pixel. Both have image stabilization, but only the iPhone uses traditional OIS, as the Pixel has a clever system that utilizes the phone’s gyroscope for smoothing out video. We’re big fans of the iPhone 7’s camera, although consider the iPhone 7 Plus to be the real winner, but have yet to really put the Pixel’s camera to the test. In our hands-on with the phone, we noted the speed with which it captured and processed photos, along with its low-light performance and cool HDR+ mode. The Pixel also has free, unlimited full resolution photo storage in the cloud through Google Photos, while you’ll have to pay for extra iCloud space or full-res Google Photos storage if you own an iPhone. Until we get our hands on the Pixel for a full review, we must turn to well-respected camera testers DxOMark, where the Pixel received an 89 rating, the highest of any smartphone yet. The iPhone 7 isn’t far behind with 86 though. It’s likely to be a tight contest between the iPhone 7 and the Pixel here, just like it is between the iPhone and the Galaxy S7, so we’re calling it a tie for now. Winner: Tie (Pending further tests) Durability Apple iPhone 7 PlusMore Unless these phones are securely wrapped up in a case, neither are going to come off well in the event of a nasty fall. Glass and aluminum bodies aren’t designed to withstand much shock. It’s also worth mentioning that if you choose the jet black iPhone 7 and don’t wrap it in a case, expect it to gather up some scratches and scuffs pretty quickly. Apple knows the special finish is delicate, and recommends the use of a case. Apple now edges ahead of the Pixel here, having made the iPhone meet IP67 standards of splash, water, and dust resistance. We’ve tested this out, and the iPhone happily continues working after taking a bath, something the Pixel is unlikely to do even with its basic IP53 protection. Accidents happen, and if they involve the wet stuff, you’ll be glad it was the iPhone and not the Pixel underwater. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Software Google PixelMore If design was a difficult category to judge, due to personal preference playing a considerable role, software is also subjective. Unlike pitting a phone like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 against the Pixel, Apple is prompt and regular with its software updates, which matches how Google will react with its new Pixel devices. The Pixel comes with Android 7.1 installed, the very latest version of the operating system, which can’t (and won’t) be found in this form anywhere else. The Apple iPhone has iOS 10. The two are very different, yet also quite alike. There are icons to tap, a virtual assistant to help — Assistant on the Pixel and Siri on the iPhone — and special messaging apps for both. On the Pixel, it’s Duo for video calls and Allo for chats, while on the iPhone there’s FaceTime and iMessage. Downsides of Google’s operating system don’t really apply here. It’s going to get regular updates, there’s no messy user interface over the top, and you’re assured of the latest version for at least a few years yet. Apple treats the iPhone in the same way. There’s little to choose between them when it comes to app stores either, with both being equally well stocked with apps, books, movies, and more. Winner: Tie Pricing and availability Apple iPhone 7More Wallets at the ready? They better be, because you’re going to have to open them pretty wide to get either one of these phones. Unlocked, without a contract, the Pixel will cost you $650 for the 32GB model or $750 for the 128GB, and it can be purchased directly through the Google Play Store. The iPhone 7 also costs $650 for the 32GB, $750 for the 128GB, and then $850 for the 256GB model. It can be bought through the Apple Store, either online or in a retail store. Contract prices vary for the iPhone, but it’s available with each major carrier in the U.S., while the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive. This hurts the Pixel here. We don’t like being forced onto one carrier and many people buy their phones in stores. However, there is good news for the Pixel: You can buy it unlocked from Google and get the same month-to-month financing you get with the iPhone at carriers. We’d suggest not buying either phone locked to a network, or fixed into a contract, anyway. There are financing options available for both the Pixel and the iPhone 7 through Google and Apple respectively too. However, be aware if you choose an iPhone on AT&T or Sprint with financing through Apple, it’ll be locked to that network. International buyers will also find it easier to buy an iPhone 7, with 25 countries on the list at launch, and more than 30 having been added since then. Others are coming in October. Google is only selling the Pixel in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Germany at the moment. Wider availability, more carrier options, and equal pricing sees the iPhone take this category. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Overall winner: iPhone 7 (for now) It’s three category wins for the iPhone 7, and two for the Pixel, with three overall ties. However, two of those sections will likely have a different result when we’ve played with the Pixel for a longer amount of time, so there’s still everything to play for. It’s interesting to see where the iPhone 7 beats the Google Pixel, particularly because durability and price have long been problem areas for Apple, and winners for Android phones. Apple has turned that around with the iPhone 7. The Pixel has it beaten when it comes to display, battery, and the presence of a 3.5mm headphone socket. Right now, because you can buy it in more places, with fewer restrictions, and it won’t stop working if it gets wet, the iPhone 7 has to take the win. Don’t dismiss the Pixel yet though, we’ve yet to test out two areas where it could very easily fight back and take the win. Check back soon.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel phone carrier details and pricing review Chris Burns - Oct 7, 2016 4 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Today we’re having a very brief and simple look at the various ways in which a person might purchase and utilize a Google Pixel or Google Pixel XL smartphone. There aren’t a whole lot of options, at first glance – Verizon even seems to be pushing the idea that they will be the sole carrier option for the smartphone, the only place a person will be able to buy from! But they’re not. And it’s not. Google has made this decision very simple for people that check news and review sources like SlashGear before they buy. Point 1: do not buy directly from Verizon [UPDATE: maybe do!] Even if I planned on purchasing a Pixel or Pixel XL to use with my Verizon SIM card, I would not purchase it directly from Verizon. The one reason for this is, while I don’t assume I’ll get updates forever, I still want them for as long as possible, and as quick as possible. • Google handles and delivers Android security patches • Google delivers OS updates, but only at first… Google delivers OS updates to Verizon. Verizon then takes those updates and puts the update through a certification process, which – as we know – can take a while. Or perhaps Verizon has streamlined their process. You never know.* But why take the chance? *We do know now – or at least Verizon has made a promise. Updates at the same time regardless of if we purchased the device with Verizon or Google. How about that? Google’s goal in working with Verizon was and is to have it available in the United States’ topmost used and visited wireless smart device carrier store. Some people, believe it or not, simply go to their wireless carrier and buy a new phone when they need one, no research done, completely dependent on the store employees themselves. That’s a real thing. That really happens. As such, Google needs the shelf space Verizon can provide, as well as the pocketbooks that are only opened in Verizon stores nationwide. Point 2: Google has the same device The Google Store online has the exact same device as Verizon. Not just a slightly different bit of hardware with different branding. Literally the same hardware. This is made possible by Qualcomm, which delivers technology which allows any of the carriers in the USA (and most/all outside the USA) to pop in a SIM card and go. The only differences between the Verizon-sold and Google-sold versions of the device are the following: • Verizon has a trade-in program where my old phone could be worth up to $300. Or I could sell that phone basically anywhere else and more than likely get more than Verizon could give me. • Neither version has preloaded apps from Verizon. There are three apps from Verizon which will automatically install themselves from the Google Play app store once a device is activated with a Verizon SIM card, but they’ll all immediately be able to be uninstalled, easy peasy. • The Verizon-sold Pixel has ONE software difference right out the gate – its bootloader is encrypted. If I didn’t ever want to modify the software of the Pixel at a ROM-level, I wouldn’t worry about this. But I’d like the option, especially since… Point 3: Both Google and Verizon’s Pixel cost the same If I buy the Pixel from Google it’ll be $650 or $27 a month. It’s the same pricing from Verizon*, and both stores have free shipping. *Except Verizon adds a $20 activation fee. Google and Verizon also have their own “protection plans”. Google’s Protection Plan costs either $79 or $99 for 2-years of coverage and Verizon’s Protection Plan costs $11 a month (that’s $264 for two years). Point 4: Freebie VR! Both the Verizon-sold and the Google-sold Pixel and Pixel XL include a free Daydream View VR headset. Google is really pushing the Daydream with this release – really, really pushing it hard. Sound like a good deal? Find the Pixel in the Google Store online and use the SIM card you already have. Even if it’s from Verizon. Or AT&T, T-Mobile USA, or anyone else.

 More software engineers over age 40 may join a lawsuit against Google Julie Bort Oct. 7, 2016, 3:53 PM 35,329 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty / Justin Sullivan Google suffered a setback in an age discrimination suit this week. A judge ruled that other software engineers over age 40 who interviewed with the company but didn't get hired can step forward and join the lawsuit. The suit was brought by two job applicants, both over the age of 40, who interviewed but weren't offered jobs. Specifically, the judge has approved turning the suit into a "collective action" meaning that people who "interviewed in person with Google for a software engineer, site reliability engineer, or systems engineer position when they were 40 years old or older, and received notice on or after August 28, 2014, that they were refused employment, will have an opportunity to join in the collective action against Google," the ruling says.  While this isn't good news for Google, the ruling was strictly focused on whether the suit could be broadened to include more people. It doesn't meant that Google will ultimately lose the case. Google says it's fighting the suit. A spokesperson told us, "We believe the allegations here are without merit and we will continue to defend our position vigorously. We have strong policies against discrimination on any unlawful basis, including age." Interestingly, the judge is particularly not buying that "policies" defense from Google, writing in the ruling:  "Having such a policy does not necessarily shield a company from a discrimination suit, particularly in light of the evidence and allegations presented here ... today, most, if not all, companies are well versed in anti-discrimination and make great efforts to ensure their written policies comply with anti-discrimination law." In terms of allegations, one of the plaintiffs alleged that a Google recruiter told her she needed to puts the dates of her graduation on her resume so interviewers could determine her age. That same plaintiff argued that she had found seven others who say they had similar experiences at Google. She also presented evidence to the court that the median age of Google's workforce is 29 while the median age in the US for programmers is 42.8 years old. How old are Google employees? Google has about 61,000 employees and we asked Google if the company has publicly released statistics on its median age. Age is not included with the company's published diversity report, which discusses sex and race. Google didn't respond. Father of the Internet and Google employee Vint Cerf is one example of the Google's "Greyglers" group Google However, we do know that Google has a diversity club on campus called "Greyglers" which is for Googler employees over 40. The company describes it as a group for "company elders" that helps the company with "promoting age diversity awareness." The company was sued way back in 2004 for age discrimination and, after winding through the appeals system, the case was ultimately settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Still, just allowing people who went on job interviews but didn't get a job to join a suit is a startling turn of events.  Some folks on Hacker News, a site where programmers discuss news items of interest to them, worry that instead of solving the tech industry's age discrimination problem, it will make it worse. One wrote:  "Fallout from this: Companies will go to great lengths to avoid contact with people who submit resumes that imply they are old. No phone screens, no responses. It's going to be wintertime for folks in their late 30s now."

Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Videos About en de es fr it nl pt The VICE Channels Share Tweet Motherboard Motherboard Watch Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Latest Videos Documentaries Interviews Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Follow Motherboard Newsletter Image: Wiyada/Shutterstock Thanks To Encryption, Governments Need Companies Like Yahoo To Spy on Users Written by Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai Staff Writer October 7, 2016 // 03:41 PM EST Copy This URL Last year, the US government asked Yahoo to scan all its customers emails to look for the digital “signature” of certain method of communication used by a terrorist group. The secret scanning tool rocked the tech world and that of privacy and anti-surveillance activists this week, shocked by how broad the request was, and the fact that it had kept under wraps. Until Reuters reported its existence this week, the tool remained a secret not just to the public, but also to most people at Yahoo, including the security team, which caught it and thought it was a sophisticated and dangerous piece of malware installed by hackers, as reported by Motherboard on Friday. Read more: A Frustrating Conversation About Privacy With Google's New Allo Chatbot In an age where the FBI asked Apple to unlock the iPhone of a dead terrorist, and countless top secret documents revealed the vast surveillance powers of the NSA, asking Yahoo to use a scanning tool that former employees defined as a “buggy” and a “poorly designed” “backdoor” or “rootkit,” was an unusual request as it wasn’t targeted—Yahoo was essentially looking through the whole haystack looking for a few needles—and the company apparently didn’t fight back. But such a request is a perfect example of how the rise of encryption technologies have changed the face of government surveillance. Before large tech companies such as Google and Yahoo turned on default encryption across their services, including email—in the process protecting their customers data as it travelled from their computers to the company’s servers, as well as when the data travelled through the internet—the NSA could’ve gone through users’ data without having to knock on Yahoo’s door. “Five years ago the government would’ve just done this by spying on international telecommunications traffic.” “Five years ago the government would’ve just done this by spying on international telecommunications traffic,” Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, told Motherboard. As revealed by documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the NSA and its British partner GCHQ have taps on the internet backbone infrastructure, and used to collect data directly from what they called “upstream” provides, none other than large ISPs. Before the Snowden revelations, when companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo, and other email providers didn’t use encryption, all these emails were travelling in the clear over the internet, and were collected by spy agencies. An illustration of how email travels across the internet, without STARTTLS. (Image: Riseup.net) Especially in the aftermath of the Snowden leaks, companies started adopting HTTPS, which encrypts connections between users and the server, and STARTTLS, which encrypts emails as they travel through the internet between providers. In 2014, Google reported that, for the prior year, only 33 percent of emails between Gmail and other providers were encrypted. The number rose to 58 percent in 2014, when major providers like Yahoo and Microsoft also adopted STARTTLS. Now, it’s almost pervasive, at more than 80 percent. An illustration of how email travels across the internet, with STARTTLS. (Image: Riseup.net) “Every time a provider turns on STARTTLS the NSA loses access to more and more email,” Soghoian told me. “NSA has lost a good percentage of its visibility into international email traffic without the help of tech companies.” Without the ability to just ingest emails travelling across the internet and looking through their content, the NSA has to ask the Yahoos, Googles and Microsofts of the world to do that for them now. In a way, this is the same issue the FBI and police are encountering when trying to break into iPhones, or intercepting end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp. The data is now encrypted, and without some help hacking in, there’s no way in.

Google launches Android Pay at 5,000 Hong Kong locations 20 Oct 2016 Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with US$3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple. Google’s launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign”. He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. The battle for smartphone supremacy: Google unveils new Pixel phone and VR headset to take on Apple and Amazon Wireless carrier Verizon Communications, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s October 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. “When you have an inferior brand, it’s OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you,” he said. “But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 3 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 Elon Musk’s surprise unveiling of Tesla’s ‘solar roof’ Shared 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 3 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 China’s giant FAST radio telescope to join hunt for extraterrestrial intelligence Commented 1 Beijing confirms it will interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy 2 Oath-row intervention reflects Beijing’s distrust of Hong Kong judges, lawyers say 3 Hong Kong charities, unions and political organisations refuse to ‘say no to shark’s fin’ 4 Taiwan calls on Beijing to reopen dialogue to pave way for peace deal 5 How did China’s Xi Jinping secure ‘core’ status in just four years?

Here Are 9 Other Products They Straight Up Ditched By Stephen Clark  |  October 7, 2016  |  2:30pm Tech Lists google Share Tweet Text This week Google has commandeered all the headlines in the tech world with its announcement of not just two new smartphones, but also a whole bevy of other devices along with it. While there’s plenty of reasons to be excited for the new Pixel phone, Google is quietly killing the Nexus phone program. The hardware in Nexus phones and tablets have always been based on a major manufacturer’s flagship device, which doesn’t make much sense under Google’s new unified Hardware Division. Adapting third party manufacturer hardware to create a reference spec may return someday, but it will probably not be given the Nexus name. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. The truth is when you have as much money as Google, you can afford to bet on longshots. For every wildly successful product like Gmail, there’s a Buzz or Wave. In some ways, there’s something refreshing about Google’s willingness to invest in ideas and give them up when they actually don’t make sense anymore. What happened to Google’s longshot hardware ideas? We take a look through the hardware and concepts that Google has abandoned over the years. 1. Nexus Q The Nexus Q was announced at the Google I/O Developers Conference in 2012. It impressed many with a wealth of input formats, high-quality audio output, and network connectivity. Some were given away at first, but for $299 customers expected more when compared to the $99 Apple TV. It was discontinued before launching and the niche was filled a year later by the more capable Chromecast at nearly one-tenth the price. 2. Nexus Player Google TV was built upon Android 3.2 Honeycomb, but never caught on. When they relaunched the effort as Android TV built on 6.0 Marshmallow, Google released reference hardware in the Nexus Player to promote the experience. At only $99, Google was now in direct competition with the Apple TV. It featured voice search and a more open architecture for app development. Less than two years later Google discontinued it and underwhelming sales may have been to blame. 3. Low Cost Tablets Google released announced the Nexus 7 tablet for only $199 packaged with free content and a $25 credit on the Google Play store. They followed it up with the Nexus 4, a phone which matched flagship specs but cost as little as $299. Both devices were less than half that of flagship devices from Apple or the other Android manufacturers. While we did eventually get the Nexus 5, we never got our update to the Nexus 7. There was a hardware update to the Nexus 7 but third party suppliers didn’t like Google undercutting them. 4. Play Edition Phones Back in 2013, Android had a serious fragmentation problem. Every major manufacturer had their own custom tweaks to the OS making an inconsistent experience for both users and developers. Along comes the Play Edition series. Google took the flagship smartphones from Samsung, HTC, Sony and Motorola (and a tablet from LG) and built the same basic Android experience on each that you get from the Nexus devices. They still were sold at premium prices so sales paled in comparison to the Nexus 4. Interest by the manufacturers quickly waned and the program was cut the next year. 5. Google Wallet Card Many Android smartphones have NFC chips for secure purchases, but they are by no means in all of them. When Google Wallet was launched in 2011 they also released a debit card letting you access your account wherever you could use plastic. Google eliminated support for the debit card in July of this year to focus on their rising competition, namely Apple Pay. 6. Google Search Appliance Put the power of Google on your internal corporate network. Just one box can give you Google-like access to up to 30 million documents. Including features we love like autocomplete and user profiles, and a catalog of up to 20 languages and hundreds of file formats. Support is destined to end by 2018 with no new hardware planned. Instead, Google is pushing towards cloud-based search making many system administrators uneasy. 7. Google Glass In what looked like an attempt to jump ahead several generations in personal computing, Google released a heads-up display that floats just in front of the user’s eyeball. Featuring a camera, microphone, and internet-connectivity, it was the general public’s worst privacy nightmare. The conspicuous design of the headware meant “Glassholes” could be easily spotted. It became clear the world wasn’t ready for Glass, but the project earned Google a wealth of patents. It still exists as a B2B solution, but is no longer available in the public marketplace. 8. Project Ara An ambitious project was intended as part of Google’s effort to get low-cost phones into developing markets. The plan was to sell a framework where cell phone components like processor, GPS, camera, screen and more could be swapped out. Each can be removed and upgraded without having to replace the whole phone. By the start of 2016 the project was modified to force certain core components into the non-upgradable framework. By September of the same year the project was shelved altogether. 9. Google Talking Shoes Technically more of an experiment than a product destined for market. Google played with interactive designers YesYesNo to give shoes motion sensors, internet-connectivity, and… a personality? The idea was to show what’s possible by giving technology some character. How would we interact differently if we felt judged by our footwear? Like a concept car, the technology may someday become a part of our lives but this shoe won’t be in stores any time soon.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently. But, maybe it doesn’t work super-great just yet. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Watch Google’s presentation from Tuesday, and read our roundup of everything that was announced. Read Brian Barrett’s story on Pixel’s place in the Android world. Margaret Rhodes on Google’s “Trojan Horse” plan for AI. This week, David recommends Keep, and Michael recommends the now-dirt-cheap Nexus 5X.

With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead. There’s some truth to that, though in reality, it just means that the industry is changing to meet new consumer demands. David and Michael discuss what needs to happen for the market to get more interesting. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: IDC numbers are bad. Canalys numbers are way better. David’s feature story about Fitbit’s quest to get more people wearing Fitbits. David again on smartwatches and fitness trackers. Recommendations this week: Authy and the Garmin Forerunner 735XT.

We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants. David’s recommendation this week is Poisonfeather by Matthew Fitzsimmons. Michael recommends Amanda yerba mate.

For now, some of us still need powerful PCs. This week, we got to see that Microsoft and Apple are still intent on wowing our socks off when it comes to hardware for developers and creative professionals. With the new Surface Studio from Microsoft and the redesigned MacBook Pro from Apple, we’ve got some great options. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Surface Studio looks hot. So does the new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. Also see David’s hands-on report. Margaret Rhodes has some additional thoughts on the Touch Bar as well. There’s also a new Surface Book from Microsoft. David’s recommendation this week is Lessons From the Screenplay. Michael’s is the Jaybird X3 sweat-proof wireless earphones.

The Pixel maybe just tipped the scales, and it did so right at the moment we’re getting ready to move on to something else. With so many voice-controlled, non-smartphone devices in our homes, it sure feels like we’re at a flux point. Also, the Google Assistant, which lives in the Pixel, is so so powerful, and we’re headed for more of that. Michael and David (who is back from Bogota) discuss the changes in the personal tech landscape. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David’s review of the Google Pixel. A gallery of the full-size images he shot with the phone in Colombia. Tim Moynihan’s story about the Pixel’s advanced camera technology. David’s recommendation this week is Textra, the best default messaging app for Android. Michael’s recommendation is Bob Dylan’s Planet Waves.

We bring in an expert, WIRED’s own Peter Rubin, to chart all of it. Peter manages WIRED’s culture and entertainment coverage and co-hosts The Monitor, our culture podcast. Peter is also well-steeped in face computers: he’s written stellar stories about Oculus and he’s been testing and ranking each new VR system as it’s released. With David out this week, Michael and Peter talk about PSVR, Google Daydream View, and the future of “untethered” real-deal VR. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Read Peter’s review of the Sony PlayStation VR headset and his report from last week’s Oculus Connect. Also, Chris Kohler writes about rhythm games and short-play games in VR. David Pierce has the details on Google’s phone-based Daydream View.

What we watch, what we watch it on, and what we do while we watch it. Not only is the technology of TV changing, but the content is morphing in a way that alters what we think of as “television.” Is a YouTube video TV? Sure, right. What about a Snapchat story, or a local city council meeting on Twitter? Yes—why not. The hosts discuss these changes in light of YouTube’s new app, Twitter’s new strategy, Snap’s new hardware, and Roku’s new future-proofed players. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David Pierce’s story on YouTube Go. The video from Vox about “the package” in Cuba. Brian Barrett on Snap Specs, and the WSJ feature that dropped suddenly. David also wrote about football on Twitter. Tim Moynihan’s rundown of the new boxes from Roku. David on Alto, the new email app from AOL. Easy, on Netflix.

The process model, i.e. how Firefox is split into various processes and how these processes interact between each other is common to all platforms. For more information see the Electrolysis wiki page. The security aspects of a sandboxed child process are implemented on a per-platform basis.

Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library: For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Build settings To disable building the sandbox completely build with this in your mozconfig: ac_add_options --disable-sandbox To disable just the content sandbox parts: ac_add_options --disable-content-sandbox Environment variables Disable content process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX Disable media plugin sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_GMP_SANDBOX Disable NPAPI process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_NPAPI_SANDBOX Allow weaker than default sandbox level MOZ_ALLOW_WEAKER_SANDBOX Enable sandbox logging MOZ_WIN_SANDBOX_LOGGING Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Overview Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Environment variables Enable sandbox logging MOZ_SANDBOX_VERBOSE Bug Lists Milestones Windows Content Process sbwc1 Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release. sbwc2 Roll out level 2 sandbox policy to release.

But privilege escalation via kernel vulnerabilities is relatively common, so we also use the seccomp-bpf system call filter to reduce the attack surface that a compromised content process can directly access.

The app will become part of GMS on December 1 and will replace Hangouts, will will become an optional GMS install. What this means is that, starting on December 1, manufacturers that want to install Google apps like Gmail and Google on their Android devices will also have to install Duo. This news shows that Google is really pushing Duo, hoping to make it the go-to video calling app for Android users. Making the app a required part of the GMS package will put Duo front and center on new Android phones, exposing it to millions of people that may not normally have known about it.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme No one should buy a Pixel smartphone from Verizon No one should buy a Pixel smartphone from Verizon By Joel Hruska on October 7, 2016 at 3:04 pm Comment Verizon is the major carrier partner for Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL. But that doesn’t mean it’s your only option for getting a device. Google will also sell Pixels directly from its own storefront — and if you care at all about system updates, unlocked bootloaders, or avoiding crapware, then the Google version of the device is the only one to buy. Granted, Verizon’s predatory business practices and relentless assault on customer privacy make it difficult for us to recommend buying anything from the company, but that’s something of a separate issue. First, here’s what Google has said on the topic. In an email to 9to5Google, the company writes: Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store. Verizon’s device has a locked bootloader, and comes with three pre-installed applications you don’t need — My Verizon, Go90 (a mobile TV app), and Verizon Messaging. The split between security updates and system updates means that while Google will guarantee you get your security updates, you won’t get newer versions of Android except on Verizon’s timeline — which basically means you won’t get new versions of Android until months later, if ever. Just because Google is handling security updates doesn’t mean those updates will continue to flow to older devices, mind you — over the past few years we’ve seen Google refuse to patch older versions of Android, even when failing to do so left hundreds of millions of devices vulnerable to known attacks. Regardless, if you plan to buy a Pixel and use it for more than 18 to 24 months, you should buy it from Google — that way you’ve got the best chance of getting both security and operating system updates in the future. Repeated studies have shown Apple does a better job than Google and the associated carriers do of keeping devices maintained. But Google Nexus products have typically been the best-supported over the long term of all Android devices. The Pixel is being advertised as a Verizon exclusive, but ignore that — the phone is actually widely available from major stores and outlets. Best Buy, Amazon, Target, and Google’s Project Fi all advertise the hardware, and the Pixel has been explicitly guaranteed to work on any US carrier. It’s not a Verizon-specific product, no matter what some of the ad copy says. So do yourself a favor and buy the unlocked Pixel, not the inferior Verizon-specific model.

Follow TechnoBuffalo In case you needed a reminder as to why an autonomous future is necessary and important, look no further than this report filed by Google. The search giant on Thursday released a report revealing one its self-driving cars was involved in an accident that sent the operator to the hospital. After a brief investigation, it was discovered the driver of a commercial van was found to be at fault after running a red light and t-boning Google’s self-driving car. According to Google, the autonomous vehicle noticed the van barreling toward it and slammed on the brakes, but not in time to avoid a collision. It’s unclear what caused the van to run the red light but it’s not far-fetched to think the driver may have been distracted. Whatever the cause, it underlines why autonomous technology could be a positive change for our roadways. Of course, autonomous technology isn’t without its faults. Earlier this year, one of Google’s self-driving cars caused an accident by changing lanes into a bus. That accident resulted in no major injuries. Meanwhile, a driver using Tesla’s prototype self-driving software was killed after he and the technology failed to avoid a truck that had turned into his path. Self-driving technology still needs a lot of work before it makes a significant impact on our daily lives. Until that happens, it’s clear that human drivers are susceptible to mistakes, which is why working toward an autonomous future is so important.

It has the “best smartphone camera ever” perhaps (that’s still yet to be officially determined, other than by DxOMark), there are some hardware optimizations, and the phone sports the super-new and super-fast Snapdragon 821. But other than that, Google is relying mostly on software to set this phone apart from the crowd. That’s fine by me, except for the fact that most of the software features Google is touting are only artificially exclusive to the Pixel. One of the most obvious is Assistant, Google’s AI-powered evolution of Google Now that the Mountain View company is putting in a lot of its new products. It’s built-in to Allo, it’s the central interface for Google Home, and of course, it’s front-and-center with a new home button on the Pixel phones. What frustrates me, though, is that there’s not really any reason other than helping push the Pixel out the door to hold it back from last year’s Nexus phones. Google, the company that has long pioneered Android as “open,” is closing some things off… This reminds me a lot of the launch of Siri on the iPhone 4S, which Apple famously touted as the big selling point of the phone — while holding the feature back from software updates to the iPhone 4. It was purely a software feature, and Apple used it as the central selling point. Perhaps this isn’t the best comparison, though, because the performance difference between iPhone 4 and 4S was a lot more substantial than, let’s say, the Nexus 6P and the Pixel XL. Apple might have had some justification for that decision. Google also has some justification, but it really comes only in the form of exclusivity and marketing. As our own Ben Schoon even admitted himself, a big reason he jumped on the Pixel bandwagon is because it just has lots of software exclusives that are hard to pass up. Assistant is the big one, but the Pixel and Pixel XL also offer 24/7 customer care, a lot of Android 7.1 features, the Pixel Launcher, and unlimited full quality photo and video backup with Google Photos. Some of these will eventually make their way to some of the newer Nexus devices, but for now, Google is using them to get you to spend $650+ on a phone that actually leaves a decent amount to be desired in the hardware department. The physical design isn’t exactly groundbreaking, there’s no waterproofing, there’s no OIS, there’s only one bottom-firing speaker… Perhaps the other justification Google has for limiting Assistant’s launch on older Nexus devices for the time being is to give it — and Google — a chance to learn some more and iron out some kinks before being pushed out to the “masses” (I put that in quotes because the number of people using Nexus devices is insanely small compared to the entire smartphone market). But I don’t really buy that, because Google already released Assistant publicly in the form of Allo. And anyone on any device — including iPhone — can download it and try it out right now. Rather, I think that Google wants its hardcore Nexus fanbase to help it promote the Pixel and get some sales moving out the gate. Honestly, if Google had released (or even directly promised) the Assistant in a software update — or even a developer preview — for the Nexus 6P and 5X, how many of Google’s most loyal fans who bought a Nexus last year would skip out on the Pixel and Pixel XL for now (or even entirely)? I think the number would be pretty decent. But it’s still annoying to me. Google has long trumpeted Android as an open platform and has never used software exclusivity to sell its hardware like this before. It’s a very Apple-like move, and only in the worst way. Google seems to be waking up to the fact that top-to-bottom control of its software and hardware will be the only way it can produce phones that have the “fit and finish” to compete well with the iPhone (although we aren’t really seeing the benefits of this with the Pixel, yet), but unfortunately they’re throwing long-time Nexus fans and loyalists under the bus in the process. Other than pushing sales of the Pixel, there’s no reason the Nexus 6P can’t have Assistant today. This has to be artificial for the most part, because even Google itself says that they want to allow 3rd-parties to put the Assistant on anything. “We imagine a future where the assistant will be able to help from any context and from any kind of device,” the company said at its event earlier this week. They even mentioned the eventual possibility that Assistant could run on a Raspberry Pi. And one of our anonymous tipsters (if you’re reading this, feel free to send us an anonymous encrypted email, we’d really love to chat), who has told us some things that ended up confirmed, also suggests that this is the case. We’re hearing from said tipster that internal developer Nexus devices have the Assistant running “perfectly” (The Verge also mentioned it running on the Nexus 6P in a lengthy feature). Further, this person confirms the obvious, saying that Google is holding it back for a some amount of time to give Pixel the exclusive. The Android 7.1 change log that Android Police obtained, however, clearly distinguishes which features are Pixel-exclusive. The developer preview for Android 7.1 is said to be coming at least to the 6P, 5X, and Pixel C, by the end of the year. Here’s what Google told us on the matter: There will be certain features — such as the Google Assistant — that will be unique to Pixel before we make a decision to offer it up to the rest of the ecosystem.  With some of these features currently unique to Pixel, we’re carefully experimenting with these changes to assess user reaction and feedback. So when and which devices in Google’s portfolio will get the Assistant is entirely up in the air for the moment. Which, I don’t know about you, is probably a sign of things to come. It’s clear that the Pixel line is going to basically have its own fork of Android (which, actually, was true of the Nexus phones as well considering they didn’t run technically pure “stock” AOSP). What’s confusing is that we’ve now heard of a couple cases where Google is considering Nexus-like devices. The Huawei tablet that we’ve (and Evan Blass, and some others) heard about is one of them (which likely won’t be Pixel-branded, as Huawei refused to let Google remove its branding for the Pixel), but Android Police also noted that Huawei is being “solicited by Google” to make a mid-range smartphone as well for launch next year. Assistant is probably just the first of many features that make up the “more opinionated” exclusives of the Pixel line, and while it’s exciting that Google is taking the bull by the horns and trying to deliver a unique and compelling top-to-bottom smartphone package, it’s also going to be unfortunate for those that want to stick with Android but would perhaps prefer hardware from other companies (or in this case, would like to stick with Google’s hardware from last year for a while).

By Andy Boxall — October 7, 2016 11:51 AM Subscribe to this topic Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Apple iPhone 7 MSRP $649.00 DT Recommended Product Learn More Look out Apple, Samsung, and just about every other smartphone maker out there, because Google’s coming for you with the new Pixel smartphones. There are two, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and they run the very latest version of Android, look super, and have some exclusive features to make sure smartphone fans sit up and take notice. They come just a few weeks after Apple’s latest iPhone models went on sale. Like the Pixel there are two different types, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and they both look great, have some special features not seen on other iPhones, and as always with an Apple launch, made people sit up and take notice. Related: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 — which 5-inch flagship is right for you? Inevitably, if you’re about to buy a new phone, these two will be on your list. The Pixel naturally goes up against the iPhone 7, so which one should you buy? Each phone has its own positive and negative points, and we’ve given them an thorough examination to find out which deserves your money. Google Pixel iPhone 7 Size 143.8 × 69.5 × 7.3 mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 in) 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 in) Weight 5.04 ounces (143 grams) 4.87 ounces (138 grams) Screen 5-inch AMOLED 4.7-inch Retina HD LED backlit screen Resolution 1,080 × 1,920 pixels (441 ppi) 1,334 x 750 pixels (326 ppi) OS Android 7.1 iOS 10 Storage 32, 128GB 32, 128, 256GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 A 10 Fusion with 64-bit architecture, M10 motion coprocessor RAM 4GB 2GB Connectivity 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi 4G LTE, GSM, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Camera 12.3MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 7MP front Video 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30, 60, or 120fps 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30 or 60fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Water resistant Yes, IP53 rated Yes, IP67 rated Battery 2,770mAh 1,960mAh Ports USB Type-C Lightning Marketplace Google Store Apple App Store Color offerings Blue, silver, black Black, Jet Black, gold, rose gold, silver Availability Verizon, Google Fi AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile Price $650 $650 DT review Hands-on  3.5 out of 5 stars Performance The Google Pixel is bang up to date with its processor. It uses the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, which is a small but significant update to the Snapdragon 820, seen in most major flagship phones released during 2016. The 64-bit Snapdragon 821 has four cores and gets a 10 percent performance bump over the already speedy Snapdragon 820, a 5 percent increase in graphical capabilities, is more energy efficient, and can use Quick Charge 3.0 for even faster battery recharging. Apple doesn’t use a Snapdragon chip, and instead uses the A10 Fusion chip of its own design. Apparently it’s 40 percent faster than the A9, according to Apple, and it’s the first time the company has used a quad-core chip. Both chips utilize the multiple cores in a similar way, splitting the workload across them to reduce power consumption during easy tasks. The Snapdragon 821 is so new, we’ve not seen a phone with it inside to test out yet, so establishing any of our own benchmarks is impossible. Early benchmark results seen in Geekbench 4 return a multi-core score of 4,089. The iPhone 7 managed 5,600. Does that make the Pixel a slowcoach? No, and we’re wary of that unconfirmed benchmark, as the Galaxy S7 regularly scores over 5,000, and it uses a Snapdragon 820 chip. At this early stage, we can’t say either phone is faster than the other. However, we know the iPhone 7 is quick, and have no reason to think the Snapdragon 821 will be any different. Elsewhere, the Pixel comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and doesn’t have a MicroSD card slot, sadly. The iPhone 7 adds a 256GB option to the list, so if masses of storage are important to you (and you can stomach the extra cost), the Apple phone has a slight advantage here. Winner: Tie (pending further tests) Design This is ultimately going to come down to personal preference, but there are a few things you should keep in mind as you size the two up. The Pixel is made of metal, glass, and plastic. The glass panel on the rear provides the antenna with room to breathe, while the plastic sections recall manufacturer HTC’s Desire range of phones. It’s thin at 7.1mm and light at 143 grams. For the iPhone 7, Apple has blended in the antenna breaks more than on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, decluttering the rear panel, but keeping the camera bump. Google has avoided this by slightly enlarging the body itself. The iPhone 7’s body is made from aluminum, is 7.1mm thick, and a little lighter than the Pixel at 138 grams. In our hands-on, the Pixel is described as being, “high-end, not too heavy, or fragile, even with the half-glass back.” Concerns over the screen bezel are also unfounded, with it appearing larger in pictures than in real life. The iPhone 7 is extremely comfortable to hold, with wonderfully curved sides, and corners that nestle in the palm nicely. Arguably, the Pixel looks a lot like an iPhone, but this doesn’t really bother us — both are great looking phones. Google gives you the choice of a white, black, or limited edition blue Pixel, and it’s the blue that really catches the eye. The iPhone 7’s jet black color is the elusive limited edition for showoffs, and it’s the regular matte black that’s the winner, as it neatly conceals the antenna lines for a smooth look. Google’s phones have never been stunners, while the iPhone 7 has a class that the Pixel can’t quite match, supreme in-hand comfort, and a real premium build, which along with its lighter body and wider choice of colors sees it edge out the Pixel here. Winner: iPhone 7 Battery and audio Google has selected a 2,770mAh battery for the Pixel, complete with fast charging provided by the Snapdragon 821 and Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 feature. Plug it in using the USB Type-C cable and after 15 minutes it’ll be at 70 percent capacity. We’ve not used the phone for long enough to judge the overall use time on a daily basis. Inside the iPhone 7 is a 1,960mAh battery and in our review, we have seen 12 hours of solid use, and more than 40 percent left at the end of a day. There’s no fast charging though, and recharging the iPhone 7 will take longer than the Pixel. Neither phone has wireless charging as standard. The iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, and audio performance is vastly improved over the iPhone 6S while the Pixel has a single downward firing speaker. However, the Pixel retains a 3.5mm headphone socket, while Apple forces you to use headphones with a Lightning connector or Bluetooth. More battery capacity, faster charging, and a traditional headphone socket make the Pixel a clear winner. Winner: Google Pixel Display Looking at the numbers, the Pixel should run away here. The 5-inch display is an AMOLED panel, therefore producing deep blacks and strong colors. It has a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution and a 441ppi pixel density, is covered in protective 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4, and Google claims it has an excellent viewing angle with little decrease in brightness. Related: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The iPhone’s Retina HD LED-backlit screen measures 4.7-inches, has a 1,334 x 750 pixel resolution for a 326ppi pixel density, and also a 2.5D piece of glass over the front. Although it has a lower resolution, it does still look great, but the Pixel’s AMOLED screen and higher pixel count will automatically make pictures, webpages, and games look better. However, there is one thing in the iPhone 7’s favor, and that’s 3D Touch, Apple’s pressure sensitive system. Here, additional functionality can be accessed with a harder screen press, and it’s surprisingly helpful, especially with iOS 10 installed. The Pixel doesn’t have this feature. Despite this, it’s as much a software feature as it is a display feature, giving the Pixel the win. Winner: Google Pixel Camera Let’s start with a spec shootout. The Pixel and the iPhone 7 both have 12-megapixel rear cameras. The Pixel has an f/2.0 aperture against the iPhone 7’s f/1.8 aperture, which should let in a little more light, plus it has a quad-LED flash rather than the Pixel’s dual-LED. However, while both have phase detection autofocus, laser autofocus only comes on the Pixel. Both have image stabilization, but only the iPhone uses traditional OIS, as the Pixel has a clever system that utilizes the phone’s gyroscope for smoothing out video. We’re big fans of the iPhone 7’s camera, although consider the iPhone 7 Plus to be the real winner, but have yet to really put the Pixel’s camera to the test. In our hands-on with the phone, we noted the speed with which it captured and processed photos, along with its low-light performance and cool HDR+ mode. The Pixel also has free, unlimited full resolution photo storage in the cloud through Google Photos, while you’ll have to pay for extra iCloud space or full-res Google Photos storage if you own an iPhone. Until we get our hands on the Pixel for a full review, we must turn to well-respected camera testers DxOMark, where the Pixel received an 89 rating, the highest of any smartphone yet. The iPhone 7 isn’t far behind with 86 though. It’s likely to be a tight contest between the iPhone 7 and the Pixel here, just like it is between the iPhone and the Galaxy S7, so we’re calling it a tie for now. Winner: Tie (Pending further tests) Durability Unless these phones are securely wrapped up in a case, neither are going to come off well in the event of a nasty fall. Glass and aluminum bodies aren’t designed to withstand much shock. It’s also worth mentioning that if you choose the jet black iPhone 7 and don’t wrap it in a case, expect it to gather up some scratches and scuffs pretty quickly. Apple knows the special finish is delicate, and recommends the use of a case. Apple now edges ahead of the Pixel here, having made the iPhone meet IP67 standards of splash, water, and dust resistance. We’ve tested this out, and the iPhone happily continues working after taking a bath, something the Pixel is unlikely to do even with its basic IP53 protection. Accidents happen, and if they involve the wet stuff, you’ll be glad it was the iPhone and not the Pixel underwater. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Software If design was a difficult category to judge, due to personal preference playing a considerable role, software is also subjective. Unlike pitting a phone like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 against the Pixel, Apple is prompt and regular with its software updates, which matches how Google will react with its new Pixel devices. The Pixel comes with Android 7.1 installed, the very latest version of the operating system, which can’t (and won’t) be found in this form anywhere else. The Apple iPhone has iOS 10. The two are very different, yet also quite alike. There are icons to tap, a virtual assistant to help — Assistant on the Pixel and Siri on the iPhone — and special messaging apps for both. On the Pixel, it’s Duo for video calls and Allo for chats, while on the iPhone there’s FaceTime and iMessage. Downsides of Google’s operating system don’t really apply here. It’s going to get regular updates, there’s no messy user interface over the top, and you’re assured of the latest version for at least a few years yet. Apple treats the iPhone in the same way. There’s little to choose between them when it comes to app stores either, with both being equally well stocked with apps, books, movies, and more. Winner: Tie Pricing and availability Wallets at the ready? They better be, because you’re going to have to open them pretty wide to get either one of these phones. Unlocked, without a contract, the Pixel will cost you $650 for the 32GB model or $750 for the 128GB, and it can be purchased directly through the Google Play Store. The iPhone 7 also costs $650 for the 32GB, $750 for the 128GB, and then $850 for the 256GB model. It can be bought through the Apple Store, either online or in a retail store. Contract prices vary for the iPhone, but it’s available with each major carrier in the U.S., while the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive. This hurts the Pixel here. We don’t like being forced onto one carrier and many people buy their phones in stores. However, there is good news for the Pixel: You can buy it unlocked from Google and get the same month-to-month financing you get with the iPhone at carriers. We’d suggest not buying either phone locked to a network, or fixed into a contract, anyway. There are financing options available for both the Pixel and the iPhone 7 through Google and Apple respectively too. However, be aware if you choose an iPhone on AT&T or Sprint with financing through Apple, it’ll be locked to that network. International buyers will also find it easier to buy an iPhone 7, with 25 countries on the list at launch, and more than 30 having been added since then. Others are coming in October. Google is only selling the Pixel in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Germany at the moment. Wider availability, more carrier options, and equal pricing sees the iPhone take this category. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Overall winner: iPhone 7 (for now) It’s three category wins for the iPhone 7, and two for the Pixel, with three overall ties. However, two of those sections will likely have a different result when we’ve played with the Pixel for a longer amount of time, so there’s still everything to play for. It’s interesting to see where the iPhone 7 beats the Google Pixel, particularly because durability and price have long been problem areas for Apple, and winners for Android phones. Apple has turned that around with the iPhone 7. The Pixel has it beaten when it comes to display, battery, and the presence of a 3.5mm headphone socket. Right now, because you can buy it in more places, with fewer restrictions, and it won’t stop working if it gets wet, the iPhone 7 has to take the win. Don’t dismiss the Pixel yet though, we’ve yet to test out two areas where it could very easily fight back and take the win. Check back soon.

Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Comes to Life With Google Tango Augmented Reality With augmented reality pegged as the next big thing in mobile apps, Google Tango will be a welcomed feature of the Phab 2 Pro smartphone. Here's how Tango separates the Phab 2 Pro from other smartphones. Google Tango Makes the Phab 2 Pro Interesting Support for Google Tango is the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro's main attraction. The feature is an augmented reality engine that uses the device's camera to see virtual elements over the real world. Better yet, Tango can measure objects and digitally visualize items and spaces to help users navigate in a house, factory or office. The Phab 2 Pro is the first smartphone to come with Tango, making it interesting to anyone interested in the future of augmented reality. The Display Is Huge To deliver a better Tango experience, Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro comes with a 6.4-inch screen. The display has a resolution of 2,560 by 1,440 pixels and can adjust to variable lighting conditions so it can still work outside in direct sunlight. The Phab 2 Pro will ship with one of the best (and most attractive) smartphone displays on the market. Camera Technology Is Solid The Phab 2 Pro comes with a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera to complement its 8-megapixel front-facing camera. It also has a third camera on the back (its sensor size hasn't been revealed) that helps the smartphone render 3D images. If Tango takes off, expect more smartphones to come with a three-camera array—and for sensors to load up on megapixels. Snapdragon 652 Optimized for Augmented Reality The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, which has less power than the Snapdragon 820 and 821 chips users would find in other Android-based handsets. However, Lenovo was quick to note that the Snapdragon 652 has been optimized to work with Tango, which stands in stark contrast to other processors. So, while the Phab 2 Pro's processor might not be as high-powered as some of those in other Android devices, it's required to get the most out of Tango. It Has a High-Capacity Big Battery With Turbo Charging Lenovo has kept quiet about how long its Phab 2 Pro's battery can last on a single charge, but expect it to hold up quite well. The smartphone will ship with a 4,050mAh battery, one of the largest cells on the market. In addition, Lenovo says the battery will come with turbocharging so users can get back to work more quickly. There's a Fingerprint Sensor for Security Lenovo hasn't forgotten about security in the Phab 2 Pro and will offer a fingerprint sensor on the rear of the device. While the company hasn't said whether the smartphone will come with hardware-based encryption, a fingerprint scanner will at least make it more difficult for hackers to get into the smartphone or make unauthorized payments through Android Pay. Few Apps Are Currently Available Since the Phab 2 Pro is the first smartphone to support Tango, it's perhaps no surprise that the Google Play marketplace has only a few apps that support the smartphone. In fact, as of this writing, the marketplace has just a little more than 20 Tango-ready apps available, including some that focus solely on gaming, such as Castle Defender. But it's a start. Available Apps Are Appealing In addition to interesting gaming apps, there are a few Tango-ready programs that might actually appeal to corporate users. For instance, one app, Tango MeasureIt, lets users measure the distance between real-life objects. Another, Tango Constructor, lets developers record and view 3D models of their surroundings from the handset. As more apps come online, it's likely that devices running the Tango AR environment will gain greater support from business users. The Storage and Memory Should Suffice The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro ships with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. While more storage would be good, it's the RAM that counts here. With 4GB of RAM, the Phab 2 Pro should be able to handle augmented reality apps with ease and simultaneously support other Android functions. Less RAM, and the Phab 2 Pro likely wouldn't offer a suitable Tango experience. Putting the Pricing Into Perspective Lenovo hasn't set a specific delivery date in November for the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Whenever it hits store shelves, look for the Phab 2 Pro to come unlocked in the United States and sell for $499. To put that into perspective, most other high-end devices, including Apple's iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, start at $649. 10 Features Samsung Should Build Into the Galaxy S8 Smartphone View Slideshow » Why DNS Servers Are an Unprotected Back Door into Your Network View Slideshow » 11 Revolutionary Advances in Wireless Tech in 2016 View Slideshow » Panasonic Updates Toughpad FZ-G1 With More Power, Longer Battery Life View Slideshow » Broadcom, Qualcomm Latest Acquirers in Busy Chip Space View Slideshow » Why Donald Trump and Silicon Valley Don't See Eye to Eye View Slideshow » CIOs Expect Steady Growth in Health Care IT Spending, Cyber-Threats View Slideshow » Ransomware Takes Off, Web Browsers Under Attack: Kaspersky Report View Slideshow » TrueOS Succeeds PC-BSD Desktop-Friendly Unix OS View Slideshow » Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro View Slideshow » View All Slideshows >   Google Tango, an augmented reality technology that helps devices "see" the world around them, is soon coming to store shelves. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, the first smartphone to run the Tango AR environment, is set to launch in November, Google has confirmed. The Phab 2 Pro was supposed to reach the market in the summer, but was pushed back twice—once to September and again to the "fall." Now that Lenovo's release plans have been revealed, it's time to take a closer look at the Phab 2 Pro. And at first glance, it seems like a winner. In addition to Tango support, which could appeal to consumers and enterprise users, the Lenovo smartphone comes with a 6.4-inch screen, three cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor optimized for Tango and ample storage. As time goes on and more AR apps come to the Google Play marketplace, the smartphone could prove even more useful. This slide show discusses the Phab 2 Pro's features and how the addition of AR technology makes the introduction of this smartphone so highly anticipated.                       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend                             Topics by Type Android Apple Cloud Database Developer Enterprise Apps Innovation IT Management   Mobile Networking PC Hardware Security Servers Small Business Storage Virtualization Articles by Type News & Analysis Slideshows Blogs Reviews Video   Contact Us About eWeek Sitemap Blogs Security Watch Upfront First Read Storage Station Careers Google Watch Special Features eWeekChat eWeek 30th Anniversary Cloud Backup Project Center Next Generation Firewall Project Center Big Data Analytics Project Center Research Center       Property of QuinStreet Enterprise.

Home, Google's new smart speaker, will be able to use voice to control Netflix and other video on Google's Chromecast streaming device. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Google is pretty serious about its plan to take over your home. The company on Tuesday offered more details on its smart speaker and home hub, Google Home, as an answer to Amazon's Echo speaker. But Google -- perhaps knowing that it's starting a little bit behind -- has been sure to hook the Home into Google's broader suite of services to make the concept of the smart home more affordable. Home will work with Google's Chromecast video and audio streaming devices -- $69 and $35, respectively -- so that customers can upgrade their current speakers and televisions with little fuss and not that much cash. When the whole system is in place, users can use their voices to call up YouTube videos on their televisions or ask for a specific song to play through their non-Google speakers. Home itself will also be able to play music. And the Google Assistant built into the speaker has been designed to be able to find the track you want even if you aren't sure of its name. On stage, Google Home was able to correctly pull up the song "Try Everything" by Shakira, after being asked to play "the Shakira song from 'Zootopia'" -- a way of phrasing the query that could sound incomprehensible to a computer that can't tap into the wider world of Google's information. Home is also designed to work with third-party apps, so it will be able to control some smart light bulb systems such as Philips Hue. Google has also worked out partnerships with some services -- including Uber, meaning users can order a car by voice. And the hub has a mute button, if consumers aren't comfortable having the device always listening for the trigger phrase, "Ok, Google." Home comes in six shades -- copper, snow, carbon, mango, marine and violet -- and costs $129. It will be available at the Google Store, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target starting Oct. 20 and is available for pre-order immediately. The company also announced a new system of routers, called Google Wi-Fi. It's a pack of smaller routers that work together, rather than a single router that plugs into your modem. This should help eliminate "dead spots" in your house, by letting you place them more widely throughout your home. It will cost $129 for a single router and $299 for a three-pack. It will be available for pre-order in November at the Google Store, Amazon, Best Buy and Wal-Mart.

No, neither do we. Reports on Friday revealed Google is willing to cast off its largely unloved universal chat app in favour of the new and improved Duo video calling app. Google is no longer requiring Android phone makers to include Hangouts on their Google Mobile Services-approved phones. Its place will be taken by Duo, per AndroidPolice sources. Related: Google Pixel hands-on - the ultimate small phone? “Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016,” Google told hardware makers. Hangouts, which includes instant messaging, voice and group video chatting will be relegated to an optional extra for manufacturers and will remain available via the Play Store. Interestingly, although Duo will be a mandatory inclusion for Android phone-makers down the line, the Allo chat app, powered by Google Assistant, will not. As the original source points out, Allo has a huge number of competitors in the field, namely Facebook’s Messenger and WhatsApp. See also: Google Allo tips and tricks With that in mind, it is strange Google wouldn’t give it a leg up by ensuring it arrives on all Android Phones, so perhaps this will change in future.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Google starts big advertising push around new Pixel phone By Reuters Published: 14:06 EST, 7 October 2016 | Updated: 14:06 EST, 7 October 2016 e-mail By Jessica Toonkel and Julia Love Oct 7 (Reuters) - Google's new "Pixel" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc . Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL Smartphones – Things Everyone Should Know About the Phones By AdminOctober 7, 2016 Newest No Comments 0 0 0 October 14th 2016  – Google unleashed the new information about its first ever smartphone PIXEL and PIXEL XL – the next step in Google’s in-house hardware development. Google markets the phones as a strictly in-house operation, despite HTC constructing the phones. Pixel costs same as much as the other new phones  The price of the pixel starts at $649 same as the new I Phone 7 and it is slight cheaper than the samsung S7 at $670 Google announced that the pre-order of Pixel and Pixel XL smart phones start at October 13th in India and it will be also available in small retailers and Flipkart, Reliance Digital and croma. Google Pixel Price                   India                 US  Google Pixel 32GB                   57000               $649 Google Pixel 128GB                 66000               $749 Google Pixel XL 32GB              67000               $769 Google Pixel XL 128GB            76000               $869 It has the best camera of any smartphone Google proudly touted this fact in most of the Pixel’s marketing. DxOMark gave the camera a score of 89, the highest in the industry. Apple’s iPhone 7 scores at 86. The camera boasts blur reduction, stabilizers, fisheye panoramas, and “photosphere” capabilities. The Pixel Smartburst feature allows users to take photos in rapid succession so as to not miss any of the action. Google Assistant keeps your life together Pixel is the first phone to feature Google Assistant built into the programming (duh, since it’s a Google phone). The Assistant can access photos from both personal storage and the internet. The Assistant translates across devices and into the Google Home system. Holding the Pixel’s home button activates the assistant. With the entire power of Google’s search engine, the assistant can access pretty much everything users need. It offers unlimited photo and video storage for its devices. Included with the phone is free unlimited storage for high-resolution images and video. The storage even takes off size limitations and compression issues users currently experience uploading to Google Photos. Google Pixel specifications The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, with two cores clocked at 1.6GHz, and two cores clocked at 2.15GHz. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will pack 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and sport Pixel imprint fingerprint sensor. They sport a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX378 sensor, PDAF, a large f/2.0 aperture, and 1.55-micron pixels. Both sport an 8-megapixel front camera with a Sony IMX179 sensor, an f/2.4 aperture, and 1.4-micron pixels.

The change is bound to be confusing for some users: When Google first introduced its Chromecast streaming adapter in 2013, it also released a Chromecast-branded companion app for iOS and Android that could be used to install and configure the device. Earlier this year, the company changed the app’s name to “Google Cast” in a nod to the fact that there are now numerous other devices that support Google’s cast technology, including TVs from Vizio and Wifi-connected speakers from LG, Sony and other companies. Now, the company is rebranding the app again, and simply calling it Google Home. Consumers will be able to use the app to “discover new content and manage (their) Google Home assistant and Cast devices,” according to Google. Google officially launched Google Home as its answer to Amazon’s Echo smart speaker earlier this week. During a press event in San Francisco, a Google employee showed that Google Home owners will be able to use the new app to select sources for their daily news briefing, connect to other devices around the home and more.

(Reuters/Mark Blinch) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging October 07, 2016 Becoming internet-famous may seem quick and easy, but it certainly doesn’t come cheap. José Javier, a 12-year-old trumpet player in Spain, decided to promote his band, Los Salerosos, through his YouTube channel—and found himself stuck with a €100,000 ($112,000) bill from Google, El País reported (link in Spanish). The schoolboy had signed up for Google AdWords, thinking that he would earn money every time someone clicked on his ad (as users can with Google’s AdSense program). Little did he know that it is the ad’s creator who foots the bill under AdWords’ “pay-per-user” program, which gives publishers the means to pay for priority placements of ads on the site. It’s apparently a common enough confusion that Google has a page explaining the difference between AdWords and AdSense. For the aspiring YouTube star from Valencia’s Torrevieja region, this was an expensive mistake: It only took a couple of months, mid-August to early October, to rack up the astronomical bill. His mother, Inma Quesada, was caught off guard when the family’s bank raised red flags about a €19,700 charge from Google in early September. Javier’s parents put a block on the account, but that didn’t stop the search engine giant from billing another €78,000. Quesada told El País that Javier was able to set up the Google AdWords account by giving just the name and account number of the savings account his family had set up for future costs like his driving license. Luckily for the young Spaniard, Google investigated the curious case after reports surfaced in the local media. Recognizing his youthful mistake, they wrote off the entire amount on Wednesday (Oct. 5). “We have not received any monies from this user and we are canceling the outstanding AdWords balance,” a Google spokesperson told Quartz. AdWords, like many of the company’s online services, has age limits restricting its use, but the company made a one-off concession this time to cancel the bill. The spokesperson recommended that families look to Google’s Safety Center page for families to prevent their kids from making such errors.

Google has an impressive record on renaming, so these moves are nothing new. The fact that the rebranding confuses the workers who need the tools doesn't seem to slow the name game down. Google Apps for Work also got a new moniker. Now called the G Suite, it pulls together Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Hangouts and other productivity tools. Previous names of this group of apps reads like a tech version of the name game: Google Apps, Google Apps for Work and Google Apps for Your Domain and now, G Suite. New, 'Smarter' G Suite Functionality While Google has been talking about the rebranding for a number of weeks now, it never explained why or if any additional apps would come with the new name. Currently the rebranding exercise is being regarded as exactly that — a rebranding exercise. While no new apps were included, G Suite does come with new functionality, which fall under the following categories — all with the prefix ‘smarter’: Storage Scheduling Spreadsheets Presentations Documents Drive for teams Meetings for teams In a blog post about the name change and improvements, Prabhakar Raghavan, vice president Apps, Google Cloud wrote: “Google has been driving machine intelligence research for over a decade. A year ago, Smart Reply launched, offering auto-generated replies for emails that only need a quick response. Now, more than 10 percent of all replies on mobile are sent using Smart Reply. The reception has been so strong that we're continuing to apply machine intelligence across our suite to solve customer problems.” The response has been generally positive, with some noting the enhanced collaboration features across the suite. Ragahavan cited research which found workers spend up to three work days on mundane tasks like emailing, scheduling and attending meetings and gathering information, and only two days doing what they were hired to do. G Suite, he writes, will “help employees reclaim their time and come together as teams on strategic and creative projects so they can better serve their customers.” The new functionality will become available over the coming weeks and months. AIIM Underlines Paper Problems Recently released research from Silver Spring, Md.-based Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM) shows paper is still clogging up the enterprise. The results shouldn't come as a surprise. Over the past 10 years report after report from organizations like AIIM and Gartner have underscored the difficulties organizations face when moving to paperless environments. AIIM released the findings in advance of the Nov. 4 observation of World Paper Free Day (WPFD). The research does indicate that significant progress has been made in the ongoing move towards a paper-free office. The research also shows a steady drop in the amount of paper entering the organization for 44 percent of respondents and a rapid drop for 9 percent. The "Paper-Free in 2016, Are We There Yet?" report is a result of an August survey of 199 members of the AIIM community. “The once elusive concept of paper-free business operations is today a real possibility and real progress has been made over the past 12 months. It remains unrealistic to think that all business processes and transactions will be paper-free in the near future, but there are definitely certain processes where paper can be removed,” Bob Larrivee, chief analyst at AIIM said in a statement. It points to a number of processes and business functions that have been particularly effective in reducing the use of paper, notably human resources and recruitment (49 percent). Other areas include: Employee lifecycle (48 percent) Accounts Payables (41 percent) Accounts Receivables (39 percent). But at the end of the day, people and their paper-loving ways remains the main problem. Note taking (47 percent) and lack of C-Suite initiatives (47 percent) are the biggest offenders, while 39 percent said they weren’t aware of paper free options.  M-Files Research Confirms Paper Problems The AIIM report findings were confirmed by research from Dallas-based M-Files, which also appeared in the past week. The results show 81 percent of the hundreds of workers surveyed online by M-Files are carrying out at least one print job per day. More importantly, it also shows that more than half of all organizations (55 percent) are still using manual paper-based processes for capturing signatures for documents that require approval. The good news here is that a similar number of respondents (55 percent) said the organization they work in is actively trying to reduce the dependency on paper. "Managing paper documents is inconvenient and expensive. Turning paper documents into digital files leads to a substantial increase in efficiency and reduced operational costs. It's really past time for companies to move beyond paper documents and bulky file cabinets as the default approach for managing important business documents,” Greg Milliken, vice president of marketing at M-Files Corporation, said in a statement.  OpenText Upgrades Exstream Waterloo, Ontario-based OpenText released the latest version of OpenText Exstream which, according to the company, will help organizations with digital transformation projects. OpenText acquired Exstream as part of its HP buy back in June and folded the software into its Customer Experience Management suite. The updated Exstream provides personalized, consistent, anytime/anywhere communications across channels and content forms including interactive charts, perform controlled in-context editing, and better PDF management. With this update, users can create mobile-ready content for HTML email output which incorporate responsive features. The in-context editing is particularly useful here for workers building and editing documents for email, PDFs or print The update also provides internal support for internal PDF hyperlinks and page dictionaries, while the dictionary indexing allows for dynamically importing HTML with formatted text, tables, images and variable content.  Title image "Hello My Name Is" (CC BY 2.0) by Photographing Travis 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Kentico’s New Cloud CMS Is Headless, Thoughtful and Affordable Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Domo Strikes New Low in Vendor Competition Everything You Thought You Knew About User Experience Is Wrong 5 Places Where Social Collaboration Tools Help Business Processes Digital Hub Platforms Can Improve Enterprise Collaboration Microsoft Connects SharePoint Team Sites to Office 365 Groups 3 Things to Know Before You Hire Across State Lines Microsoft Teams Takes Aim at Slack, Other Collaboration Vendors Useful Article?

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Captcha Does Not Block Pokemon Go Scanners, New Encryption Does Posted: Oct 7 2016, 10:30am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Oct 8 2016, 12:50am CDT, in News | Technology News   Credit: Google   Niantic deployment of Google's reCaptcha is not stopping 3rd party developers from scraping Pokemon Go servers. Update: Niantic deployed new encryption blocking all Pokemon scanners and bots. Pokemon Go is putting the spotlight on how weak widely used security technology really is. Niantic has enlisted Google security technology to block 3rd party developers from accessing Pokemon Go servers and extract the valuable location of spawning Pokemon. In addition to that, Niantic also relies on Google's SafetyNet to block the Pokemon Go app from running on rooted devices. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals Update: Niantic has released a new encryption of the protocol blocking all scrapers. It is not just Captcha now the 3rd party developers such as the creator of FastPokeMap have to deal with now. It is another reverse engineering job. They need to find out how the new encryption works before any Pokemon Go scanner or bot is going to work again. This can take days. Both security technologies can be circumvented. Running apps on rooted devices that require SafetyNet verification as been possible before Pokemon Go. Before solutions that hide rooted have been known by relatively small group, now millions more use these techniques so they can run Pokemon on their rooted smartphone.  This attention and wide spread forces Google to improve their security technology. This happened earlier this week with SafetyNet. Solutions like Magisk stopped working. This changed has not just affected Pokemon Go trainers, but anyone who was running Magisk for instance to use Android Pay on rooted phone. There are already methods to circumvent the new improved SafetyNet and Magisk is getting an update that will deal with the changes. This means there will be another round of SafetyNet changes coming soon. Google can't give up the fight. Business partners including banks will come down on them. They already will have increased the pressure on Google.     The situation with reCaptcha is no different. Yesterday we reported that FastPokeMap, the largest Pokemon scanner, is going to fold, but things already changed. The creator of FastPokeMap found a viable solution to deal with the Captcha. First he increased the number of worker accounts significantly from the 500,000 the service used. This reduces the number of captchas FPM triggers. Yesterday they still had 10,000 captchas per second. Secondly, they made a deal with a Captcha solving service to solve the captchas they hit. The end solution is to redirect the captchas to the 15 million daily users of FastPokeMap. This is not trivial and will take some hacking. Captcha solver and captcha solving services have been around since a long time, but now they get a lot of attention becaues of Pokemon Go. Not just large scale scanners have to deal with captchas. Anybody who is running a personal scanner or bot needs to deal with them and they do with similar methods as FPM. The fact that you can circumvent Google's reCaptcha with a "earn money online" service scheme makes Google look bad. Pokemon Go is going to make the web more secure by forcing Google to make its security solutions better. Banking and online payment services should lead that charge and not a game.

MobileSyrup October 7, 2016 10:00am On this episode of the SyrupCast we talk about the first smartphone built from the ground up by Google, the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as Rogers’ new worry-free data management feature. Rose Behar, Zach Gilbert, and Patrick O’Rourke join Igor Bonifacic to discuss their hot takes on Google’s devices and ask the question, is Google becoming more like Apple? Rogers has also introduced a worry free data management tool that allows the telecom’s customers to assert control over their data usage. Will control be the key to customers being comfortable spending more on their phone bills? Tune in to hear the SyrupCast team’s thoughts.

Smanny As far as why they made the Pixel with a big chin is exactly for symmetry. You guys didn’t even mention anything about the Pixels Daydream VR. It has to sit in a VR headset, so the screen has to be in the middle, and the headset needs to hold onto something. Plus Samsung has their own Gear VR and they are partnered with Oculus. Google started the whole mobile VR back in 2013 with their Cardboard. They needed someone to showcase their Daydream VR. So that is what the Pixel is exactly doing. Not to mention showcase their new camera software which uses the same VR sensors for image stabilization. They are using the fastest gyroscope and accelerometer sensors on any smartphone. A tech blog was saying that they can acquire 200 samples per second, which brings down latency and improves image stabilization, plus those sensors help out in VR as well. This time Google had to take the matters into their own hands. Because the software needed to have specific hardware, cpu, gpu, and sensors as well. Does anyone think that Google honestly wants to see any fragmentation. Absolutely not. You have to remember that if an OEM keeps updating a device for the next 5 years. They they will be loosing money, especially if you only paid $200 for a device (purchased outright). Mawhayden Interest in the Phone not the VR, VR will come 1st to the home,VR mobile is it really ready…maybe in5 years but not now. Smanny It certainly won’t be 5 years from now. VR is here today, and especially in mobile. The mobile processors today already can handle VR. From games to education, to movies, and videos. For instance the PS VR can and does already work perfectly for two displays (TV and VR headset). The mobile versions only needs to worry about feeding one display, only. The reason why the newer PS/4 is going to be 4 teraflops is so it can support multiple VR headsets simultaneously. Mobile devices (smartphones) will never have to worry about driving more than one display. Mawhayden Nah, I will pass, I will leave those toys to the “Younglings, I will choose 5G Technologies, Fibre Tech, advanced materials and advanced Mesh Networks, I willleave VR to you,you are more interested in this than I am have fun though. Not for you Nice to hear a discussion about the impacts on new services due to the lack of diversity amongst those who build them.
