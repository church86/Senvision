REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach/File Photo SAN FRANCISCO—Alphabet's Google is redoubling efforts to help developers of Android mobile apps build their businesses as concerns mount that the app economy has reached saturation. Under the leadership of Sameer Samat, who rejoined Google earlier this year after a spell as president of wearable tech firm Jawbone, the company is sharpening Google Play store recommendations with artificial intelligence and expanding support for various payment platforms, among other initiatives. Google's efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple Inc, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers. Both companies face a chorus of complaints from developers who say they are struggling to stand out in a jam-packed field. Many smartphone users, meanwhile, appear to have tired of downloading apps altogether, especially as messaging services like Snapchat perform more of the functions that once required a separate app. Games remain a focus of the Google Play store, and Nintendo Co Ltd is building a version of its popular Super Mario Run game for Android, said Samat, who leads product management for the Google Play store. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google's Chromebook laptops. "What we are excited about is giving developers that single entry point for more and more of the computing ecosystem," said Samat. Android wild west Google has eased the once-complicated process of developing apps for the Play store, said James Knight, a former Google employee who launched Pembroke, a consultancy that helps developers convert Apple-compatible iOS apps to the Android operating system. "The App Store has historically been a little more straightforward, and Android has been a bit more like the Wild West," he said. Mirroring the larger smartphone market, the Google Play store sees far more activity by virtue of its placement on the wide range of devices running the Android operating system—but Apple claims more of the profits. The Google Play store accounted for 70 percent of app downloads in the third quarter of this year, but Apple's App Store logged 65 percent of the revenue, according to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm. A big part of Google's new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone. The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing, a popular payment method in emerging markets where consumers often do not have credit cards. Google now offers the payment method in 47 markets. To improve app recommendations for users, the Play store has also made extensive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that gleans insights from vast troves of data. Google's Play store and machine learning teams began collaborating three years ago, and a partnership was struck last year with Google Brain, a cutting-edge research project. The jolt of artificial intelligence is welcome as developers hunt for an audience for their apps, said Greg Cohn, chief executive of Burner, which makes an app that provides temporary phone numbers. "The harsh reality is that there are a few apps that get the vast majority of people's time and attention," he said.

Independent Political Report Covering third parties and independent candidates since 2008 Menu Skip to content Home About IPR Traffic Court Advertising At IPR DMCA Removal RSS Search Social Networks Subscribe To IPR Chuck Moulton Reports LP.org Website Transition has 83% Data Loss 50 Replies From Moulton and Flood to Ludlow copied to LNC Business List: Kevin, Glad to help! Obviously, it is much easier for you to see what redirects need to be made, as you have access to the old website, the new website, and the 404 logs. However, you seem to be having trouble with this, so I’ll provide you with the information you need. It would be very difficult to compile a list of all incoming links to lp.org without access to the server logs. Therefore, I used Google’s search results, which is a reasonable proxy for outside links. I searched for “site:lp.org”, then I did followup searches for all directories I found with “site:lp.org inurl:lp.org/blog” (for example) because Google does not list all the results it has indexed without narrow searches. This netted 2,531 unique URLs indexed by Google. I wrote a program in Python to scrape that information. Next, Stewart Flood wrote a Perl program to check every URL on my list and find out whether it threw a 404 error. (He also checked for load times and other information, which we will highlight in a subsequent report.) Sorry this took so long… Stewart was busy watching the World Series. We re-ran the script several times this week to see if staff added any redirects… they only added one page: /contribute. The program can be re-run at any time to track what’s been added. Not all of the missing URLs should necessarily be carried forward, but a lot of historical information is no longer present. Our results are included in the attachments. (Note: In the summary page, these are groupings by directory, not the actual URLs.) Basically, 83% of the webpages indexed by Google have not been carried over or properly redirected.

Stewart Flood November 6, 2016 at 20:04 Many of the lost pages are from this year. We seem to have an interesting, but selective memory. Caryn Ann Harlos Post authorNovember 6, 2016 at 21:08 However, the website is beautiful, IMHO. Matt November 6, 2016 at 21:13 They fixed what wasn’t broken, and now they’re too broken to fix it. Thomas Knapp November 6, 2016 at 21:40 Apart from the web site, I do hope that the LNC will take the opportunity in this coming term to get rid of that idiotic looking banana peel and go back to a real logo. Austin Cassidy November 6, 2016 at 23:05 The “hand banana” logo has gotta go. https://youtu.be/k5n351OsuAE rob November 7, 2016 at 00:02 I said this would happen. Matt November 7, 2016 at 17:21 I wasn’t a big fan of the new logo, but it doesn’t bother me nearly as much after some getting used to. It was still a waste of time at best, though. The new website, particularly at the most critical possible time, is actually actively hurting the party, especially with the load times, lack of previously available information, and all the 404 errors hurting the site’s search rankings and credibility. Thomas Knapp November 7, 2016 at 18:20 Matt, It’s not so much that the new logo is memorable only for being incredibly ugly and uncommunicative of any information whatsoever, although that’s true. It’s also that the new logo replaced more than 40 years of insanely great branding. The Statue of Liberty was instantly recognizable and, to the extent that the LP was known by people, closely tied to it in imagery. Austin Cassidy November 7, 2016 at 19:03 Matt, What about the horrible yellow and gray colors? Ugh… it drives me nuts. Andy November 7, 2016 at 19:28 “Thomas Knapp November 7, 2016 at 18:20 Matt, It’s not so much that the new logo is memorable only for being incredibly ugly and uncommunicative of any information whatsoever, although that’s true. It’s also that the new logo replaced more than 40 years of insanely great branding. The Statue of Liberty was instantly recognizable and, to the extent that the LP was known by people, closely tied to it in imagery.” Funny how so much time, effort, and money has been put into the party logo over the last year or two, and this has not brought in even one new member, or gotten one Libertarian elected to office, yet there are far more important issues on which party members could focus, such as breaking open access to venues that carry public foot traffic, so that when the Libertarian Party does petition or voter registration drives, the people out gathering the signatures do not get harassed, threatened, and run off, by the police, security guards, and/or venue managers, which is one of the primary reasons that ballot access drives fail and/or run over cost, thus causing LP candidates to fail to make the ballot, and costing the party more money than it would have to spend otherwise, yet hardly anybody even tries to do anything to address this problem. Who gives a rat’s ass about what the freaking logo is? There was nothing wrong with the previous logo. How about solve some real problems and build the party, and after you have made some progress with this stuff, THEN focus on more trivial issues like the party logo? Matt November 7, 2016 at 19:36 I’m not a fan of the new logo and colors, but that’s trivial compared with website functionality. paulie November 7, 2016 at 20:51 Speaking of logo changes, I’m on the fence about giving them an article, but there’s this: http://www.nsm88.org/nsmnews/NSMAnnouncement_Nov_2016.htm Austin Cassidy November 7, 2016 at 21:59 Fixing the website is a huge issue. But the color scheme and logo of the party say something, and the old colors were far more welcoming and, as Tom notes, descriptive of the party’s liberty message. The whole site, and the marketing materials, have gone downhill in the last few years. In a few hours I’m going to go put up some signs around my local precincts. The signs have 3 or 4 different fonts, the gray and yellow colors. It’s not visually appealing and looks amateurish. It’s not the most important issue in the world, but it is important. The LP must have sent me 5 of these yellow and gray bumperstickers and I never put one on my car because they look like shit. Austin Cassidy November 7, 2016 at 22:08 There’s simple fixes that could be done to the website right now by a relative amateur. If I had access for 5 minutes. Don’t use PNG images with transparent backgrounds as featured images — the newspaper logos current on there could be reuploaded with white backgrounds as JPGs. Also, every story’s author is LBP_Manager… it’s incredibly easy to make that something less weird or the remove it from the page entirely. There’s pages with dark gray text on light gray background! WTF? When did the party fall so deeply in love with the color gray? Complimented by an ugly shade of yellow? Is someone a huge fan of Robert E. Lee or something? dL November 8, 2016 at 00:22 Screenshot capture of the new rebranding effort… https://rulingclass.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/republican-lite.png Matt November 8, 2016 at 00:48 LOL dL… right on the money. Andy November 8, 2016 at 01:43 “dL November 8, 2016 at 00:22 Screenshot capture of the new rebranding effort… https://rulingclass.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/republican-lite.png ” LOL!!!!!!! Sad but true. Stewart Flood November 8, 2016 at 13:33 As I said in a previous thread: throw it out and start over. The site sucks, from a technical standpoint to the design and even the content. It sucks. Michael H. Wilson November 8, 2016 at 14:24 The issue section of the website also needs to be improved. I have been told that few people even look at the issues section but if we are going to have one at least put some details in and add a few more important issues. If you ask for some help in writing about the issues I am sure you will get a few volunteers. I think I can say for many others that we are here and we will help. Chuck Moulton November 8, 2016 at 15:28 Here are our statewide candidates in Pennsylvania: https://www.lp.org/candidates/edward-clifford/ https://www.lp.org/candidates/james-babb/ https://www.lp.org/candidates/roy-minet/ See all that great information that helped me vote today? LP logo, check. Name, check. Office NOT LISTED. Picture NOT LISTED. Biography NOT LISTED. Issues NOT LISTED Website NOT LISTED. Facebook NOT LISTED. Twitter NOT LISTED. Contact info NOT LISTED. What a clusterfuck… I reiterate: whatever moron decided to transition to a new website 2 weeks before the election (horribly) should be immediately fired or removed from office for cause. Stewart Flood November 8, 2016 at 15:49 Chuck, Be reasonable! The majority of the LNC wanted this, so the majority of the LNC isn’t going to “immediately” fire themselves! The roll call of votes on every motion related to the website needs to be highlighted in the voting record handout at the 2018 convention. That’s the only way to remove them from office. paulie November 8, 2016 at 16:24 The majority of the LNC learned about the timing of the rollout after it happened. Ludlow says that decision was his alone. Chuck Moulton November 8, 2016 at 16:49 This annoyed me so much, I had to email the LNC again. Austin Cassidy November 8, 2016 at 17:41 “The majority of the LNC learned about the timing of the rollout after it happened. Ludlow says that decision was his alone.” In that case, Ludlow’s gotta go. And the site has gotta go. It’s slow to a crawl right now, probably feeling the peak of election day traffic. Austin Cassidy November 8, 2016 at 17:43 BTW, I put up a bunch of the LP’s yard signs for Gary Johnson last night. Drove by my polling place and sign locations today and they’re virtually invisible in the sunlight from a moving vehicle. Yellow on gray? INCREDIBLY DUMB. I should have bought more of the official blue ones from the campaign, at least they’re not f*cking invisible. Stewart Flood November 8, 2016 at 18:21 Ludlow may have made the decision, but several of us (myself included) tried to warn them when they were considering the project. There are several LNC members who bear the responsibility of pushing the others to approve this project. It should never have been done in an election year. Thomas Knapp November 8, 2016 at 18:26 Stewart, Not only should it not have been done in an election year, but Ludlow’s specific proposal for the new site’s character — which is what we’re seeing implemented — would have been a bad idea no matter when it was done. If I am not mistaken, you said so yourself at the time. So did Chuck. So did I. It’s just a shockingly bad web site in every respect. If I was a conspiracy theorist, I might be wondering whether it was the RNC or the DNC which infiltrated Ludlow into position to completely wreck the LP’s web presence at a key moment, and how much they paid him to do it. Stewart Flood November 8, 2016 at 19:23 I did say that. I said it sounded like a proposal, even if it were not an election year. Look at the LNC votes. We need to keep these at-large members off the committee in 2018. George Phillies November 8, 2016 at 19:48 Regional Representatives can be replaced now. Melinda Pillsbury-Foster November 8, 2016 at 19:54 George always gets right to the point. The LP is broken. Either fix it or replace it. Now. Chuck Moulton November 8, 2016 at 19:55 I didn’t and don’t have a problem with a new website — as lobg as the transition is done right: with minimum downtime and no loss of content or functionality. Ludlow seems to think that “millenials” value flashy graphics above all else. In my admittedly anecdotal experience dealing with “millenials” — and many other age demographics — he’s dead wrong about that. “Millenials” and others want CONTENT. Maybe they expect a pretty package too, but when you ditch the content for window dressing you put the cart before the horse and make a useless site. It’s classic O. Henry “The Gift of the Magi”… we trade all of our content for flashy graphics that are useless with no content. Caryn Ann Harlos November 8, 2016 at 19:57 I was not on the LNC at the time, and as a member vocally opposed a good deal what I am vocally opposing now as an LNC member. I was basically told to shut up by an alternate. I will not. This is Moulton’s supplement: LNC members, I want to follow up on this point. I was just looking at 404 errors before. In fact, the problem is much, much, much, much worse. The candidate listings that do exist (are not 404 errors, were properly redirected) are mostly just stubs that include only their names. These are our statewide candidates in Pennsylvania: https://www.lp.org/candidates/edward-clifford/ https://www.lp.org/candidates/james-babb/ https://www.lp.org/candidates/roy-minet/ It might be hard to tell they are our statewide candidates because their listings include only the following information: * LP logo * Name Their listings DO NOT INCLUDE any of the following information: * State * Office/district * Picture * Biography * Website link * Facebook * Twitter * Contact info If you think this problem is limited to states with less political connections, you are wrong. Here are a few listings from people running very active campaigns: https://www.lp.org/candidates/aaron-starr/ https://www.lp.org/candidates/arvin-vohra/ https://www.lp.org/candidates/lily-tang-williams/ (Disclosure note: I donated to Aaron Starr’s campaign.) Here are a few other candidates you may recognize: https://www.lp.org/candidates/norm-olsen/ https://www.lp.org/candidates/roland-riemers/ (404 error) https://www.lp.org/candidates/patrick-mcknight/ Here is one of the few candidate pages with actual information: https://www.lp.org/candidates/mark-miller/ Note that even that trails off at the end… “As an experienced PhD petroleum engineer and former UT petroleum engineering faculty member, he will undoubtedly be the most qualified candidate on the November 201”. Also the Facebook and Twitter links are broken. And it doesn’t mention what office he is seeking. Nice that the LNC donated thousands of dollars to his campaign… too bad no one bothered to spend 5 minutes fixing the errors in his candidate listing. Of course, his old page does not redirect: https://www.lp.org/candidates/liberty-candidates-16/mark-a-miller/ John Moore is a 404 page: https://www.lp.org/candidates/elected-official/john-moore/ https://www.lp.org/candidates/liberty-candidates-16/john-moore/ https://www.lp.org/candidates/john-moore/ As is Laura Ebke: https://www.lp.org/candidates/elected-official/laura-ebke/ TODAY IS ELECTION DAY. What a wasted opportunity!!! Maybe if we hadn’t shut down our working website 2 weeks before the election and replaced it with a buggy new website with 83% data loss and long load times (using a lot of precious staff time at their busiest period), we could have listed and promoted some of our candidates. Please, please, PLEASE exercise some actual oversight as a board and do something about the critical and embarrassing error torpedoing one of our greatest assets (on the eve of the election): our national lp.org website. I’ve received feedback asking me if I was being over the top or facetious suggesting someone should be FIRED or REMOVED FROM THE LNC over this. I was not. I am completely serious. What was done to the website goes beyond a harmless error. It goes beyond reckless. It was NEGLIGENT. Someone should be held accountable for all the damage that has been done to the Libertarian Party — an organization we all have poured time and money into for decades hoping to see it succeed. Thank you for your consideration. Chuck Moulton Life Member & Monthly Pledger, Libertarian Party P.S. I voted proudly for Gary Johnson and the other Libertarians on the Pennsylvania ballot today. Caryn Ann Harlos November 8, 2016 at 20:00 I have a little bitchiest here. I see all these complaints for heads. With the exception of Chuck, very little feedback is ever given to the LNC, and precious little when someone is doing something right. Has the LNC received any feedback to the attempted silencing of me by another member? Not that I have seen. Calling for heads is well and good. Supporting when some or all do what is right is even better. Stewart Flood November 8, 2016 at 20:10 I sent a lot of feedback. Unfortunately, the chair of the IT committee chose to not report my comments. Go back to the spring when we discussed this after the LNC voted to change the site. Unfortunately, I and several others correctly predicted what would happen. But now it turns out to be actually WORSE than we predicted! I’m calling for heads in 2018, which is when we have the opportunity. Ludlow is not on the LNC, so he can’t be removed. Thomas Knapp November 8, 2016 at 20:19 “Has the LNC received any feedback to the attempted silencing of me by another member? Not that I have seen.” Please elaborate. I’ve heard nothing about this. “With the exception of Chuck, very little feedback is ever given to the LNC, and precious little when someone is doing something right.” With the exception of Chuck? Fuck you. Caryn Ann Harlos November 8, 2016 at 20:22 Wow Tom I am referring to emails. I have never received one from you that is an official communication to the LNC. Chuck writes. Regularly. You sure have a short temper tonight. And elaborate? Anyone following the LNC List over the past couple weeks would know. The Chair of the IT Committee and alternate has pretty much told me I am harassing volunteers and I should be quiet. Caryn Ann Harlos November 8, 2016 at 20:23 Stewart, that is before my time. I believe you. I sent a lot of objections myself. And complained very loudly here. Thomas L. Knapp November 8, 2016 at 20:26 Caryn Ann, When I communicate officially to the LNC, it is to my regional rep, not someone else’s. Why in God’s name would I have been following the LNC list for the last couple of weeks? There’s an election going on. But anyone telling you to shut up is out of line. Caryn Ann Harlos November 8, 2016 at 20:27 There are a few people who write me personally regularly. Since those communications are personal, I am not going to say who. But if you want to get heard by the LNC, you have to write. Those emails get re-posted to the list. And I got little to know support when Alicia was debating against having members write. The involvement o the membership is very low. And that is why the membership often gets ignored. That is just reality. Very few LNC members read IPR. Even less read our FB comments. If you want to be heard, you have to write. I have an email block of the addresses copied I can share. (I think there should be a one-button “write to all” on the web page but that is another topic) Caryn Ann Harlos November 8, 2016 at 20:28 ===Caryn Ann, When I communicate officially to the LNC, it is to my regional rep, not someone else’s.== Copy everyone. You may get more support. I share important issues with my region (I communicate a GREAT DEAL with my region) and you may have allies there. I would love to see what you are asking your regional. Region 1 may wish to join in. ==Why in God’s name would I have been following the LNC list for the last couple of weeks? There’s an election going on. But anyone telling you to shut up is out of line.== Because important shit goes on. It is vitally important that we are watched like hawks by members. paulie November 8, 2016 at 20:35 The involvement o the membership is very low. And that is why the membership often gets ignored. That is just reality. From my experience both as an outside observer and a past alternate on the LNC the membership gets ignored whether we write or not. The LNC seems to generally take those copy all emails as more of an annoyance than anything else, with the exception of a few members such as Starchild, you, and me when I was on there; but I haven’t had the sense that any LNC votes were materially changed by outside input. Nevertheless I do email LNC from time to time – as you know since I copy you on some of that. I also talk to a few of them on the phone from time to time. I try not to over do it because I have a general tendency to overdo things once I get on a roll. I figure if I wanted the LNC to hear from me every day I should have run again. Caryn Ann Harlos November 8, 2016 at 20:40 Paulie, there are some members for whom it makes a difference. It certainly does to me, and I can name about five others. It matters. Even if it only matters to give moral support to those who doing what you believe is correct. Chuck Moulton November 8, 2016 at 20:43 Caryn Ann Harlos wrote: Chuck writes. Regularly. I’d rather not write so regularly. I have a lot of strong opinions coupled with knowledge and skills across a wide range of disciplines. I could chime in on practically everything. I try to hold my tongue. Historically I have emailed the entire LNC only once or twice a year — in part picking my battles so I don’t get written off as a nag and so the things I focus on have more impact. I am more prolific in IPR comments, but even then spare you all most of my opinions. I’ve only written more this year because the sheer insanity of the website debacle demands more forceful feedback. paulie November 8, 2016 at 20:46 I can name about five others Let me know which ones, either here or privately. I’d rather not write the whole committee more than every once in a while but I can communicate more regularly with those who are into it. Caryn Ann Harlos November 8, 2016 at 20:50 I don’t mind saying publicly. But I don’t want to miss anyone so I ask other LNC members to chime in. Me, Starchild, Demarest, McKnight, Hayes Others may weight member input highly but are not as vocal about it. My inclusion of the above is not meant to disparage anyone else. I welcome feedback. As much as possible. Michael H. Wilson November 8, 2016 at 20:50 Caryn back in about 2006 I started writing the LNC about problems with the issues section of the website. A few people were polite enough to reply. That did not include the then Executive Director. I wrote on this issue for a few years but little in the way of change happened. I am still concerned about the poor quality of the issues but mostly I have found better ways to use my time. I long ago quit writing to the regional reps, chairs, and officers of the LP. I will give you and Nicholas Sarwark credit for replying when I write. Jill Pyeatt November 9, 2016 at 00:09 Caryn Ann said: “With the exception of Chuck, very little feedback is ever given to the LNC, and precious little when someone is doing something right.” I have written to our new rep, Jeff Hewitt, a couple times, although he has yet to respond. He has only been our rep since April, though. Our previous rep, Dan Weiner, rarely responded, but he and I weren’t always buddies. I would always approach my rep before I wrote to the entire LNC, although there might possibly be an exception one day, I suppose. I will share with you that I was so stunned at how awful people were to Ludlow the first few days of the new site’s launching that I felt compelled to send him a personal email thanking him for what he had done so far and encouraging him to work through the problems one and one until they were resolved. In my profession, we often need to pass along bad news to people. I always explain to my new employees that there are many ways they can say something. Sometimes what is said sounds awful, but sometimes the same message can be portrayed in a much more tolerable manner. Obviously, our goal is always to be in the latter category.. I’m certainly not pleasant to everyone here, although I try to be and I often apologize if I think I’ve been out of line. Just sharing a bit of my life experience. Caryn Ann Harlos November 9, 2016 at 13:46 Jill thank you for writing that note to Kevin. Unlike most people here, I love the overall fresh modern look of the site and Kevin is working his ass off. All the positive though does not relieve me of the obligation to point out the bad: Not ready to be rolled out- awful timing. Lost data that I am not confident will return. Purposefully ideological re-branding in masthead. Not Bylaws compliant. But overall I for one love the look. dL November 9, 2016 at 14:38 “Unlike most people here, I love the overall fresh modern look of the site and Kevin is working his ass off.” The site’s look and feel, its responsiveness on modern devices is fine and professionally done…and long overdue. And I say that as a professional, a front and back end architect in the field of web/app development. Timing, Content migration, republican-lite rebranding are another matter… Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

 Snapchat invented a nifty way to charge its new smart glasses Biz Carson Nov. 6, 2016, 3:23 PM 12,260 facebook linkedin twitter email print Snapchat will soon release Spectacles, a pair of smart glasses that can record videos. Snapchat When Google released its Google Glass, it looked like a computer strapped onto some glasses, charging port and all.  The new Spectacles, made by Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., are intended to be the opposite: cool, sleek, and fashionable without a trace of the computers powering them. Pulling that off though is no easy task.  Patents published on Nov. 1 give us a small peek at what's likely under the hood of Snap's Spectacles. While the patents don't address the Spectacles by name and are simply covering "smart glasses", the drawings of the charging case are a close match to photos released by the company of the Spectacles. Snap Inc. declined to comment on this story.  To conceal the computer hidden in the glasses, Snap Inc devised a way to only expose the charging port when the arms of the glasses are folded back.  Business Insider/US Patent Office Since it's only exposed when folded, you can't tell it has a charger when you wear them out. Given most glasses are only folded when they're not in use or sitting in a case, Snap's inventions capitalize on that downtime by charging the glasses. The carrying case also doubles as a charging station. When the glasses are folded and placed in the case, the newly exposed ports connect to the case's internal charger — no extra wires required.  Business Insider/USPTO/Snap Inc   The charging case will still need to be charged on its own, but Snap Inc. told the Verge that its carrying case should last through four full charges of the Spectacles. For those lucky few who will be able to get their hands on the limited edition, charging will be more of an after-thought than a worrying barrier to use, exactly how Snap designed it.

And take note, these marketing techniques, tips, ideas and best practices can be implemented in any hotel! NB: This is a viewpoint by Patrick Landman, founder and CEO of Xotels. We will be covering the following areas of online marketing for hotels: Hotel website best practices SEO (search engine optimisation) Trademark protection SEM (search engine marketing) Metasearch marketing Discounts and loyalty offers Reputation management Booking engine requirements Conversion stimulation Great hotel website design is the first step to success First of all, you have to implement one crucial aspect into your thinking and acting: your hotel website is not only your source of pride and your ‘business card’ but also the most important tool to generate direct bookings. Your own website is your best friend and you should treat it with care and attention to detail! Your website needs to have a nice and original design, a style matching the character and DNA of your hotel, and include a user-friendly booking engine, and be well optimized to attract natural search engine results. Unfortunately many hotel websites are developed without even the basic concern for SEO and proper keyword research. This can have negative repercussions on the number of visitors and at the same time on the bookings made via the website (or in that case, the bookings which are not made!). Ergo: Step one: have an amazing website and step two: make sure travelers can find your website! So what should a great website look like and what should it feature in order to improve your rankings? The design should be impressive, clean, functional and easy to navigate. A unique user-friendly website that makes a clear brand statement, differentiating your hotel from others. Explain in great detail everything about your hotel, its services, facilities and outlets. Answer any question a potential guest might have before booking your hotel, or information that can be helpful to decide to stay with you. Tip: ask your front desk and reservation staff to list all the questions they get on a daily basis, i.e. which credit cards you accept. Use as many pictures as possible, and include a great video of your hotel and destination. We recommend at least 100 in total, and a minimum of eight images per room type. Use keyword research to determine which consumer searches you should target and develop an elaborate landing page strategy with short-, mid- and long-tail keywords. Build well optimized themed landing pages with special offers and local experiences. Include guest reviews to show what people who have already stayed with you are saying. Implement a streamlined hotel booking engine with a simplified reservation process. Mobile phone friendly: Today potential guests are typically on-the-go and more and more people book via the mobile phone. You should develop and optimize the mobile version of your hotel website and especially your booking engine. The content should focus on highlighting the most important information to facilitate the travel planning process and generate a booking. Special offers and last-minute rates should be highlighted and displayed as an eye-catcher. They should be easily bookmarked for transition to desktop. It is crucial that your website will load quickly on both the desktop and mobile devices. You can use the Google Page-Speed Insights, a mix of tools and analytics that allow you to understand how well your website is loading and at the same time to correct problems uncovered in the analytics.   Hotels should not be shy with investment in websites and online marketing. At the end getting something cheap can turn out quite expensive as you are missing on uncaptured business, needing more indirect bookings and paying more commission to OTAs. I highly recommend working with a company that has experience in the travel ecommerce industry and has made several successful hotel websites (let them demonstrate how much direct sales these websites are generating). Also make sure they use an open source CMS (content management system) such as WordPress, Joomla or Drupal so you don’t depend on them, and really own and control your website … (you would not build a hotel where the construction company owns the foundation and support pillars would you?). Note: most people know this already, but better be safe than sorry, use HTML and not Flash. Search engines cannot read Flash, hence ranking a Flash website is kind of difficult. SEO – The basis to being found on the world wide web SEO or search engine optimization can be applied by even the smallest of independent hotels to ensure a consistent, professional presence in the search engine result pages (SERPs), by applying some basic SEO elements and strategies. The most important thing to keep in mind when thinking about SEO is: change is constant! Major search engines (such as Google) are changing their algorithms more than 500 times a year while introducing new features and functionality. All the changes impact how search results appear on SERPs. You, dear hoteliers, must adopt a proactive approach to content creation and SEO. Find here some crucial SEO strategies: Content is King! When it comes to high rankings. You need truly engaging and hotel-specific content to drive conversions! Successful hotel websites not only inform, but inspire! What you want is that potential customers spend longer times on your pages and that they visit more pages of your website. So you will need uniquely engaging content, to achieve this. Also you want to minimize the bounce rate (people leaving your website from the landing page without browsing any further). Those metrics send positive signals to the search engines, which utilize the information in determining where a page ranks on the SERP. Repeating myself again to highlight the importance of mobile search which nowadays takes up a greater share of overall search activity. You need to recognize that your mobile website interface is more important than ever. Google has recognized this and penalizes search rankings for sites that have weak mobile capabilities. Make sure your content is mobile friendly! Check your property’s website on your own mobile device. How does your property look? Is it easy to make a booking? Tools are available to check different screen-sizes and devices. Additionally, of course, keep an eye on the behavior of mobile visitors (their level of engagement, where they stand within the purchase funnel) and adjust continuously. Be aware of the traffic! Check your ranking visibility on a regular basis. See how the content impacts search engines and end consumers. Get knowledge of user engagement insights and organic traffic. Be proactive in tracking via analytics tools: monitoring of keyword ranking visibility on an analytics platform (i.e. Google Analytics) using Google Webmaster Tools and Bing Search Console for technical SEO spot checks and assessments Be prepared for changes! Act quickly and effectively in response to shifts in search engine algorithms, user search demands and the competitive landscape. Regular reporting, data-gathering and action steps on ongoing optimization endeavors are the keys. Be proactive! Get help from the professionals. Don’t be shy in using technology. Reach out for leading search visibility platforms. As mentioned above, a strong content management system / CMS (ideally open-source) is crucial for real-time content and SEO updates. A (good) CMS should offer the ability to make updates (easy and in real-time) to on-page content, metadata, images, promotional tiles and other critical components. Train your staff on the usage of the CMS. Control your website and identify high-performing pages, search visibility opportunities, recent successes, top engagement and traffic sources as well as performance analysis against a comp-set. You need a uniform, streamlined and optimized local search presence. Search engines place greater trust in uniform listings across well-established portals and as a result they are more likely to prominently position your hotel on the SERP. Therefore: Reduce duplicate listings within directories, include quick verification and routine maintenance of local profiles across a variety of listing platforms (such as Google My Business, Yelp, Bing, CitySearch, Superpages, Yellow Pages, etc) Use links to build credibility! One of the most important factors in ranking in the SERPs is the way in which links interact with your website! Basically speaking, search engines learn about websites and/or specific pages by analyzing links from other sites that lead to them (that domain). Links from trustworthy and high-value sources (like .edu, .gov) signal to the search engine that the linked page/site is also trustworthy and therefore worth of a prominent placing in search results. You should monitor and regularly audit all inbound link activities and opportunities to gain credibility from links and avoid punishment for bad (spammy) links. Link management strategy is the magic phrase here! Be more than ‘just a hotel website’ There it is again – our friend ‘content’! Provide the travel planner with engaging and informative content! Avoid generic and boring descriptions. Entice the visitor. Give tips to the local area, guide about nearby attractions, tell about activities, add event calendars and interactive maps and share other interesting local knowledge. Show that you are the number one property in your location! Don’t exclude other digital marketing possibilities, such as paid search, banner advertising, email marketing, reservation retargeting etc, and turn you hotel website in a high revenue generator. Now, let’s go a bit into details on various SEO elements. Title tags is a very important element. Not only does the title appear in the clickable portion of your listing in the organic search engine results, also it improves the rankings if you place your targeted key in the title. Titles should be clear and in line with the page’s actual content. Every title tag should include those three elements to properly represent your pages and help with rankings: title of the page appropriate accompanying keywords name of your hotel / brand Note: you can only target two or three keywords per page to ensure maximum result. More will dilute your potential to rank. So you will need several landing pages to target different keyword combinations. Use Google Keyword Planner to identify the relevant keywords for your hotel and target markets. You should look beyond the obvious short-tail keywords, and also include landing pages with more fragmented mid- and long-tail keyword search combinations to penetrate the more low hanging fruit of online traffic. This will help your overall SEO strategy gain more power. Meta descriptions – They provide a short summary of the page inviting to visit your link. They are direct ranking factors and can influence other aspects like the click-through rate (how many users your page gets) and the average time the user spends on the site (both of which are direct ranking factors). Meta tag descriptions in the SERP’s can give valuable information and influence undecided users. A good meta tag will bring more traffic to your website and generate more direct bookings. Whenever a guest reaches for a keyword you include in your meta description, those terms will be in bold in the test results displayed to him. You should mention the unique selling points (USPs) – something that differentiates your hotel from your competitors and also include a call to action for a guest to book with you straight away. Make sure you send the right message to target the right audience. Note: the keywords must correspond to those in the Title Tag Headers – Create and tag headers and sub-headers in the content of your page. This is a very important on-page element for targeting keywords! Many leisure travelers use their smartphones to get travel inspiration in spare moments. The headers (caption titles) you create can capture the attention of the users and make your pages easy to navigate. Using these kind of caption titles makes it simple to understand what your page is about. Recognizing the topic will improve your usability statistics, which in turn will improve the SEO score of your landing pages. Use a clear structure with paragraphs broken down into subdivisions. It will make your website user-friendly. Content – I repeat: Google search algorithms are very sophisticated, which means you need amazing content! The most important factors for your content are: quality (engaging stories), readability (free of spelling and grammar errors, easy to navigate and scannable (short paragraphs and bullet points), freshness (updated information, correct pricing), usability (functional links, easy to navigate with a quick possibility to find what the user is looking for, easy to book directly). Ergo: Pay attention to detail! Make sure your headers are tagged appropriately, your website is easy to scan and read and publish fresh quality content to engage readers. And don’t forget: Content is king when it comes to good rankings! Rich Snippets –  They provide an instant information about your hotel through reviews and ratings (a star rating displayed below your Title Tag, a review written by a customer which replaces the meta description, specific business information such as address or opening hours). Rich Snippets can instantly boost the click ratings. A very useful SEO tactic in your arsenal. To display a rating/review Rich Snippet you will need a developer to ‘mark up’ the corresponding text on your website using the standards found on Schema.org. You could also use any other type of Rich Snippets such as Events and Product/Price Markup. The information about an upcoming event can be displayed just below the Title Tag and Meta Description. Hotels can take advantage of concerts, happenings, special theme nights, festivals etc. by listing them as a Rich Snippet. TripAdvisor relies mainly on the use of Product/Price Markup Snippets. As they occupy the same space as rating/review Snippets, you have to make a choice as to what you would prefer to display in your site’s Rich Snippet. Rich Snippets don’t affect directly your search rankings but they have an influence on the rate of users clicking on your listings in the search results, as well as on the bounce rate and the average session duration. These snippets not only draw the eyes of users to your listings but also give them instant information and an additional reason to click through your website. As I mentioned above: linking is a very popular and effective SEO tactic! There are two types of links – internal and external links. Internal links point to other pages on your website. They help search engine spiders to find all the pages on your website (in order to rank high on SERPs, the search engines must first know that the pages exist) and they make it easier for the potential guest to find what they need (i.e. a link to the reservation menu for a direct booking). External links are either inbound (lead users to your page from other pages) or outbound (lead users from your page to other pages). Google also looks for websites to link out to other relevant websites, that shows that a website participates in the community (and is not interpreted as spammy). Reaching out to other websites for linking them to yours is an important and simple tactic to generate traffic. Think of travel bloggers and hotel listing websites. Protect What is Yours The most basic and simple step is to claim what is rightfully yours. And that is your name, your trademark is yours. Protect it! Many hotels don’t, and therefor basically allow OTAs to bid on their trademark in search engines, and steal their direct business. That is just damn stupid in my book. Why would you let the OTA take the traffic of people who are specifically looking for your hotel. You can easily control your distribution cost and direct production by implementing brand protection as part of your online marketing strategy. Meaning that you should submit the hotel’s trademark to Google (and other search engines) to block ads with the hotel name/brand by others. Why? Be aware that when working with OTAs, those third-party websites also advertise on your hotel brand name (on brand keywords) on Google, Yahoo and Bing. How? When a consumer is doing a search for a particular hotel (yours in this case) on Google the OTAs are bidding via Google Adwords on your hotel name and are diverting potential direct bookers to their third-party travel agency website. This ad appears on the top of the listings in Google and the unaware customer clicks on it first and lands on his page (not on yours).   Through advertising on the hotel name in the search engines, the OTA’s intent is to convert this direct client into their own client – for your hotel or even worse re-direct them to yet another hotel! This phenomenon is lately very questioned and referred to as ‘SEM hijacking’ or ‘brand keyword robbery’. The OTAs should focus on generating extra bookings and incremental revenue, but unfortunately they don’t show much consideration to that promise, especially when it comes to independent hotels. Yep, this is what we think of hotel brand hijacking by OTA’s So what is the solution? How do you protect your hotel brand? You need to have your brand officially registered. You can register your brand locally or on a European level. The European level registration is of course much more effective. An online application costs €850 for a trademark. Once you have your trademark registered you have to submit it to Google, using this link as a starting point. Once this is accepted you’ll have to do a follow up with Google (by email) to make sure all advertisers adhere to the policy. Remember, you will not be able to remove all advertising on your hotel brand name, just those showing your hotel brand name in the ad text (the URL is excluded). That’s right – it should be your own website on top, always! The aim should be to create a true win-win situation, and not one as the OTAs smartly try to define it in their sales pitch to hoteliers. Sure, you need their help to reach a larger audience of potential guests but also they need you (probably even more) because at the end it’s you who have the rooms. With that comes the power of negotiation. Enough for today. UPDATE: Click to read PART TWO of our hotel internet marketing plan for independent hotels.

Absolutely agree on the point we should invest funds into mobile version of a website. I’m almost sure that sooner or lated the majority will stick to their smartphones and we need to focus on optimizing pages and services for such customers.

Carnegie Mellon's Student Newspaper Since 1906 October 31, 2016 Current Issue Home News Sci/Tech Forum Sports Pillbox Comics Advertising Archives October 31, 2016 Join the Staff | Advertising | About Us | Contact Us Memes outrun Jesus in Google search hits Zeke Rosenberg Oct 30, 2016 Tweet EMAIL PRINT Suggest this article to a friend: From: (name) (email) To: (email) Editorials featured in the Forum section are solely the opinions of their individual authors. As the Apostles put the finishing touches on the writings they had been circulating in the first century, their breakout character Jesus Christ began to slowly rise to prominence. It was at that moment that the western world’s most popular meme was born. By the fourth century, the Roman Emperor Constantine became a Christian and the religion started to become a dominant force in European culture. To this day, Christianity remains the world’s most widely practiced religion. Dictionary.com defines a meme as a cultural item that is transmitted by repetition. The memes that spread on the internet today are usually funny images that catch on with an online community, but the idea is the same as the memes that existed before the internet. Though it seems ridiculous given the tradition behind Jesus and the fleeting popularity of internet memes, Jesus is transmitted by repetition and therefore is a meme himself. For the first time, however, despite the kitschy reputation of memes and the centrality of Jesus to the lives of many people, we now have evidence that Jesus is not more popular than all other memes combined. Since we live in the future, we have Google to tell us that, during the week between Aug. 21 and 27, memes surpassed Jesus in Google searches and has held its advantage long enough so it no longer looks like a fluke. Google is far from a perfect measure of global popularity. Many countries in Eastern Europe, Central and East Asia, and Africa are not included in the data at all, biasing it towards the predominantly white, western societies that also have more frequent access to the internet. Further, what we now call memes are an internet-based phenomenon, while Jesus is not. Google searches for memes outpace Jesus globally, but when the data is broken down by country memes win in only six countries worldwide (Mexico, Chile, Ireland, Finland, Greece, and Australia). Even when considering all of this, the shift signals an important change in how our culture grows and develops. Prior to the internet, our culture could only come from the people around us and the limited information we had access to. Now that platforms such as Twitter and Tumblr exist to launch the things that amuse us into the cultural stratosphere for a week, our cultural consciousness can incorporate the feelings and reactions of a much wider audience beyond our personal bubbles. There are consequences to deviating from the norm when our communities are so local. People risk being ostracized from friends and family for everything from rejecting religion to rejecting local food and becoming a vegan. The internet allows a massive, global testing ground for the growth and acceptance of our culture and normalizes things outside of a person’s immediate setting. This allows our culture to grow and diversify in ways that would have previously been bizarre. Rather than millennia old beliefs dominating our views our views and dialogue, sometimes we can now draw a frog on a unicycle and laugh about it for a few days before moving on to the next thing. Memes surpassing Jesus in Google searches is more of a goofy news story than an actual harbinger of massive cultural change. Brutal cultural divides still exist and still can be painful for a lot of people. That said, between the endless millennial bashing of journalism’s elder guard and a year that has been a political nightmare for so many across the world, it’s nice to have a reminder every now and then that our world is growing now as much as ever. We’re not nearly as tethered to the previous ideas and lifestyles of social circles we find ourselves in and that’s a good thing.

Few people might say it’s an interesting war but the progress in the field is not enough to put a ding in the Universe. AI is an interesting field and I always jump right up when I hear something about AI from tech giants but when I try them out I tell myself “AI is the future. Not the present.” Samsung recently bought Viv-labs, an artificial intelligence company started by the creators of Siri. Samsung’s plan is to use Viv’s strong AI software in their upcoming phones (till now its been just said that S8 will be running it) rather than modifying it and implementing it. Most Samsung phones run Android which comes with Google Now built-in, it will interesting to see how Samsung’s own assistant will be integrated – will run alongside Google Now or the company will get rid of Google Now and run only its own assistant. Samsung also makes phones that run it own homegrown operating system – Tizen OS. In the past there have been rumours of Samsung dumping Google’s Android and shifting completely to Tizen but that seems like a stretch and something that’s not going to happen anytime soon. With Samsung making its own AI assistant, it looks like the company is indeed trying to take control of things rather than depending completely on Google. This move by Samsung looks like it’s preparing its base. Tizen might have a bright future or it might never see the light but these steps are part of being very “Samsung” centric. Viv’s software is pretty interesting – it has the strength of working seamlessly with third party services. Samsung’s Executive Vice President, Rhee In-jong says that developers can can attach and upload services to make the AI assistant more intelligent. The AI assistant, if actually helpful, can make the S8 stand apart and also help the company recover from Note 7’s debacle. It will be interesting to see how Samsung’s AI assistant will compete against Google’s AI based on its strong knowledge graph.

 Why Google really spent $625 million on a company generating $92 million in revenue Julie Bort Nov. 6, 2016, 12:00 PM 41,584 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google cloud boss Diane Greene Google Google's $625 million acquisition of Apigee announced in September hasn't closed yet, but should be done after Apigee's November 8 stockholder meeting, someone familiar with the matter told Business Insider. That will be a relief to Apigee employees, whose morale was pretty low when the company went public in 2015.  And it will set in motion a plan by Google's new cloud boss Diane Greene to bolster its business and step up the fight with cloud superpower Amazon. Although Google's largest acquisition of the year was widely viewed a means for the company to get its hands on specialized app developer technology, Greene appears to have seen something else in Apigee, a bruised enterprise cloud company with a turbulent past.  Hanging by a thread Apigee's troubles go back to its 2015 IPO. Usually employees are thrilled when their startup graduates to the public markets because it means that they will soon be able to sell the shares they earned (often in lieu of higher pay). But in this case, just before the IPO, Apigee told its employees that it was doing a massive 1-for-7.6 reverse stock split. Every 7.6 shares became a single share. That dashed many employees hopes of making a ton of money on the IPO. "It was very demoralizing, the day before the IPO, they reverse split the stock by 8x. That was a jerk move to be very honest, but at the same time, the company wouldn’t have IPO'd if they didn’t do that," this person said. None of the investors sold shares in the IPO either. They were under similar lock-up constraints as employees. That's not uncommon, especially with a soft and sketchy IPO market. IPO bankers don't want to flood the market with more shares when investors are lukewarm. And then Apigee's IPO was not a stunning success. It was labeled an "IPO down-round," a company that went public at a lower valuation than its private investors had given it. It priced at $17 a share, valuing the company at $494.5 million. It's VCs had valued it at $600 million when it last raised cash in the summer of 2014. On the first day of trading, the shares ended the day below its IPO price. And things tanked from there. By the summer of 2016, the stock was below $6.50 a share. When the lockup expired in October, 2015, shares were in the $10 range. "Apigee has always been hanging on by a thread," this person told us. "Everybody was locked up and the market was very volatile. Existing VCs who had been in there for a long time, didn't really get a chance to really let their shares go. So Apigee had been looking for a buyer, basically since the day of the IPO." And that means that when the shares crashed even further last winter, under $6 a share, prospective buyers like Microsoft or Amazon could have swept up Apigee for a practical pittance, a fraction of its IPO valuation. But they didn't. Enter a frustrated Google Meanwhile, Google hired Diane Greene late last year to help it become cloud computing giant. Although Google had poached Amit Singh from Oracle a few years earlier, and he had been successfully nabbing big companies for Google Apps (renamed Google for Work under Singh and recently renamed G-Suite under Greene), Google really wasn't set up to be an enterprise cloud company. Apigee CEO Chet Kapoor Apigee Greene, co-founder and previous CEO of VMware and a current Google board member, set about hiring and reorganizing at Google. She built a cloud sales and support team and added more enterprise friendly features to Google's cloud. While Greene says she is pleased with the progress, it's an open secret within the tech industry that Google is having a hard time landing big contracts with big customers the way Amazon and Microsoft are doing. Some say that Google isn't even being invited to bid on those contracts. On top of that, there are signs that Google's biggest marquee customer to date, Snap (parent of Snapchat) may soon be leaving Google to build its own data center, as it readies for an IPO. Snap has been hiring data center experts. And Snapchat is no longer featured prominently on Google's cloud customer pages.  And that's where Apigee can fits in. Stepping stone Google agreed to pay $625 million cash, $17.40 a share, a 6.5% premium over Apigee's previous closing price. This was Google's largest disclosed acquisition in 2016. That was not an excessively high price. In October, Apigee announced annual revenue of $92 million and a net loss of $41.5 million, with revenue growing by over 30% and losses narrowing over the previous year. That's a bit over 6x revenue, not untypical. Still, it was a lot more than it would have paid just a few months earlier. It basically paid Apigee's final valuation before it went public, giving investors a face-saving, profitable exit. Apigee offers a service for creating and hosting application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs allow computer program to work together, for instance, when a mobile app adds an appointment to your calendar, it's using the calender's API. While Google can use Apigee's tech, the technology wasn't the real focus, the person with knowledge of the matter told us.   Of all the features Google needs to add to its cloud to catch up to Amazon and Microsoft, API hosting isn't top of the heap, this person says, although Amazon does offer its own. (But Amazon is miles ahead of every other cloud in terms of all the features it offers.) Flickr/Will Merydith "Why is this the first thing Diane bought? And why would Google pay the most money for Apigee when no one else would pay that much? Because Google is dead last in cloud, and behind on every metric. It's not like Google needed an API platform," this person said. "But they did need revenue. They did need executive talent, they did need logos." Apigee has an experienced enterprise salesforce who have landed a long list of enterprise customers such as Allstate, AT&T, Burberry, First Data, Kaiser Permanente, Walgreens etc. All told, Apigee has more than 335 customers, it says. More importantly, Apigee is a big AWS customer. Apigee's cloud service is built on Amazon's Web Service and a number of its customers also host their API apps on AWS as well. Once Google moves Apigee to Google's cloud, it has a compelling inside sales track to convince 335 more enterprise customers to do the same. And once these customers try Google's cloud for their API's, Google intends to be invited to bid for their other cloud needs. If it works as planned, Google just might take its pocketbook out and buys some more cloud companies next year. As Google's CEO Pichai Sundar said on CNBC last week: "And as we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and headcount growth." Apigee declined comment and Google did not respond to request for comment.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Beyond Stocks Macro View Net Worth Real Assets Your Money Firm Calls Mutual Funds Technically People Globe-trotting, with equities Anand Kalyanaraman   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet It’s a good idea to seek out stock market opportunities abroad even when the Indian market is buzzing. We explain why and how Had you bought shares of the ubiquitous Google (now Alphabet) five years back, your money would have more than doubled by now. An investment in the Facebook stock would have more than tripled in this period. That’s a neat annualised return of 20-30 per cent. But these shares are not listed in India and you have to look beyond the borders to invest in them. Thankfully, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allows this. Under its Liberalised Remittance Scheme, resident individuals may remit up to $2,50,000 in each financial year for permitted capital and current account transactions. These include investing in equities abroad. But why must one seek overseas opportunities when there is so much promise in Indian equities? There are some good reasons. Diversification and niche plays The first is diversification — a core principle of portfolio management that helps reduce overall risk. Not all global markets do as well or as badly at the same time. In calendar year 2015, for instance, while the Sensex fell 5 per cent, the technology heavy Nasdaq index in the US gained 6 per cent. In 2014 though, the Sensex had raced much faster than most global indices (see table, “Not in lockstep”). While the Indian economy is no doubt better positioned than many others, there is no certainty that this will always continue. So, having your eggs in a few baskets can help shield your portfolio from volatility in a single market and improve overall return. Next, there are unique listed opportunities abroad that are not available in India. For instance, companies at the cutting edge of technology such as Alphabet (Google), Facebook, Apple and Amazon. If you want a piece of this pie, there is little choice but to look abroad. Also, the stocks of many foreign companies — with good growth prospects — trade much cheaper than Indian ones. From food majors such as Kellogg Company (trailing price-to-earnings of 20 times) to industrial manufacturers such as 3M (21 times), several stocks abroad quote at tidy discounts to Indian peers and subsidiaries (Britannia Industries - 49 times, 3M India - 71 times). Besides, having foreign currency-denominated investments may be a good idea if you foresee their use in the future — say, to fund your child’s higher education abroad or to buy a house in a foreign country. Risks and restrictions Investing abroad, however, entails higher risks and may not be for everyone. For one, the information asymmetry could be high. Investing in equities can be complicated and comes with the risk of capital loss. This is more so in the case of international equity where you may not have access to the latest information and research about the foreign economy, industry and company. Keeping abreast of the happenings that impact your foreign investment is essential to mitigate this risk. Next, you have to deal with currency risk while investing in international equities. That’s because your rupees get converted into a foreign currency while investing and vice versa while redeeming. If the rupee appreciates during this period, you lose and if it depreciates, you gain. For instance, over the past five years, with the rupee weakening about 35 per cent against the dollar, investments in US stocks would have gained additionally to this extent. But adverse currency movements, which can never be ruled out, could dent price gains on the foreign stock. Currency risk can be managed by hedging with the use of instruments such as futures, forwards and options. This needs some know-how, though, and may not be easy for the common retail investor. Also, it does not make sense to hedge the currency risk if the investment in foreign currency is earmarked for some future purpose such as your child’s higher education. Make sure to be on the right side of the law, both Indian and foreign. While the RBI allows Indian residents to invest in financial securities including equities abroad, there is a bar on leveraged offerings such as margin products. Stay away from these. Through brokers is one route There are two broad ways you can invest in foreign stocks — the do-it-yourself mode through a broker or via the mutual fund route. A few Indian brokers such as ICICI Direct, SMC Global Securities and Religare Securities have tie-ups with brokers abroad to facilitate overseas investment for their customers. ICICI Direct and SMC Global Securities have tied up with Denmark-based Saxo Bank while Religare Securities has an arrangement with Bahrain-based Mubasher Financial Services. You can also open an account directly with foreign brokers such as Interactive Brokers and Saxo Capital Markets. To open the overseas account, you must submit the account opening form to the broker along with KYC documents including identity proof and residential proof. Account opening charges could range from ₹1,000 to ₹1,500 at local brokerages. Then, you have to transfer funds from a local bank to the overseas account after submission of a few documents, including Form A2, an application cum declaration form, and a FEMA declaration form. A minimum initial deposit equivalent of $5,000 or more may be required, though there may be no need to maintain this on a monthly basis. You can then buy and sell stocks on the online platform of the overseas broker. Investments are allowed across multiple geographies and markets. While the account can be opened in one foreign currency, say, the US dollar, you can invest in other markets too, subject to currency conversion charges. Brokerage rates vary with the country and exchanges. For instance, transactions in the US market usually entail a flat per trade brokerage while those in European and Asian markets are charged as a percentage of the transaction value. Also, there are generally minimum charges for transactions. For instance, ICICI Direct-Saxo Bank’s commission rate for transactions on the US exchanges is 2 cents per share with a minimum commission of $15 each order. For London Stock Exchange transactions, the commission is 0.14 per cent of the order value, subject to a minimum £8 an order. There are other charges too, such as custody fees for the securities. Going with an international broker directly rather than routing through a local broker may work out more cost-effective since it would mean one less layer of intermediation. Says Ankit Shah, Director of Sales at Interactive Brokers (India) Pvt Ltd, “Other local brokers in India that provide access to global markets have tied up with foreign brokers, so yes, there would most likely be an additional layer of cost involved.” Interactive Brokers charges half a US cent per share with a minimum of $1 per order and minimum brokerage fees of $10 a month. Saxo Capital Markets charges 1 cent per share with a minimum fee of $9.9 per order. Active traders with a certain minimum number of trades get competitive brokerage rates. Check rates and other charges offered by various players; it is possible for some local brokers to have global relationships with international brokers which could translate into lower cost due to high volumes. When you are investing through a broker, you are essentially taking your own calls on the stock and taking on currency and other risks. So, do your homework well. Rudra Dalmia, formerly CEO of Saxo Bank India, says, “It is important to have knowledge about the specific security being purchased and the currency being invested in. Half-baked knowledge is dangerous and can lead to losses. Read international investment websites, research well and then start trading.” While selecting a broker for international trade, check out the entity’s credibility, financial position and strength, the products and markets being offered, the cost of transacting and transparency, and the sophistication of the trading technology being used. Through mutual funds If all this sounds cumbersome, you can consider the mutual fund route to get exposure to foreign stocks. There are three ways to go about this. Through your international broking account, you can buy units of exchange traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds listed abroad. Next, you can go for India-based feeder funds (for example, Franklin India Feeder Franklin US Opportunities Fund) that invest in funds abroad, or in India-based funds that invest largely in international stocks (for example, ICICI Pru US Bluechip Equity Fund). You can also put money in local funds that invest a part of their corpus in foreign stocks — this category includes funds such as Parag Parikh Long Term Value Fund and Templeton India Equity Income Fund. The performance of these various funds has been mixed over the past few years (see table “Global Funds - a mixed bag”). That said, investing in foreign stocks through a local mutual fund saves you the trouble of opening an overseas broking account, doing the research before investing, taking on various risks and minimum brokerage commitments. Investing through an India-based mutual fund can also be more cost-effective and tax-efficient. Funds that invest at least 65 per cent of the corpus in Indian stocks are categorised as equity funds; investors in such funds do not have to pay tax on capital gains if the units are sold after holding for at least one year. Gains on direct investments in foreign equity or in foreign listed mutual funds will be subject to capital gains. Also, dividends in such cases will be taxed in the investor’s hands both abroad and in India, unlike dividends declared by India-based funds which are exempt from tax in the investor’s hands. Also, mutual funds, being institutional clients with large volumes, will likely get favourable rates on brokerage, currency conversion and other charges on their global stock dealings. On the flipside, like in any other mutual fund, you incur expenses including fund management charges that eat into returns. Also, you do not have the flexibility of selecting stocks, but have to go with the fund manager’s choice. If you have a large corpus, seek flexibility in choices and asset classes, and have the wherewithal to research your investments, opening an account directly with a foreign broker will be worthwhile. Else, the India-based mutual fund route to investing in foreign stocks seems the better option.

The company first started taking orders for this product via its online store but it’s available for purchase from other places as well now. Google Home is powered by Google’s AI Assistant so it’s capable of doing much more than you actually need it for. It also works with other smart devices but you obviously need to have those gadgets in order to truly get the most out of this product. If you don’t want to purchase it from the Google Store, you can pick up the Google Home from Best Buy, Walmart, and Target. It may not be available from Amazon considering the fact that the company already has a Google Home rival on the market in the shape of Amazon Echo. Google Home can get so much done for you, and then some. It can respond to your voice commands and play music, manage everyday tasks, and also control other smart devices in your home. It also has a multi-room feature which you can use to blast music throughout your entire house.

We’ve had the current UI for about a year, but now it looks like Google is testing another minor update for the app, and it’s already appearing on some user’s devices. The new UI was previously briefly shown in one of Google’s Pixel tips videos, but now we’re seeing it start to roll out. The changes here are small, but they are significant enough to give the app a new feel. What’s new? As for features we’ve can’t see much just yet. It seems like this is mostly an update with cosmetic changes. The first big set of changes can be found on an app page. A new larger “install” button shows when installing a new app takes up nearly the width of the screen. The app’s rating and number of installs are also available on the main screen instead of having to scroll around for that information. It’s also easier to read than it previously was. On the main screen — “home” screen if you will — the green icons and “header bar” have adopted a darker shade of green which, personally, I prefer. The app carousel also gets a big redesign, moving from the top of the screen to just below the search bar with a new card-like design. This also looks much better to my eyes. We don’t know when this UI will roll out to everyone, but as both Android Police readers and TheAndroidSoul are seeing it hit devices, it would seem like Google is aiming to bring this sooner rather than later. Also worth noting, this is very likely a server-side change, not via an update to the app itself. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsWhere Exactly are Microsoft Deserters Going? (MSFT) Where Exactly are Microsoft Deserters Going? (MSFT) While Google stays comfortably on top of the browser race, a renewed battle for second place heats up as Mozilla tries to sneak past Microsoft. November 6, 2016 WSP According to analytics vendor Net Applications, the number of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) browser users dropped by another 40 million last month, bringing the total to over 330 million for the year. The biggest decline in the number of Microsoft browser users was in May of this year when the combined users of Internet Explorer and Edge dropped by 2.7%. And for the first time ever, based on StatCounter figures, Mozilla Firefox overtook Microsoft browser users by 0.1% — that’s a user base of 15.6% vs. 15.5%. October’s decline is the second highest for Microsoft as user base dropped by 2.3%. With an average decline of around 2% a month, it will not be surprising if the 20.2% drop in user base since the start of the year will go up to about 25% by year end. With 2 months left, there’s a chance the number could go even higher. Where exactly are Microsoft’s deserters going? In the past, it was almost always Google that benefitted from Microsoft’s loss as majority of those who leave IE and Edge shift to Google Chrome. It’s different this time. As of the end of October, Net Applications says that browser users are divided into the following: 55% use Google Chrome; 28.4% use Internet Explorer and Edge (2.3% down from September’s figures); 11.1% use Mozilla Firefox (2% up from September count); and 5.5% use other browsers like Opera and Safari. In actual numbers, that’s around 640 million for Google, 466 million for Microsoft, and 180 million for Mozilla. Puzzling as it is, the numbers show that as Microsoft’s user share declined, Mozilla’s Firefox user base has gone up by almost the same number. In fact, during the last 2 months, the number of Firefox users has increased to the point that it has already compensated for the losses Mozilla incurred last year. Internet browsing has been accepted as an indispensable part of our daily lives. And clearly, Google Chrome remains as the most popular browser because it is easy to use, opens quickly, and comes with many features and add-ons that makes browsing enjoyable and safe. In terms of power efficiency, Microsoft is claiming that Edge can be used longer than any other browser on a Windows 10 device. Several tests have already proven this claim and one video test even showed that Microsoft Edge lasted 3 hours longer than Google Chrome. But what about Firefox? In a recent article by IT Pro, Firefox seemed to be the best browser due to its all-around solid performance. Could this verdict be true that the public is now slowly catching on? With their stats continuing to plummet, Microsoft better do something fast to put an end to this alarming trend. Otherwise, Firefox might just succeed in overtaking them for good.

(MSFT) John November 6, 2016 at 9:12 am Before switching to Google, I had many problems with IE. The “Web page is not responding” error being the big one. The incompatibility with Norton might be one of the reasons people might be skipping over edge. Just a thought. Reply Smee November 6, 2016 at 6:37 pm I am forced to use Windows at work, and the only browser we are allowed is the execrable Internet Explorer. We were using Chrome for a while, until our IT mavens decided that there were too many “security flaws” for us to continue. They disabled its use, and restricted us to IE. Yet IE crashes with as little as ONE open screen. Given a choice, I would use ANYTHING instead of Internet Explorer. Reply Steve November 7, 2016 at 12:06 pm I suggest listening to the younger generation. They know what is better when it comes to browser choices. I was an IE user for over a decade. Then I started experiencing errors, crashing and unable to open certain pages. Switched to Chrome. Never looked back. Change brings improved tech. Go with it. Reply Gary November 9, 2016 at 6:29 pm The anti-MS fan boys/girls are in full force as it remains a hobby of the living-in-their-moms-basement crowd. Chrome/Firefox and the other plethora of browsers all have their own security flaws and efficiency issues. When you own your own company that must interact with the internet, you too will appreciate using software from reputable suppliers whose income depends on a good product… Sadly this leaves out many open source alternatives. Apache is free but has significant issues, Libre Office is incompatible with the majority of the world, Linux has so many varieties, there’s just simply no standardization… etc, etc, etc My Linux machines update nearly everyday with bug fixes and we additionally hear about virus writers taking ever increasing notice of Linux machines and observe they’re re-tooling their products to effect mayhem in the Linux community. Security through obscurity is no longer viable protection. If you utilize computers in your personal/professional life, then just learn there will likely always be problems of one type or another… just as in the cars we drive, the cell phones we adore, just as in life.

Google snaps up the creators of a game-focused Android emulator Engadget 11/6/2016 Jon Fingas © Provided by Engadget You can already run Android apps on a Chromebook, but would you run games and other intensive mobile apps on it? Probably not. However,Google might be taking steps to make that practical. The creators of LeapDroid, an Android emulator that specializes in games, have revealed that they're joining Google just months after releasing it to the public. The team isn't discussing "specific plans," but they're halting both development and support for LeapDroid. You can continue running the latest version, but you won't get anything more than that. It's not clear just how the deal went down, although the team suggests that this isn't a straight-up acquisition: LeapDroid is "not affiliated" with Google despite the move. We've asked Google for more details and will let you know if it can shed light on what's happening.

On a basic level, it could help with Android's performance in non-native environments -- something as fast as LeapDroid could help developers testing Android apps, or give Chrome OS devices an extra boost running mobile titles. In the long term, though, it could be important for that oft-rumored Android/Chrome union. If you're going to merge two largely disparate platforms, you want to eliminate as many potential hiccups as possible. While there's no certainty that you'll see conspicuous uses of LeapDroid's tech, it won't be surprising if the extra talent makes Google's vision of computing that much more realistic.

Over the last week, global searches related to the election have surged — particularly in Canada, Uganda, Ghana, Ireland and Nigeria, the countries outside the US where Google search interest has been the highest over the past 7 days. According to this week’s trends, here’s what the rest of the world wants to know before America heads to the polls. EUROPE The Irish want to know where to place their bets. Searches related to election odds and a popular online betting site rose in popularity throughout the week. The search “Trump win” increased by 5000%, which might suggest gambler’s regret — one betting website has already paid out $1.1 million on a Clinton victory. ASIA In Singapore, it’s all about Clinton and the dollar. Singaporeans searching for information about Clinton’s FBI probe are also querying the Dow Jones and the price of Groupon shares. When news broke that the FBI was looking into new Clinton emails, the Dow dropped 125 points, but then rebounded later in the day once more information was released. AFRICA In Ghana, people want to know when the election is; Ugandans are looking for recent polling statistics. Nigerians searching for “the latest on Hillary Clinton” are also checking out CNN polls; Kenyans, meanwhile, prefer Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight. AUSTRALASIA Australians don’t want to miss the results — and since they are many time zones away, they want to be sure they get their dates right. Related searches show that Aussies who are into US politics are also interested in what’s going on in Lebanon. Last week, Lebanon elected the former army general Michel Aoun into power, ending the political vacuum which left the country without a head of state for 2 years. In New Zealand, searches for James Comey, Clinton and the FBI spiked this week. And like the Irish, New Zealanders are also placing their bets on who they think might win. NORTH AMERICA Canadians are mostly interested in Clinton — searches for James Comey, FBI Clinton and the Clinton emails have been trending since the latest in the email saga broke earlier this week.

News Photos Ticket Sports Obits E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive A smart-speaker face-off Sunday Nov 6, 2016 at 2:01 AM By Brian X. ChenThe New York Times To get an idea of how annoying it can be to say “OK, Google” multiple times a day, try replacing the word Google with another brand. OK, Pepsi. OK, Chipotle. OK, Skittles. You get the picture. It’s difficult to utter “OK, Google,” the phrase used to control Google’s new Home smart speaker, without sounding like a marketing tool. That is too bad because Google’s Home is otherwise a preternaturally smarter speaker than its closest rival, Amazon’s Echo. Google is released Home Friday in the hope of riding the coattails of Echo, the Amazon gadget that is powered by the virtual assistant called Alexa. Echo became available last year to much fanfare. By posing questions and making requests to Alexa, people have since put Echo to work as a shopping assistant, kitchen companion and home automation tool. Amazon has a bona fide hardware hit. So Google created a similar smart speaker powered by the omniscient brains of Google search. To see how Home compares with Echo, I grilled both side by side for six days. I tested the speakers in categories they share in common: music, trivia, dining, entertainment and the smart home. What I found was that while Echo is currently more capable than Home, partly because a larger number of third-party companies have worked with Amazon to add capabilities to its speaker, Google’s product is poised to surpass Echo in the coming years. Home’s link to Google’s database of information means it will most likely be able to give superior answers in the future. In addition, music played from Home sounds clearer and its virtual assistant is a better listener than Alexa. So for those deciding between the two products, I recommend waiting to see if Home expands its abilities before making a purchase.Pop quiz All virtual assistants, which are backed by artificial intelligence, are still fairly dumb, including Google’s Assistant, Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana. But Google’s Assistant is smarter than Alexa. A competent virtual assistant should be able to answer all sorts of arbitrary questions. Is Pluto a planet? Was Bill Murray in any TV shows? How do I build a bee trap? Amazon’s Alexa was not able to answer those questions. But Google’s Home yanked an answer from its vast database of online search results. Pluto is a dwarf planet. Bill Murray was in “Saturday Night Live.” And to make a bee catcher, you cut the top off a bottle, flip over the top and staple it onto the bottom part of the bottle. There are times when Google gets stumped while Alexa succeeds. Asked who was ahead in the presidential polls, Google’s Assistant had no answer. But Alexa said Hillary Clinton was polling at 45.1 percent and Donald J. Trump at 43.1 percent. Why would Assistant not produce a response when the answers are out there from a quick Google search? Rishi Chandra, a vice president for product management at Google, said that when Google could confidently answer a question, Home would respond appropriately. But when it is less certain, it won’t offer a guess. “We’re being really cautious with this feature.”Smart home Google’s speaker is called Home because of a vision that the gadget will work with many devices in someone’s residence, be it a coffee maker or a garage door opener. Yet on day one, the speaker will work with products from only three smart home companies. Those include Nest, the thermostat maker owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet; SmartThings, Samsung’s smart home accessories maker; and Philips, which offers smart lighting systems called Hue. Missing from Home is support for smart home products from companies like Honeywell, TP-Link and LIFX, all of which are supported by Echo. With Home, I managed to get Google’s Assistant to control my Hue smart lights. The setup was relatively easy but ran into some problems: The Home app detected four lights when I actually had two. I wasn’t able to hook up my Honeywell smart thermostat or my TP-Link smart plug for controlling my coffee maker with Home because of Google’s lack of support for the devices. Google said it focused on getting Nest, SmartThings and Hue because they were the largest smart home companies on the market. More partnerships are to come.Music and podcasts One major purpose of smart speakers is to play music and radio programs. Both speakers were good at serving tunes and radio programs from popular services and stations, but Home was superior. For playing music from my Spotify account, both Home and Echo were adept at playing songs from popular artists like Sia, Radiohead and Bon Iver. Home was generally better at understanding requests to play specific Spotify playlists or soundtracks. For example, asking the speakers to play the soundtrack for the film “Drive” resulted in Home playing the correct soundtrack, but Alexa played the album “2014 Forest Hills Drive” by J. Cole. For podcasts, both speakers were adequate — but again, Home was better. Alexa could play better-known podcasts like “Fresh Air” or “Radio Lab,” but it failed to play “The Sporkful,” a less popular podcast. Google could play just about any podcast I asked for. Google also came out ahead in this category because of sound quality. Both speakers sound good, but Home sounds louder and clearer, with deeper bass. In my tests, Home also did a better job taking requests while the speaker played loud music, whereas Alexa often seemed deaf.Dining and entertainment Alexa and Home are both fairly lacking when it comes to requests related to food and entertainment. The Google speaker does not have the capability to place orders for delivery food. Alexa can order a pizza from Domino’s but, otherwise, can’t do much else for delivery orders. Neither speaker can book a table for a restaurant nearby. Still, both assistants excelled in detailing places to eat in the area. Asking them to find Chinese food nearby prompted them to list some local Chinese restaurants. Google did better here by also listing the street where the restaurants were. One task Alexa can pull off that Google can’t is listing showtimes for movies playing in the neighborhood. Chandra, the Google executive, said Home would add movie showtimes eventually. As for placing delivery orders, he said Google was working with other companies on designing an experience that works with voice. You wouldn’t want a voice assistant listing 50 menu items, for instance.Bottom line Right now, Echo’s major advantage is its ability to order items from Amazon.com and its broader smart home capabilities. If you like the idea of using a speaker to quickly reorder diapers or toilet paper, or if you are eager to get a speaker to control home accessories like lights and thermostats, Echo is a better product for you. But if you aren’t big on Amazon shopping and can wait a few months to see how Home evolves, Google’s speaker may be your long-term bet because of its smarter artificial intelligence and superior audio player. Home, priced at about $130, is also cheaper than Amazon’s $180 Echo, though Amazon offers a mini "Echo Dot" version for just $50. Let’s just hope Google eventually gives people more ways to talk to its speaker other than “OK, Google.” (The only other option is “Hey, Google.”) It gets so tedious that you may eventually say, “OK, I’m over this.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services FAQs Contact Us About Us Subscribe Now Vacation Stops/Restarts Manage My Account Submissions News Tips Calendar Events Obituaries Legal Notices Letter to the Editor Business News Announcements Advertising Display an Ad Special Publications Classified Ads Place an Ad Advertise With Us Online Services RSS Feeds Print Archives Mobile App Text Alerts Newsletters Digital Services for Business Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

About Us Our People Advertising News Sports Shows WV Poll Outdoors Column: Bigger fish on the line after KO’ing Kansas Share Article By Allan Taylor in News, Sports, WVU Sports | November 06, 2016 at 4:48AM Ben Queen-USA TODAY Sports Amid a two-touchdown performance, receiver Shelton Gibson whoofs it up during West Virginia’s 48-21 win over Kansas on Saturday night in Morgantown.   COMMENTARY MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — The game was only minutes old and Kansas still posed at least a mathematical threat when West Virginia misfired on third down. Headed to the sideline, receiver Shelton Gibson began taking noise from a Kansas defensive back he didn’t recognize. So Gibson chirped back, which is when the defender said, “You better Google me.” Huh? Gibson called it hands-down the worse comeback he ever heard and tried to suppress his laughter as a fire-spitting Dana Holgorsen tore into the slow-starting offense on the bench. Hours later, Gibson was finally free to laugh after catching two touchdowns in West Virginia’s 48-21 victory. “If I have to Google you then that’s a bad sign. I should already know who you are. That was so bad.” Gibson ID’d the Google guy as No. 9, and giggled again upon learning the number belongs to safety Fish Smithson. “His name is Fish? So if I Google ‘Fish’ I wonder what will pop up … Nemo?” That Smithson happens to be KU’s top tackler and interception leader carried no significance, because the Big 12’s most enfeebled program is lined with players unrecognizable outside its own locker room. One might actually have to Google “Kansas football” to learn anything about a team this devoid of talent and buzz. David Beaty, now wrapping up Year 2 of his career suicide mission, owns a 1-20 record. Shown the right amount of patience from KU’s administration, he might yet restore the Jayhawks to bowl-eligibility by the time we’re commuting in hovercrafts and setting the microwave by squinting. Until then, the Big 12’s worst football collective apparently will double as its worst trash-talkers. If you missed the opening kickoff, you missed another Jayhawks safety, Mike Lee, being penalized for taunting. On a touchback. All that swagger, yet Beaty ordered his quarterback to pooch punt on a fourth-and-2 at midfield. Kansas trailed 3-0 at the time and Beaty must have thought he was coaching in the LSU-Alabama slugfest as opposed to fronting a team whose defense yields 50 points per game on the road. Down 17-0, Beaty showed more aggression on fourth-and-short at the WVU 29 only to see quarterback Montell Cozart wrestled down by linebacker Al-Rasheed Benton shy of the marker. “It was just see ball, get ball,” Benton said. “They tried to overload us and get an extra blocker. (Cozart’s) a big guy and him falling forward will get him 2 or 3 yards, so you just want to get in there and stop his forward progress.” While Kansas football hasn’t shown forward progress since Mark Mangino was berating parking attendants, West Virginia finds itself charging with the lead pack in the Big 12 race. Gibson got his left foot down on a 40-yard sideline bomb to jumpstart the opening series, He got his right foot down while catching a 19-yarder in the rear of the end zone. He later ran 25 yards on a reverse. Then Gibson co-produced the night’s most exciting play — helping out his scrambling quarterback by criss-crossing the field to create the small window for a 32-yard touchdown pass. That play Gibson attributed to a scramble drill practiced regularly, whereby receivers mirror Skyler Howard sideline-to-sideline in an exhausting sequence that seemingly never ends. “We do that drill every week,” the receiver said. “Honestly, it makes us really tired, but you’ve just got to do it.” Same goes for drilling Kansas, which is the weekly norm for those at the top of this conference. West Virginia did its part Saturday, maintaining contender status as it prepares for bigger fish.

Casey | November 3, 2016 MORE $399.99 from Amazon Editors' rating: The Pros Runs Android apps; Excellent battery life; Sleek, premium-looking design; Comfortable keyboard The Cons Mediocre performance; Flat audio Verdict The Acer Chromebook R 13 combines an attractive design, long endurance and the ability to run your favorite Android apps. Review The big knock against Chromebooks -- the light, minimal alternative to MacBooks and PC laptops -- is that their software options are limited. The Acer Chromebook R 13 is one of the first notebooks to avoid that problem, as it offers (beta) support for the Android apps in the Google Play store. On top of that, it has long battery life, a comfy keyboard and an aluminum design that's quite slick for a $399 machine. As long as you don't need a lot of processing power, the Chromebook R 13 is a great choice. article continued below Design The Acer Chromebook R 13's aluminum chassis gives it an eye-catching look that made one of my co-workers mistake it for a MacBook Pro. Its 1080p display rotates to laptop, display, tent and tablet positions on a pair of hinges that offer enough tightness to keep it stable. The Chromebook R 13 weighs 3.2 pounds and measures 0.6 inches thick, which makes it thinner than the Lenovo ThinkPad 13 Chromebook (3.2 pounds, 0.8 inches) and the Dell Chromebook 13 (3.23 pounds, 0.7 inches). The 10-inch Asus Chromebook Flip is lighter (1.96 pounds, 0.6 inches), but that's to be expected at that size. Acer placed the R 13's USB Type-C port, HDMI port, USB 3.0 port and microSD card reader on the Chromebook's left side and the headphone jack and lock slot on its right side. That Type-C port is used mainly for charging, but it also supports USB 3.1 data transfer and DisplayPort monitors.  MORE: Best Acer Laptops Display The Chromebook R 13's 13.3-inch, 1080p panel shows crisp images but with unimpressive color and brightness. When I watched a trailer for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story on the notebook, I could see the tiny beads of rain on Orson Krennic's jacket as clearly as each strand of young Jyn Erso's hair. The glowing red lights in a freighter appeared strong, and blue skies rendered in a correct pale tone. But a Star Destroyer showed up in an off-white tone, and the panel gave rebel pilot jumpsuits a muted orange. The Chromebook R 13's panel displays only 64 percent of the sRGB spectrum. That's similar to the scores from the Asus Chromebook Flip (61 percent) and the ThinkPad 13 Chromebook (63 percent), but lower than those from the Dell Chromebook 13 (96 percent) and the ultraportable category average (82 percent). The colors the Chromebook R 13's display shows are still rather accurate for a notebook, earning a 1.1 (lower is better) on the Delta-E test. That's worse than the Asus Chromebook Flip's score (0.7), the same as the ThinkPad 13 Chromebook's showing (1.1), and better than the numbers from the Dell Chromebook 13 (1.4) and the average thin-and-light notebook (2.0). The Chromebook R 13's panel emits up to 254 nits (a measure of brightness), which is more than the average for thin-and-light notebooks (244 nits) and similar to the ThinkPad 13 Chromebook's 257 nits of brightness. However, it's lower than the scores from the Dell Chromebook 13 (270 nits) and the Asus Chromebook Flip (283 nits). I wish it were brighter, though, as its screen often showed my reflection during darker scenes. Keyboard, Touch Screen, Touchpad The Chromebook R 13's keyboard offers a lovely typing experience. Testing it out on the 10fastfingers.com typing test, I clicked my way to 75 words per minute, which is near my average (80 wpm). The convertible keys work so well because they feature 1.6 millimeters of travel and require 52 grams of force to actuate -- measurements near what we prefer (1.5 to 2 mm; 60 grams). As I scrolled through pages and played rounds of Fruit Ninja, the Chromebook R 13's 13.3-inch touch screen showed decent responsiveness, only lagging behind me when my finger reached a frenzied pace. Whether I was reading web pages or navigating through the user interface, the Chromebook R 13's 4.1 x 2.3-inch buttonless touchpad responded to my input quickly and accurately. Two-finger scrolling was smooth when I skimmed a Google Doc. Pressing down on the pad provided a comfortable click. Audio The Chromebook R 13's speakers didn't provide much volume in our tests, barely filling a small conference room with a mediocre rendition of Jidenna's "Long Live the Chief." While the convertible rendered the song's high-pitched synths clearly, it took the punch out of the track's bass and vocals.  MORE: Best 2-in-1s (Laptop/Tablet Hybrids) Performance Our review configuration of the Chromebook R 13 sports a MediaTek MT8173C processor and 4GB of RAM -- a combination that doesn't offer enough speed for smooth multitasking. The laptop ran speedily when I used only a few tabs (including Google Docs and Slack), but I noticed stuttering while scrolling through sites after I split the screen among a 1080p YouTube video and nine Chrome tabs. The $399 Chromebook R 13 scored a meager 59 on the JetStream benchmark for JavaScript performance. That's lower than the score from the $420, Intel Celeron-powered Dell Chromebook 13 (86) and far below that from the $800, Core i5-powered ThinkPad 13 Chromebook (171) and the average for thin-and-light notebooks (172), which includes more expensive Windows notebooks. The Chromebook R 13 also performed poorly on the WebGL Aquarium test, rendering 2,000 fish at a rate between 20 and 40 frames per second. The Dell Chromebook 13 (48 fps) and the Lenovo ThinkPad 13 Chromebook (60 fps) ran that animation more smoothly. The Chromebook R 13 beats the $259, Rockchip-powered Asus Chromebook Flip on two benchmark tests: the SunSpider JavaScript test (635.6 milliseconds versus 688.5 milliseconds, where shorter is better) and the Peacekeeper browser test (1,559 versus 1,425). We don't typically use those tests because they're no longer maintained, but these scores still show that the R 13 edges out the Flip in a head-to-head comparison. Battery Life The Chromebook R 13 goes the distance, lasting 11 hours on the Laptop Mag Battery Test (web surfing at 100 nits of brightness). That's longer than the ThinkPad 13 Chromebook (9:08), the Chromebook Flip C100P (9:19) and the average for thin-and-light notebooks (7:52), but shorter than the Dell Chromebook 13 (13:25). MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life Webcam The Chromebook R 13's 0.9-megapixel webcam shoots grainy images with poor color reproduction. When I tested it in our well-lit office, it made a red wall look orange and my purple shirt render as a mix of blue and gray. Heat The Chromebook R 13 manages heat well. After we streamed 15 minutes of HD video on the notebook, our heat gun recorded temperatures on its touchpad (80.5 degrees Fahrenheit), G & H keys (85.5 degrees) and underside (89 degrees) that didn't breach our 95-degree comfort threshold. Software The Chromebook R 13, as its name suggests, runs Chrome OS, Google's minimalist, cloud-based answer to the hefty macOS and Windows. This means you'll need an internet connection to do most things on it, though you can save documents for offline usage in Google's apps such as Docs and Sheets. Android Apps One of the biggest differences between the R 13 and other Chromebooks is that it's one of the few models, along with the Asus Chromebook Flip, that can run Android apps. To try this out, though, you'll need to switch the notebook to the Beta updates channel. Occasionally, the X button on the top-left corner of an app wouldn't respond to my taps, so I had to hold down on the program's icon at the bottom of the screen and select Close. When I tested this feature with some Android games -- the Chrome Web Store doesn't offer much for gamers -- I found mixed results. The Chromebook R 13 ran the casual pinball gaming title PinOut with no problem, but the more demanding Asphalt 8 racing game showed lag when I tried to turn a car by turning the tablet. MORE: Best Chromebooks Available Now Overall, I noticed apps performed more smoothly when I used them in windowed views; they stuttered in full-screen mode. This isn't a big surprise, as a warning message says, "This app may not work when resized." Unfortunately, apps automatically resize when the R 13's screen is folded into tablet mode, and there is no button to return to windowed mode. Bottom Line The Acer Chromebook R 13 is a very good piece of hardware for the price, and the combination of Android emulation and a long-lasting battery makes this convertible a seriously compelling option. Productivity users or heavy multitaskers should consider a Chromebook with a more powerful processor, such as the Lenovo ThinkPad 13 Chromebook or the Dell Chromebook 13. However, if you want a convertible Chromebook for a great price, the Chromebook R 13 is your best choice. Unfortunately, the options for touch-screen Chromebooks are limited. So although the Asus Chromebook Flip is a more affordable $259, it doesn't match the R 13's battery life or performance. The speedy, long-lasting Dell Chromebook 13 is on the list for eventual Android support, but it will be limited without a touch screen. The Acer Chromebook R 13, though, is an all-around solid option that shows a blueprint for future Chrome OS notebooks.

 Facebook's AI guru thinks DeepMind is too far away from the 'mothership' Sam Shead Nov. 6, 2016, 4:02 AM 8,943 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook AI Research director Yann LeCun.YouTube/USI Events DeepMind, the AI research lab in London that was acquired by Google in 2014 for a reported £400 million, faces one big problem, according to Professor Yann LeCun, who heads up Facebook’s AI research group. Notably, LeCun believes that DeepMind, which employs over 250 people and today sits under Alphabet (Google’s parent company), is too far away from California. "The challenge I think that DeepMind has is that it’s geographically separated from the mothership in California and that makes it very difficult to build technology that can be used in products," LeCun told Business Insider during an interview in London last week. "So it pushes DeepMind to some extent to try to survive on its own." DeepMind declined to comment on this story but it would likely argue that being based in the UK is not a barrier when it comes to working with product and research teams across Google and the rest of the Alphabet group. While DeepMind’s technology may not be prevalent in all of Google's products, the search giant announced in July that it had found one very important use for DeepMind's self-learning algorithms. Google said it has been able to reduce the energy consumption of its data centre cooling units — used to stop Google's self-built servers from overheating — by as much as 40% with the help of a DeepMind AI system. That's going to be quite a large saving, given Google said it used 4,402,836 MWh of electricity in 2014, equivalent to the average yearly consumption of about 366,903 US family homes, according to Bloomberg. DeepMind CEO and cofounder Demis Hassabis with Go champion Lee Se-Dol and Google cofounder Sergey Brin.Google LeCun said that DeepMind’s forays into building healthcare applications are an example of how the company is operating relatively independently. He also said that DeepMind it putting a big emphasis on communication and public relations because "that’s important for the group as a whole. Particularly if it’s more difficult for them them to produce products." Prior to Google’s acquisition of DeepMind, there were rumours that Facebook was also interested in buying the startup, which was cofounded in 2010 by Oxbridge graduates Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, along with UCL academic professor Shane Legg. When asked about the rumours and whether DeepMind would have been a good acquisition for Facebook, LeCun said: "You know, things played out the way they played out. There’s a lot of very good people at DeepMind." He added: "I think the nature of DeepMind eventually would have been quite a bit different from what it is now if DeepMind had been acquired by a different company than Google." Google and Facebook are competitors in some areas of their businesses but the companies are also working together to advance the field of AI. "It’s very nice to have several companies that work on this space in an open fashion because we build on each others ideas," said LeCun. "So whenever we come up with an idea, very often DeepMind will build on top of it and do something that’s better and vice versa.

A picture taken on September 21, 2016 shows a statue donated by Google during its inauguration in Montelimar, as Google decided to launch a new version of the android operating system called Android 7.0 or Nougat. File photo by Jeff Pachoud/ AFP WASHINGTON, DC, USA – Google's Android operating system captured a record-high 87.5% of the global smartphone market in the third quarter, a research firm said. The survey released Wednesday, November 2, by Strategy Analytics found Android's share increase from 84.1% in the same period a year ago, while Apple's iOS saw its share slip to 12.1% from 13.6%. "Android's leadership of the global smartphone market looks unassailable at the moment," said Strategy Analytics' Woody Oh. "Its low-cost services and user-friendly software remain attractive to hardware makers, operators and consumers worldwide." Oh added that the dominance of Android poses challenges for Google, which offers the system for free to manufacturers. "The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place," he said. The report said global smartphone shipments grew six percent from a year ago to 375.4 million in the quarter, the fastest growth rate for a year. According to the survey, the market share for other operating systems including Windows and BlackBerry fell to a minuscule 0.3 percent from 2.3 percent last year. "BlackBerry and Microsoft Windows Phone have all but disappeared due to strategic shifts, while (Samsung's) Tizen and other emerging platforms softened as a result of limited product portfolios and modest developer support," said Neil Mawston, executive director of the research firm. – Rappler.com Filed under:Android Nougat•Android OS•Android operating system•Google•mobile operating systems•Android HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

By Sarah Frier. Added by Agency Staff on 6 November 2016. Saved under World Tags: Evan Spiegel, Facebook, Google, Snapchat Tweet Snap (formerly Snapchat) amended its charter to ensure that its founders retain majority voting control after the company’s initial public offering, giving them more control than the founders at Facebook and Google had after those companies went public. Separately, Google quietly made an undisclosed investment in Snap. CEO Evan Spiegel and co-founder and chief technology officer Bobby Murphy together control about 74% of the company, according to an analysis by Equidate, a stock market for private technology companies. That compares with the 41% that Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin had after their IPO, and the 56% Mark Zuckerberg held after Facebook’s. Snap, formerly known as Snapchat, is asking public-market investors to back its management team and support their potential to build the next technology juggernaut. The company behind the social media app that’s wildly popular with teens and millennials is aiming to raise as much as US$4bn in an IPO that could value it at $25bn to $35bn, people familiar with the matter have said. This year, Snap is aiming for revenue of $350m. Snap plans to go public as early as March. The filing Monday in Delaware, which laid out the founders’ voting rights, indicates that the company is cleaning up its ownership structure in preparation. Google seems to approve. Alphabet’s growth equity division, previously called Google Capital, renamed itself to CapitalG on Friday. With the re-brand, the firm also disclosed a recent investment in Snap. A spokeswoman for CapitalG declined to share the total investment.

By Deepak BhadanaDeepak Bhadana Published Date 05 - Nov - 2016 | Last Updated 06 - Nov - 2016 Tweet   Lenovo Z2 Plus (Black, 64GB) 19999 Search giant Google has entered into an agreement with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for creating virtual tours for over 280 monuments across the country. The list of sites that will be covered by Google include famous Indian monuments such as the Taj Mahal, the Victoria Memorial and the Konark Sun temple among many others. Speaking about the development, Sanket Gupta, Program Manager for Google Maps told reporters, “We have a tie-up with ASI for 360 degrees virtual tour of 280 monuments across the country of which 30 are in West Bengal.” Gupta added that the virtual tours will be available in Google Maps. He said Google has launched an array of products in India like offline view of maps, live traffic alerts and inclusion of unknown places on the maps by local guides. Gupta said one billion people across the globe were using Google maps and India was amongst the top five. When asked about Google Street View, Gupta stated that some work needed to be done to convince the authorities to grant Google the permission to bring street view to India. “In India we are trying to work with the state and central levels for allowing Street View,” said Gupta. India's neighbours Bangladesh and Sri Lanka already have street view. The Ministry of Home Affairs had cited security concerns and rejected the proposal for application of the 360-degree street level panoramic imagery tools to places in India. Indian security agencies fear the presence of such image-based mapping information being freely can be used for reconnaissance for terror attacks or other such subversive acts. Google Street View is a technology featured in Google Maps and Google Earth that uses 360-degree street level panoramic images to provide panoramic views of places all around the world. Users can thus take virtual tours of places that they have never been to.

(Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images) Print Email Eder Campuzano | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Eder Campuzano | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 05, 2016 at 2:20 PM, updated November 05, 2016 at 10:38 PM comments Many Oregon voters have already returned their ballots, but plenty are still filling them out over the weekend just days before they're counted. Those who haven't yet made up their mind in the presidential race may have Googled a thing or two about Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton in the last full week before Election Day. Thanks to Google Trends, we've been able to take a look at what Beaver State voters searched for in the week leading up to Nov. 8. Here's what we found. As far as the candidates' popularity as raw search terms, Clinton edged Trump out consistently over the last seven days. But when the candidates are taken as topics — say, when Oregonians plugged in queries that were related to either candidate without searching for one or the other specifically — Trump tops Clinton by even wider margins. Google has a nifty tool that tells us the most popular terms paired with the candidates' names as well as which search phrases saw an uptick in queries over the seven-day period. These are some of the more popular Clinton- and Trump-related topics Oregonians searched. Conspiracy theories upon conspiracy theories Both Trump and Clinton are attached to search results that either connect them to conspiracy theories or point searchers to absurd stories about their opponent. One of the most bizarre may be Clinton's disproven connection to a so-called Satanic ritual called "spirit cooking." Right-wing conspiracy sites have relished in taking hacked emails from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta released by WikiLeaks and spinning individual notes into tall tales. The spirit cooking fiasco came about when InfoWars editor Paul Joseph Watson drudged up an email that referred to an art installation called "Spirit Cooking" and took it to mean that Clinton participated in food preparation rituals that involved bodily fluids. The note to Podesta — in which Clinton was neither sender nor recipient — was merely an invitation to a dinner in celebration of a Kickstarter campaign for the artist who created an art installation called "Spirit Cooking" in the late '90s. Other fake stories pertaining to the candidates include MSNBC correspondent Chris Matthews endorsing Trump, New York Police preparing to arrest Clinton for pedophilia and that the FBI will indict the Democratic nominee after an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. All of those stories were thoroughly debunked. (Or in the case of the last one, mistakenly reported by Fox News's Bret Baier.) Trump pens One of the stranger breakout searches is for a pen adorned with a plastic Trump head that spits out some of the Republican nominee's favorite quotes. The pen includes such phrases as, "I will be the greatest president that God ever created," "Our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid," and fan favorite, "We will have so much winning if I'm elected that you may get bored with winning." Beyonce Because of course, when Beyonce — in a pantsuit, no less — joins husband Jay-Z and Chance the Rapper for a get-out-the-vote concert, Google is bound to be swarmed by the Bey Hive. There's just no question about it. North Carolina polls The Tar Heel state saw a 4,650 percent increase in Google searches from Oregon in the last week, signaling our curiosity of how the election is going in one of the year's most high-profile swing states. Trump, Russia and illiteracy Alleged ties between Trump and Russian interest also garnered a sizable increase in Google searches over the last week. Much of that is due to reports that the FBI is sitting on information that ties the Republican nominee to interests in Moscow. FBI Director James Comey has reportedly refused to raise suspicion of any connections between Trump and Russia, which has earned him rebuke from Democrats in the wake of an internal investigation into the agency's records division, which allegedly fired off a series of pro-Trump tweets this week. In a less serious turn, the Oct. 31 episode of "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" inspired another popular Google query: Can Donald Trump read? The search term is in all likelihood an attempt by Oregonians to find a segment of Bee's show in which she takes one of Trump's favorite qualifiers — "a lot of people are saying" — and turns it on its head with footage from the Republican nominee's testimony during a recent deposition. The bit pairs video of Trump declining to read legal documents with Bee's commentary to offer the hilarious, probably false theory that the GOP standard-bearer may not be entirely literate. You can watch the segment below. (Warning: It contains some crude language.) It'll be interesting to see how Oregonians' search habits pivot on Nov. 9. With any luck, they'll be more interesting than "who won the presidency?" but less soul-crushing than what was likely the most popular election-related online query in 2000: "What's a chad?" --Eder Campuzano 503.221.4344 @edercampuzano ecampuzano@oregonian.com Most Read About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Back in 1997, internet content consumption primarily took place on desktop and laptop computers, while mobile devices were still at least another decade away before reaching mainstream popularity. With the realization that most people search on Google using mobile devices, the company has begun experimentation with switching to a mobile-first indexing methodology. This will be of particular interest to webmasters, depending upon the configuration of the websites under their management. Google acknowledged the significance of the undertaking, and said: "We understand this is an important shift in our indexing and it’s one we take seriously. We’ll continue to carefully experiment over the coming months on a small scale and we’ll ramp up this change when we’re confident that we have a great user experience." While mobile-responsive and dynamic serving sites should not require any changes, Google has made several suggestions for sites that maintain separate markup for mobile and desktop devices. Otherwise, sites optimized only for desktop consumption will continue to be indexed as they are now. For websites that do not currently offer a mobile-optimized experience, the news may inspire webmasters to quickly build and deploy a solution. However, Google recommended a more careful approach, as "a functional desktop-oriented site can be better than a broken or incomplete mobile version of the site."

Screen Rant You Are Reading: Fantastic Beasts Locations Added to Google Maps Share On Facebook Comments (1) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next Fantastic Beasts Locations Added to Google Maps By Jasmin Mohamed 11.05.2016 1 Comment 128 Shares 1 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them finally brings the wizarding world to life here in the United States. Set in 1926 New York City, Newt Scamander inadvertently unleashes terror as he’s passing through on his way back to the UK. North America’s Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry stands in Massachusetts, New York City makes for a much more interesting setting of magical creatures on the loose. The highly anticipated adaption has already been confirmed for at least five films ahead of the opening of the first. Other news surrounding the new franchise includes casting news that Johnny Depp will have a pivotal role in the second feature. But what has really set Fantastic Beasts apart is the emphasis of real world locations, including the sequel taking place in Paris. It’s always fun to see movie studios team up with big companies to provide fans with an interactive experience that extends beyond the theater walls. According to Google (h/t to CB), the WB and Google have done just that with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Pull up Google Maps, and type in “Fantastic Beasts, New York City,” and you’ll see two different locations pop up — The Goldstein Residence and The Blind Pig. Located just two blocks from Washington Square Park in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village, regular folk can explore the interior of The Blind Pig; which is a popular speak easy for Witches and Wizards. According to the pub’s description, “Underground speakeasy open to witches & wizards (if they know the secret knock). No-Maj? No Entry.” “No-maj,” is just another term for muggle, or non-magic people. Several blocks up, near Midtown, fans can also explore The Goldstein Residence, home to Porpentina and Queenie Goldstein. The sisters find themselves as allies to Newt as he traverses the city trying to undo the damage he’s done. In their tiny brownstone, we can get a look at their humble yet cozy home that is filled with surprisingly ordinary things. After exploring the world of 1926 New York (and reading reviews, The Blind Pig has an average 5-star rating!), pull up Google on any Android device and have a little fun. If your device is new enough, start with the “Okay, Google,” command, then speak those commands Harry Potter fans will recognize from Charms class. “Lumos” activates the flashlight, “Silencio” puts the phone into do not disturb/mute mode, and “Nox” will shut it down. Notably missing from the map is the Magical Congress of the United States of America, which is located in downtown New York’s famed Woolworth Building. Fantastic Beasts has recently dropped several new TV spots ahead of its main release.

Here are the top things you should know about the growing VR, AR, and MR markets. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 5, 2016 at 3:04PM There's been a lot of buzz in the tech world about virtual-, augmented-, and "mixed"-reality devices. All this talk about different digital "realities" is exciting, but it can also be confusing for investors who haven't been following these next-gen markets. Therefore, let's take a moment to review what those three markets actually consist of. Image source: Getty Images. Virtual reality Virtual reality (VR) devices immerse a user in a virtual world, which mostly blocks their view and perception of the outside world. Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that this market will grow from nearly nothing today to $30 billion by 2020. The hardware market mainly consists of tethered, mobile, and standalone devices. Tethered VR headsets, such as Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift, HTC's Vive, and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation VR, must be connected to a high-powered PC or gaming console. These devices generally offer the highest-end VR experiences and track a user's head position with optical sensors and lasers installed in "base stations" around the room. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently revealed several new tethered VR headsets that can track a user's head position by using internal sensors instead of base stations -- making it easier for multiple users to share the same physical space. Mobile VR headsets, such as Samsung's Gear VR and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cardboard, use smartphones as the "brains" of their devices. These devices are cheaper and less powerful than their tethered counterparts, but users' movements aren't restricted by wires or their proximity to a PC or console. Google Cardboard (L) and Gear VR (R). Image source: Company websites. Standalone VR headsets aren't widely available yet, but they could strike a balance between the power of tethered headsets with the convenience of mobile ones. Oculus VR's upcoming Santa Cruz headset will free the Rift from PCs for a fully wireless experience. Augmented and mixed reality Augmented reality (AR) devices project digital overlays over real-world objects. Niantic's Pokemon Go, which projects Pokemon into real-life environments with the smartphone camera, is an early example of AR gaming. Digi-Capital believes that the AR market could be worth $90 billion by 2020, thanks to the growth of AR apps on mobile devices. In the near future, depth-sensing cameras will probably accurately place digital creatures onto real-world surfaces such as tables and floors -- paving the way for all new gameplay possibilities. Google Glass was also an early attempt to "augment" a user's reality with digital information, but it flopped because of privacy concerns. Looking ahead, the most closely watched AR device is Microsoft's HoloLens, which detects surfaces and projects holographic images on top of them. Microsoft has already showcased how the device can be used for tabletop Minecraft, the creation of 3D designs, or even projecting a hologram of another person into your room. The development version of the HoloLens still costs $3,000, but it should cost a lot less when it's finally released to the general public. Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is also trying to reduce the price of these next-gen AR devices down with Project Alloy, an open-source standalone headset that also projects virtual objects onto real-world ones. That device is powered by Intel's RealSense depth-sensing camera and a sixth-generation Core processor. Mixed reality (MR) is a newer term that's often used interchangeably with AR. Headsets such as the HoloLens and Project Alloy are often called MR devices because they "mix" VR features of head and motion tracking with AR features of digital overlays on real objects. Nonetheless, they can still simply be called AR devices because they "augment" users' reality without immersing them in a "virtual" world. Watch the ecosystems and the suppliers As these markets grow, battles between ecosystems will erupt. Facebook is already expanding its Oculus Home platform on the Rift and Gear VR, Google is introducing its rival Daydream platform, and Microsoft plans to turn Windows 10 into a holographic platform for its upcoming VR headsets and HoloLens. Suppliers will also engage in fierce battles to provide the components. InvenSense, STMicroelectronics, and Bosch are battling each other to supply the gyroscopes and accelerometers that track users' movements. AMD and NVIDIA are already making gaming GPU cards much cheaper with low-end "VR ready" cards. A $120 billion market opportunity If all goes well, the combined VR and AR market might be worth about $120 billion by 2020. However, mainstream adoption could be tough if VR and AR devices are merely considered pricey toys for hardcore gamers and tech enthusiasts. Therefore, prices will need to drop and killer apps (on par with Pokemon Go) must emerge to pique the public's interest. If that happens, the VR market could become a new pillar of growth for many of the companies mentioned here.

Back in the '90s Garry Kasparov faced off against IBM's Deep Blue in chess (complete with accusations of cheating aimed at the machine), and just a little over half a year ago Google's AlphaGo AI beat Lee Sedol at the ancient Chinese game of Go. Both systems were victorious. But now DeepMind, the Google subsidiary behind AlphaGo, has its sights on more modern stuff, specifically the real-time strategy video game and esports darling StarCraft II. At Blizzcon in California yesterday, the company announced that it's working with StarCraft maker Blizzard Entertainment to create an API for artificial intelligence that'll be available to researchers and hobbyists alike sometime next year. StarCraft II already has an AI system, of course, but the difference is that it doesn't behave like a human in the way Google's DeepMind is supposed to. It has access to information human players do not and can issue orders to units that would be outside a human's field of view. Even at its most benign, it's technically still cheating. That's intimidating, sure, but StarCraft II's smashing success proves it's hardly insurmountable. Humans have even been known to beat it when it's augmented with artificial intelligence systems apart from DeepMind's, as when a Russian player going by the name of Djem5 managed to beat three AI bots designed by the University of Alberta last December. DeepMind wants something better—an AI that uses the same information humans do while using the same field of view, but one that does simply does it better than us in the style of AlphaGo or Deep Blue. It's a bigger challenge than it may sound, as the whole game board is always visible to the AI in chess or Go, but in StarCraft II it has to work with our limitations. "Computers are capable of extremely fast control, but that doesn’t necessarily demonstrate intelligence, so agents must interact with the game within limits of human dexterity in terms of 'Actions Per Minute,'" said DeepMind researcher Oriol Vinyals in a blog post yesterday. Vinyals said the firm's particularly interested in StarCraft II for the way its fast-paced juggle of resources and troop movements "provide a useful bridge to the messiness of the real world." In time, given enough data from its own efforts and from other researchers using its API, the lessons learned "could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks." A Kasparov-style showdown isn't likely anytime soon. Vinyals cautions in the post that "we're still a long way from being able to challenge a professional human player at StarCraft II," but then again, many commentators were sure AlphaGo wasn't quite ready to take on Sedol.

Going forward, Google’s index will primarily be crawling the mobile version of a site’s content to learn how it should be indexed in search. This is a considerable shift away from Google’s typical indexing practices, which involves crawling the desktop versions of web pages and indexing them in both mobile and desktop search results. Google illustrates the main issues with following the status quo: ”This can cause issues when the mobile page has less content than the desktop page because our algorithms are not evaluating the actual page that is seen by a mobile searcher.” While Google’s index will now be constructed of mobile documents, the company promises it will continue to deliver a great search experience no matter what device they’re using. What’s currently being referred to as an “experiment” is being carefully rolled out on a small scale over the next few months. After that time, Google will ramp up the experiment only when the company is satisfied it is providing the best search experience for everyone. Here are some quick tips from Google regarding this change: If you have a responsive site with identical content across mobile and desktop, you shouldn’t have to change anything. If you have a site where the primary content and markup is not identical across mobile and desktop, you should consider making some changes to your site. Make sure to serve structured markup for both the desktop and mobile version. Google recommends using the Structured Data Testing Tool to verify the equivalence of structured markup across desktop and mobile by typing the URLs of both versions into the Structured Data Testing Tool and comparing the output. When adding structured data to a mobile site, avoid adding large amounts of markup that isn’t relevant to the specific information content of each document. Use the robots.txt testing tool to verify that your mobile version is accessible to Googlebot. Sites do not have to make changes to their canonical links. If you are a site owner who has only verified their desktop site in Search Console, please add and verify your mobile version. If you only have a desktop site, Google will continue to index your desktop site just fine. If you are building a mobile version of your site, do not launch it until it’s ready. Google says: “a functional desktop-oriented site can be better than a broken or incomplete mobile version of the site.” Related Posts Search Live Coverage Carousel Comes to Google With Real-Time Indexing Google is Splitting its Search Index, Prioritizing Mobile over Desktop Google to Prioritize the Indexing of HTTPS Pages Matt Cutts Explains How To Let Google Know When There’s A Mobile Version Of A Page Bio Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Latest Posts Matt Southern Lead News Writer at Search Engine Journal Matt Southern has been the lead news writer at Search Engine Journal since 2013.

Australia were incredibly disciplined, they did all the little stuff right, but if you’re David Kidwell you’d be tearing you hair out after that. The ‘what-ifs’ will be reverberating around his skull in the hotel room tonight; his side showed the full gamut - the unfathomable skill and brilliance of Johnson, with the Jekyll and Hyde of kicks out on the full, kicks too deep across the ingoal, and conversion attempts inexplicably missed. At key moments players like Inglis and Thurston came up with the important tackles - don’t forget Isaac Luke was just inches from putting NZ in 10-6 down at half-time, but for Thurston’s tryline heroics. Moments like Taupau’s indiscipline in the tackle have let NZ down here - they were far better in patches than Australia, but also far worse - and it’s a victory for a more consistent Kangaroos performance, but far from emphatic. England would have watched this with interest, knowing they need to now beat Australia to make the Four Nations final. There will have been enough there to have interested Wayne Bennett - what a cracking final group game that will be. A great eighty minutes of league, and Kangaroos fans will be relieved. The old pros, too experienced and too good at all the one per-centers.

Well, you can’t fault the Kiwis for effort or heart - they gave absolutely everything and nearly conjured the miraculous. The Kangaroos run to hug and celebrate; they know they’ve got away with one. A great, tight battle - and if these are our finalists, then we’re set for a real treat. Super rugby league. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.54pm EDT 17:54 No try! 80 min: Johnson is held up! So we’re back at the 10m line with ONE more play for the Kiwis. Johnson has to restart, so he can’t feature. They spin left the Kiwis, go through the hands and Kata puts a dribbler through.. But Boyd bats dead, and the Kangaroos have held on! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.53pm EDT 17:53 80 min: They spin right, it’s in the hands of Johnson - he beats his opposite number - it’s three on two, you are kidding me, he hasn’t has he! Brilliant stuff, and Johnson cuts through a gap - and crosses the line - but has he grounded it?! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.51pm EDT 17:51 79 min: We’ve got a blockbuster here - Kiwis try to put together a good six, but they can’t find a hole. Johnson probes, looks to find the ingoal, and Ferguson happily takes the restart. Kiwis with two, maybe three carries - before the hooter. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.49pm EDT 17:49 Try! Australia 14-8 New Zealand (Rapana) 77 min: Well, well, well! People keep asking for some Shaun Johnson magic, and would you believe it - he’s delivered! Absolutely lovely chip and chase - the bounce was awful but the mercurial halfback just scoops it in, brilliantly. Throws a no-look pass to Kenny-Dowall who feeds Rapana. Great play, NZ. Johnson with the chance at the extras from the conversion - but having done the hard stuff, the halfback’s missed with the easy bit! Updated at 6.13pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.46pm EDT 17:46 75 min: Thurston is injured in backplay, but it’s a loose effort from the Kiwis - they try to force a pass, but fortuitously it’s Australia that are penalised for a knock on. Kiwis with a scrum and half an opportunity - but oh deary me. They’ve attempted a kick straight away, and that’s not even close. Expect ‘game management’ from Smith to come into full effect here, as Australia just eat up metres, and time. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.44pm EDT 17:44 73 min: Australia do well to prevent the Kiwis getting out, and it’s a non-descript kick which allows Valentine Holmes to wind up with the return. Easy metres and the Kangaroos are threatening again. Thaiday held on the last - NZ need to go 90m now if they want to cross here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.42pm EDT 17:42 Penalty! Australia 14-4 New Zealand 71 min: No mistake from JT and it’s Australia by 10 points. Merrin with strong metres, Thurston kicks over the line, forcing Rapana to turn and scramble. NZ restart from about 5m out. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.40pm EDT 17:40 69 min: Oh no, Leuluai with a lose pass about 25m out, and who swoops - Ferguson again! Australia with a set of six in a really dangerous position. Blair penalised trying to get back from a tackle - that’s a coach killer after five good defensive tackles - and curiously Australia point to the sticks. What good will two extra do here - is it just to wind the clock? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.37pm EDT 17:37 67 min: All set for a classic Australian grind out here as the clock begins to become a factor for the Kiwis. If they start to chance their arm too much they’ll open themselves up to a counter-punch. Smith with a trickling grubber, picked up on NZ’s 10m line. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.36pm EDT 17:36 64 min: Johnson kicks off balance and it’s out on the full. Australia with an opportunity from about 20m out after a strong hit-up from Scott. Kangaroos go to the skies, but it’s well defused. NZ restart and spread left. Great offload and Luke makes great metres through the centre - a series of good rolling footy - real razzle-dazzle stuff from the Kiwis - but they’re pinged for a forward pass! Noo, the commentators are convinced, but I’m not. Especially off the back of such a lovely passage of league - it’s a lose ball, falling over the shoulder as a player is tackled; surely you can give benefit of the doubt to the attackers? Not so. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.32pm EDT 17:32 No try! 62 min: Blake Ferguson is having an absolute stormer - does brilliantly to cross in the corner - but would you believe it, it’s been called for a forward pass! Replays suggest rightly so, what a reprieve. Updated at 6.15pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.30pm EDT 17:30 60 min: Kiwis with a scrum feed and they spread nicely to the right. Good strong running from Johnson and Kahu. Good kick from Johnson puts Ferguson right inside his ingoal, but the massive winger beats about seven players to make his way back into the field of play! Heroic effort - and to compound the matter, the Kiwis are penalised in the first tackle. Such pivotal moments, this one is turning into a game of tiny margins. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.27pm EDT 17:27 58 min: They spread wide, hit the right and Johnson might put Kenny Dowall through - but oh no! The centre’s put it down! Big turnover there, NZ with half a sniff. Some of those early handling errors creeping back into this one? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.26pm EDT 17:26 56 min: Great strong metres up the centre from you guessed it, Klemmer and Cordner. Also Gillett with a scamper but the closing kick is too deep and Kahu marks the bombed attempt ingoal. Kiwis restart from the 20m. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.24pm EDT 17:24 Penalty!

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.23pm EDT 17:23 52 min: Careless from Taupau - he’s given away a needless penalty for a swinging arm after the tackle on Thaiday. Will this cost his side? Another massive run from Klemmer, and all of a sudden this has set up nicely for Australia. The Kiwis hold on, but literally, and are penalised - Tohu Harris the man pinned, and Cameron Smith points to the sticks. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.20pm EDT 17:20 50 min: Well. Cameron Smith gives his men a proper bollocking in backplay while that kick was being taken. Didn’t do a lot wrong there, the Kangaroos, but they find themselves in a contest again. Updated at 5.21pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.19pm EDT 17:19 Try! Australia 10-4 New Zealand (Kata) 48 min: Ferguson gets caught at marker and Kiwis look to exploit their numerical advantage out wide. Solomone Kata makes a charge for the line but he’s met by three in green & gold; they try to hold him, but he’s too strong. Great work from the Warriors centre - and we’re back on! Johnson with a difficult one from wide, but it drifts astray. No extras - a converted try the difference. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.16pm EDT 17:16 48 min: Smith penalised for holding on too long, and now the Kiwis get a good look here. On the second about 25m out. What can they conjure. Johnson kicks early, it’s played at by Australia - six again - and only 15m out! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.14pm EDT 17:14 46 min: O’Neill runs into an absolute wall of black - three in the tackle there. Strong metres from Cordner again, he’s been impressive - and almost puts Morgan into a whole. Meanwhile the Kangaroos spin to test the Kiwi’s left edge defence but it’s a poor pass from Gillett and we have a turnover. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.12pm EDT 17:12 44 min: Johnson runs on the last, brilliant defence from JT who not only chases the kicker, but then somehow also retrieves the chipped kick and passes off to Boyd who’s tackled on his own 30m. Updated at 5.12pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.10pm EDT 17:10 42 min: Slow going coming out from the Kiwis, after 5 tackles they’re still stuck in their own 40m. Kick away is decent, but Australia take the first tackle only just inside their own half. The early pressure is coming from Australia therefore, although nobody reads JT’s inside grubber, and the Kiwis deal comfortably. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.08pm EDT 17:08 Second half: Australia 10-0 New Zealand 40 min: Kangaroos to restart and straight away it’s a strong carry from Klemmer. He’s an axe, this kid. Cordner also with good metres before Thurston gets a steady kick away. NZ restart from about 5m out.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.02pm EDT 17:02 Looking at some of these half-time highlights, the Kiwis sure had some great half-chances. All the talk is about Shaun Johnson - but it’s a lot of pressure on one man’s shoulders. Who else can be the X-factor if NZ are to try and snatch this? Updated at 5.03pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.56pm EDT 16:56 So! Catch your breath if you can - what did you make of that? Perhaps the Coventry chill was getting to some of these warm-blooded mammals early on, because there was some uncharacteristically sloppy basic errors to start. New Zealand especially looked ropey in defence, dropping tackles and allowing Australia to make some easy busts. When they conceded the second try you thought it could turn into a procession; but thereafter the Kiwis galvanised, and but for a few millimetres and some strong work from JT could have gone in 10-6. This one’s definitely not dead therefore, let’s see how the second stanza unfolds. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.51pm EDT 16:51 Half-time: Australia 10-0 New Zealand 40 min: Yes, they can. Great defence. The Kiwis get a strong kick away and the siren/hooter sounds/bellows. An action-packed first forty! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.49pm EDT 16:49 39 min: After the drama of that little passage, suddenly we’re up the other end again - some tired bodies falling away from tackles, and Klemmer crosses.. but he’s held up! 20m restart - can the Kiwis hold on, right in the shadow of half-time? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.48pm EDT 16:48 37 min: Kiwis giving this a red hot go just before halftime. Some great carries through the centre, before Isaac Luke goes agonisingly close to crossing! Johnson jinks left, jinks right - he puts his hooker into a half-hole but JT does just enough, and possibly also the padding from the post stops Luke’s momentum. What an unlucky break for NZ, and the Roos hold on. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.45pm EDT 16:45 35 min: Klemmer with a strong run - almost didn’t recognise him with actual hair. This is a borderline afro, for those more accustomed to his NSW Blues shaved noggin look. JT grubbers through but Rapana does excellently to get back into the field of play. A good little period this - the Kiwis have come back into the contest, they’re fighting well. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.42pm EDT 16:42 33 min: No says the video ref! O’Neill just millimetres short of the line. Great scrambling defence and desperation from the Kiwis - if they conceded a third it almost certainly would have been a real body blow. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.41pm EDT 16:41 32 min: Good metres again from Cordner, here’s running hard and straight with his distinctive upright carriage. Brilliant quick-thinking from Thurston, he kicks through for O’Neill - he slides for the line; is he over? This would be heartbreaking for Kiwi fans! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.38pm EDT 16:38 30 min: Big break by O’Neill, and the Roos are looking lively again. Kiwis doing much better defensively, and it’s a misunderstanding from Australia and they bomb the pass. Kiwis with a chance to put together a better six. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.37pm EDT 16:37 28 min: Taumalolo with a solid run up the guts, Kata comes inside for a run. Bromwich offloads for Johnson, but again he’s put that one far too deep. These ingoals are tiny! You wonder if the players had a good look at that pre-game, because that’s a set of six just thrown away. New Zealand’s Jason Taumalolo is stopped by the Australian defence. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters Updated at 5.00pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.35pm EDT 16:35 26 min: Kata pinned for a dangerous tackle - no malice, just one of those that gets out of control. Another opportunity for the Roos, as if they need an invitation. Boyd rushes for the corner, but NZ hold on - better defence from the men in black & white. Smith with the final play kick, but that one wasn’t flash, and the Kiwis survive. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.33pm EDT 16:33 24 min: Smith almost puts Merrin in, before the Kiwis rush out to stop Morgan. Great inside grubber for JT, but it’s carried into touch and it’s six again. Great pressure here, Kiwis have to hold on. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.31pm EDT 16:31 22 min: Thurston with an excellent kick to the corner, he turns around Beale and earns a repeat six with Ferguson wrapping up his opposite number ingoal. Six again, Kangaroos. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.30pm EDT 16:30 19 min: And as so often happens, after failing to cross the Kiwis now find themselves right on the back foot. Aaron Woods charges for the line and almost loses his shorts in the process. You’ll be happy you missed that little cameo, dear readers. This is going end-to-end! As the Roos push it wide, looking to find Holmes with a cutout it’s Rapana who plucks the intercept and runs 40m. Inglis with a desperate attempt at an ankle tap and just slows the winger. But with a great opportunity beckoning the Kiwis duff the pass. Horrible ball to Johnson, who puts it down and the moment’s lost. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.27pm EDT 16:27 16 min: Smith kicks early to keep the Kiwis on their own line. But it’s a relieving penalty against Trent Merrin and NZ restart from about 30m out. Some of the line markings are a bit confusing, the residual lines from a football (soccer) game remain - it’s the Kiwis charging up to the six-yard box. Huge hit! Inglis charges out of the line and lines up the fullback Kahu - looked a good tackle, but we pause for replays to see if it was high. Nope, the refs are happy. Kiwis spin to the left, real chance here, they need to strike back - but the last play kick runs deep! Very short in-goals here, kickers will have to note that, it really affects your final play options. Updated at 4.27pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.22pm EDT 16:22 Try! Australia 10-0 New Zealand (Thurston) 14 min: Deary me, the Kiwis defence is at sixes and sevens - great bust by Cordner to start it, then it’s a lovely show-and-go from Morgan, draws far too much interest from two, three players to put Ferguson into a hole. He charges at the line and offloads, and who’s there to back up? Well, you knew without asking, didn’t you, JT. This time he’s successful with the kick from a slightly kinder angle - Australia with all the early running. Johnathan Thurston, centre, celebrates scoring the second try for Australia. Photograph: Ed Sykes/Reuters Updated at 4.59pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.19pm EDT 16:19 13 min: Holmes now puts down a swirling bomb - gee, there are some errors out there so far! Boyd does well to recover, and the danger is averted. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.18pm EDT 16:18 11 min: Incidentally, if you missed the earlier clash, England ran out comfortable winners over Scotland 38-12. I was reminded of that because of the poor Scottish kicker - missed three from three. Meanwhile, back on the field a great dart, this time on the opposite flank and it’s Holmes busting away. They’re opening them up on the flanks are the Roos. Once again though, it’s Australia who force a pass and they neutralise their own advantage with a dropped ball. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.16pm EDT 16:16 Try! Australia 4-0 New Zealand (Ferguson) 9 min: Great angled dart from Morgan, he’s pulled down about 5m out. But the Kiwis are again penalised! Too long holding on, Johnson prevents the five-eighth from playing, and Australia are given another six from 10m out. They spread wide, NZ are short of numbers and Ferguson does well to stand up one or two and crosses comfortably in the corner. JT lines up the conversion from right on the touchline. No dice - just to the right of the uprights. Blake Ferguson scores the first try for Australia. Photograph: Ed Sykes/Reuters Updated at 4.58pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.13pm EDT 16:13 8 min: First penalty of the game, Proctor pinged for hanging on too long in the tackle. Smith kicks for touch, and they start this set about 30m out. What can they muster? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.12pm EDT 16:12 6 min: Kiwis spread it wide for the first time, Kenny Dowall with it in the hands, before a lovely little cameo from Johnson. Straight away though it’s Ferguson with the first bust of the game - great run from the winger, he picks up 60m before being hauled down. Next play, would you believe it, big GI puts it down cold. Turn over and what a let off! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.10pm EDT 16:10 5 min: Strong defensive work again from the Kiwis, quite a few players wearing skins under their jerseys - quite a different look for those that follow the NRL, it could be a tough nippy in Coventry for this night-time kick off. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.08pm EDT 16:08 3 min: Kiwis with the marginally sharper start, they’re enjoying slightly better field position, but it’s a disappointing kick to close and some pressure is relieved as Kangaroos bring out from about 15m out. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.06pm EDT 16:06 Kick-off: Australia 0-0 New Zealand 1 min: And we’re away, Kiwis receive.

Updated at 4.06pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.03pm EDT 16:03 Anthems well observed. Quite bizarrely there was a very karaoke-esque backing track on the New Zealand anthem. Even some dirty bass grinding in. Very odd. Flags, choirs and children ushered away - the Kiwis are circling up for the Haka which means we are in for business. No matter how many times you watch one of these they still remain spine-tingling.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.47pm EDT 15:47 Preamble Like Sparta and Athens, Australia v New Zealand is a rivalry for the ages. Sure, both nations are only a few hundred years old, and part of their respective national identities were forged together on the beaches of Turkey. They may have also competed together under a shared flag at the Olympics but I promise you - when it comes to rugby league this remains a proper ding dong. Australia may have come comfortably past Scotland in their opening match, whereas New Zealand only just squeaked past Wayne Bennett’s England by one point. That all matters for nearly nothing as both sides know a win here will virtually book a spot in the Four Nations final. Earlier in the year the Kangaroos were almost comfortable in knocking over the Kiwis twice, but you’d need a short memory to forget the dramatic group stage win by the New Zealanders at the 2014 Four Nations, matched only by the tectonic clash that then followed in the final.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google aims to help developers, make more apps interesting with Playtime By R Padla - November 5, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google is making Play more fun and exciting. If you’re familiair with Playtime (no, not that Playtime Pad), a series of developer events, you’d be happy to know that Google is getting busy once again. The company has helped a lot of developers already. More businesses have expanded and the tech giant continues by launching events in different countries. In the United States, Google is set to launch new programs and tools that hopefully will make our mobile and digital lives better. Google Play is extending from smartphones and tablets to more devices like the Chromebook and a VR headset. The Daydream is a new platform that makes virtual reality more accessible to the masses. VR apps will be available soon on the Google Play Store. On the Chromebook, the Play Store is supported but still on beta on some devices. Most Android apps should run but there may be limits. On the wearable arena, Android Wear 2.0 is now on developer preview phase and should be ready soon. Google aims to bring the right tools and features for all app developers with the Play Developer Console. Hopefully, this will help developers cash in on and increase user engagement of their apps. Another helpful way to increase revenue is offering a service with subscription. More and more developers are using this business model and now you can offer as low as $1 per month, at least for the first few months. Free trials can be offered but offering a premium will help these developers get more relevant, target, and quality subscriber base. Pre-registration can also be useful as it helps build anticipation for a new game or title. Early Access canbe offered and this way, developers can know what to improve from the beta build. Google also announced that there’s a new API that can help developers to identify users requested for refunds. The feature is still in beta mode but should be available for all developers soon.

 I just spent a day in a mindfulness program developed at Google and left with 5 key lessons Shana Lebowitz Nov. 5, 2016, 3:20 PM 20,115 facebook linkedin twitter email print Search Inside Yourself teaches participants to reckon with difficult emotions. Caleb Roenigk/Flickr About five minutes before Search Inside Yourself was scheduled to start, I was running through New York City's Flatiron District, using half my mouth to chew a blueberry muffin and the other half to curse the fates for letting me oversleep by an hour. It was a fitting start to a day of mindfulness training. Search Insider Yourself (SIY) is a two-day program that teaches participants skills around mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and resilience. It was originally developed at Google, by the company's 107th employee, Chade-Meng Tan (a.k.a. the "Jolly Good Fellow"). Today, Tan no longer works at Google, where the program continues. But he sits on the board of the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute, which offers public SIY programs across the globe. (If you can't make it to a public SIY program, you can also download the free app Whil, which offers a digital version.) SIYLI invited me to participate in (and comped my admission to) the $1,250 New York City program in November. I attended the first day of the program, where about 100 people, some from as far away as Ethiopia, learned mindfulness practices and the benefits behind them. For me, the class was a much-needed opportunity to stop running, chewing, and cursing, and really notice what was happening — both around and inside me. Below, I've rounded up the insights from SIY that most resonated with me. 1. It's impossible to 'fail' at meditation One of the two SIY teachers who led the program, Laurie Cameron, debunked the myth that if you keep getting distracted while sitting, meditation isn't for you. Instead, she recommended thinking of meditation as training your mental muscles and each distraction that arises as an opportunity to do a "mental rep." Here's how it works: You start out by following your breath. A distraction arises. You notice the distraction. You reorient your attention to the breath. One rep down. While those distractions can be frustrating, it's important to treat yourself with kindness and to reorient your attention as gently as possible. 2. Talking about emotions differently can help you deal with them in a more productive way Robert Chender, the other SIY teacher, said there are two ways to handle emotions. One is the existential way: "I am angry." The other is the physiological way: "I experience anger in my body." That second framing might sound weird — but if you think about emotions that way, at least in your own head, it's somewhat freeing. Your emotions are no longer all-consuming entities that guide your choices; they're transient states. Think of emotions, Cameron added, as "passing through me like a cloud." It's the difference between being inside an emotion or stepping outside of it, Cameron said when we spoke by phone later that week. You don't let your emotions define you. At the SIY session in New York City. Shana Lebowitz/Business Insider 3. You can get better at acknowledging your emotions before they spiral out of control "Emotions are actually feelings in the body," Chender explained. The key is recognizing when you're experiencing a particular bodily sensation. One way to do that is a body scan. Starting at the top of your head, check in with every part of your body and notice what it feels like. That way, you can catch any simmering negative feelings before you act on them. For example, maybe your cheeks are hot, or your fists are clenched. You might be experiencing anger. Cameron told me that the more you practice tuning into your bodily sensations, the better you'll get at identifying them. At first, it might take you an hour to realize that you were experiencing anger. At some point, though, you'll be able to realize what's going on while you're experiencing that anger. Then you can label the emotion as such, which can help decrease its intensity. Finally, you can tap into your thinking brain to figure out what to do next, instead of acting out of extreme anger, or sadness, or whatever it is you're experiencing. 4. When you're feeling a difficult emotion, the best thing to do is pause Cameron and Chender taught the SBNRR technique for dealing with emotions in tense situations: Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond. Here's how it would play out if you were in a meeting and someone announced that you did something wrong: Stop: Don't say anything just yet. Breathe: Take a deep breath. Notice: Observe the feelings you're experiencing, for example anger or defensiveness. Observe any physical sensations, for example weakness or nausea. Reflect: Figure out what the underlying feeling is: Maybe you're doubting yourself, or maybe you feel vulnerable. Respond: Choose to act in a way that makes logical sense. Again, it takes practice to get good at this technique. Eventually, it won't take several minutes to SBNRR; it'll be your automatic pattern as soon as something triggers you. You can also practice SBNRR on your own by mentally replaying a stressful situation and thinking about how you could have handled it differently. 5. Treat others — and yourself — with kindness Chender led a practice called "open awareness," which trains you to focus deeply on the present. You notice and welcome whatever comes your way — sounds, smells, and feelings, for example. At one point during the practice, Robert instructed SIY participants to treat all these stimuli with kindness and openness "because you are a very good and kind person." That idea of showing yourself compassion, of recognizing the person you're trying to be, struck me as both important and undervalued. Cameron told me that meditation isn't just about training your attention — it's also about training the way you speak to yourself. We all have an inner voice that can sometimes be critical, Cameron said. "With mindfulness, we learn to develop awareness of that voice in the head and we can learn to talk to ourselves with kindness instead of scolding or self-judgment."

Sander Venema Menu Skip to content Home Talks TV About Why I won’t recommend Signal anymore One of the things I do is cryptography and infosec training for investigative journalists who have a need to keep either their sources and communications confidential so they can more safely do their work in the public interest. Often they work in places which are heavily surveilled, like Europe, or the United States. Ed Snowden’s documents explain a thing or two about how the US intelligence apparatus goes about its day-to-day business. They sometimes also work in places in the world where rubber hose cryptanalysis is more common than in say the U.S. or Europe. Which is why crypto tools alone are not the Alpha and the Omega of (personal) security. This requires careful consideration of what to use when, and in what situation. One of the things I have recommended in the past for various cases is the OpenWhisperSystems’ app called Signal, available for Android and iOS. In this article, I want to explain my reasons why I won’t be recommending Signal in the future. To be clear: the reason for this is not security. To the best of my knowledge, the Signal protocol is cryptographically sound, and your communications should still be secure. The reason has much more to do with the way the project is run, the focus and certain dependencies of the official (Android) Signal app, as well as the future of the Internet, and what future we would like to build and live in. This post was mostly sparked by Signal’s Giphy experiment, which shows a direction for the project that I wouldn’t have taken. There are other, bigger issues which deserve our attention. What is Signal? Signal is an app published by OpenWhisperSystems, a company run by Moxie Marlinspike. It has published an official Signal app for Google Android, and Apple iOS. Signal has been instrumental in providing an easy-to-use, cryptographically secure texting and calling app. It is a combination of the previously separate apps TextSecure and Redphone, which were combined into one app called Signal. One of the main reasons why I recommended it previously to people was that it was easy to use, next to the cryptographic security. This is one good thing Signal has going for it. People could just install it and then communicate securely. Cryptographic software needs to be much more simple to use, and use securely, and Signal is doing its thing on the mobile platforms to create an easy-to-use secure messaging platform. I do appreciate them for that. I wanted to get that out of the way. Multiple problems with Signal There are however, multiple issues with Signal, namely: Lack of federation Dependency on Google Cloud Messaging Your contact list is not private The RedPhone server is not open-source I’ll go into these one at a time. Lack of federation There is a modified version of Signal called LibreSignal, that removed the Google dependency from the Signal app, allowing Signal to be run on other (Android) devices, like CopperheadOS, or Jolla phones (with Android compatibility layer). In May this year, however, Moxie made it clear that he does not want LibreSignal to use the Signal servers, and that he does not approve of the name. The name is something that can change, that is not a problem. What is a problem, however, is the fact that he does not want LibreSignal to use the Signal servers. Which would be fine if he allowed LibreSignal to federate across using their own servers. This was tried once (Cyanogenmod, and also offered to Telegram, of all people) but subsequently abandoned, because Moxie believes it slows down changes to the app and/or protocol. The whole problem with his position however, is that I don’t see the point of doing any of this secure messaging stuff, without having federation. The internet was built on federation. Multiple e-mail providers and servers for instance, can communicate effortlessly with one another, so I can send an e-mail to someone who has a Gmail address or a corporate address, etc. without effort and it all works. This works because of federation, because the protocols are all open standards and there are multiple implementations of the standards who can cooperate and communicate together. Another example would be the Jabber/XMPP protocol, which also has multiple clients on multiple platforms who can communicate securely with one another, despite one having a Jabber account on another server than the other. If we don’t federate, if we don’t cooperate, what is there to stop the internet from becoming a bunch of proprietary walled gardens again? Is the internet then really nothing more than just a platform for us to use certain proprietary silo services on? Signal then, just happens to be a (partly proprietary) silo on which your messages are transmitted securely. Dependency on Google Cloud Messaging Currently, the official Signal client depends on Google Cloud Messaging to work correctly. The alternative that has been developed by the people of LibreSignal has removed that dependency, so people running other software, like Jolla or CopperheadOS can run Signal. Unfortunately, the policy decisions of OpenWhisperSystems and Moxie Marlinspike make it so that it became impossible to reliably run unofficial Signal clients that use the same server infrastructure, so people can communicate. Also, federation, like explained in the previous section, is expressly hindered and prohibited by OpenWhisperSystems, so it is not an option for LibreSignal to simply run their own servers and then federate within the wider Signal network, allowing people to contact each other across clients. What is Google Cloud Messaging? The Google Cloud Messaging service is used by Signal with empty messages in order to wake up the device before the actual messages are pushed to the device by Signal’s servers.[1] There is a way to use Signal without depending on GCM, but that uses microg, and that asks people to basically re-compile their kernel (at least I had to in my case). This is not something you can ask of non-technical users. I would like to be able to run an official Signal client (or any secure messaging client) on hardware that runs CopperheadOS for example. Unrelated to GCM directly, but since on Android devices, Google usually has root access to the phone, there’s the issue of integrity. Google is still cooperating with the NSA and other intelligence agencies. PRISM is also still a thing. I’m pretty sure that Google could serve a specially modified update or version of Signal to specific targets for surveillance, and they would be none the wiser that they installed malware on their phones. For this reason it would also be strongly preferable to run a secure messaging client on a more secure platform. Currently when it comes to Signal this cannot be done in any official way, and it would help for the people who really need secure messaging services (instead of the people who merely use it as a replacement of say WhatsApp), if the software runs on other Android distributions, like Copperhead.[2] Your contact list (social graph) is not private Here is the permission list of Signal, including OpenWhisperSystems’ explanation for the need for them. As you can clearly see, Signal is allowed (if you install it), to read and modify your contacts. Signal associates phone numbers with names in a similar way that Whatsapp is doing, and this is a big reason why they feel they need to read your contact list. Also, there’s a usability thing where they display the contacts’ names and pictures in the Signal app. It hashes them before sending them to the server, but since the space of possible hashes is so small for phone numbers, this does not provide a lot of security. Moxie has stated previously (in 2014) that the problem of private contact discovery is difficult, lays out different strategies that don’t work or do not give satisfying performance, and then admits it’s still an unsolved problem. Discussion regarding this seemed to have moved from a Github issue to a mailing list, and I don’t know of any improvement on this front.[2] This could of course all been done differently, by using usernames to connect users instead of their phone numbers (incidentally, this would also allow people who use multiple phone numbers on the same device to use Signal reliably). And last time I checked, if you use the same phone number on a different device, Signal will get deregistered on the old device. Another issue, and a plus for using usernames, is that you may want to use Signal with people you don’t necessarily want to give your phone number to. And federation would also be easier with usernames, and servers, separated by a symbol, like the @. Just like in the case of Jabber/XMPP. I also see no usability issues here, as even very non-technical people generally get the concept of an address, or an e-mail address, and this would be very similar. RedPhone not open source The phone component of Signal is called RedPhone. The server component of this is unfortunately not open source (so people are prevented from running their own phone servers, and this is also probably the reason why secure encrypted phone calls don’t work in e.g. LibreSignal.) I don’t know exactly what prevents the RedPhone server code from being released (whether it is legal issues or simple unwillingness), but I do think it is strange that there is no movement whatsoever to move to a different/alternative solution, that respects users’ rights. Moving forward The big question now, as also said by @shiromarieke on Twitter, is what post-Signal tool we want to use. I don’t know the answer to that question yet, but I will lay out my minimum requirements of such a piece of software here. We as a community need to come up with a viable solution and alternative to Signal that is easy to use and that does in fact respect people’s choices, both in the hardware and software that they choose to run. In my view, there should be a tool that is fully free software (as defined by the GNU GPL), that respects users’ freedoms to freely inspect, use, modify the software and distribute modified copies of the software. Also, this tool should not have dependencies on corporate infrastructure like Google’s (basically any partner in PRISM), that allows these parties to control the correct working of the software. The fact that Signal depends on Google Cloud Messaging, and Google technology in general is something that should be avoided. In the end, I think we need to move to an Internet where there are more federated services, not less, where information is openly shared, and services publicly run by multiple people all over the world. Otherwise, we’ll be in danger of ending up in an neo-90s Internet, with walled gardens and pay walls all over the place. You already see this trend happening in journalism. We need to remember that we’re fighting not only against government surveillance, but also against corporate surveillance as well. We need ways to defend against this, and using corporate solutions that create a dependency on these solutions, even if the communications themselves are not readable to them, there’s still the issue of metadata, and of course general availability of Google’s services to Signal. It’s really unfortunate that OpenWhisperSystems isn’t more friendly to initiatives like LibreSignal, since these people did a lot of work which is now basically going to be thrown away because the person running Signal is not friendly to these initiatives. We need to cooperate more as a community instead of creating these little islands, otherwise we are not going to succeed in defeating or even meaningfully defending against Big Brother. Remember, our enemy knows how to divide and conquer. Divide et impere. It’s been a basic government subjugation tactic since the Roman times. We should not allow our own petty egos and quest for eternal hacker fame to get in the way of our actual goal: dismantling the surveillance states globally. Notes: [1]: An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that GCM was used to transport Signal messages. While correct for a previous version of TextSecure, this is in fact not correct anymore for Signal. I’ve updated it, in response to this HN comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12882815. [2]: Clarified my position re Google and GCM and the contact list / private contact discovery issue a bit.

While Newt isn't afforded such luxuries, it doesn't mean ou can't use them to explore a bit more of his world. Google has joined up with Fantastic Beasts on a multitude of platforms, including Google Maps. Clicking here will pull up distinct locations from the universe and explore them in street view. The first is the Magical Congress of the USA, located at the Steen National Bank, but if you want something a bit less formal, you can head over to The Blind Pig, the underground bar of choice for wizards. You can also explore the apartment of Tina and Queenie Goldstein to get a better sense of who those characters are. You don't have to just limit your wizarding to maps either, as if you simply speak "Okay Google" into your android phone, you'll have several options. Saying "Silencio" will mute your phone, while "Lumos" will activate the phone's flashlight. To turn it off, simply say "Nox". If you've already preordered the Google Daydream, you'll have a Fantastic Beasts experience right out of the box. Here you'll be able to explore Newt's magical case with a wand in hand for a surreal and magical experience. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an all-new adventure returning us to the wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling. Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) stars in the central role of wizarding world magizoologist Newt Scamander, under the direction of David Yates, who helmed the last four Harry Potter blockbusters. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them opens in 1926 as Newt Scamander has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures. Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have come and gone without incident...were it not for a No-Maj (American for Muggle) named Jacob, a misplaced magical case, and the escape of some of Newt’s fantastic beasts, which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds.

Will AI soon beat humans in the strategy game?  ( Blizzard ) Advertisement AlphaGo, the artificial intelligence program powered by Google's DeepMind, defeated South Korean world Go champion Lee Sedol convincingly with a 4-1 score earlier in the year. It seems that DeepMind is now moving on to a bigger challenge, going from an ancient board game into a modern strategy video game. StarCraft II As An AI At the ongoing BlizzCon 2016, Blizzard and Google announced a collaboration to open up StarCraft II as an AI and machine learning environment for researchers around the world. StarCraft II is one of the most fiercely competitive video games that is played professionally, and according to the DeepMind team, it will provide an interesting testing environment for research in AI as it "provides a useful bridge to the messiness of the real-world." "The skills required for an agent to progress through the environment and play StarCraft well could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks," said Oriol Vinyals, a research scientist for DeepMind who was once the top-ranked player of the game in Spain. While the complexity of Go is the result of a combination of simple rules, there exists several layers of such complexity in StarCraft II. The game requires players to make a succession of strategic decisions while they farm resources, build structures, create units and engage their opponents in combat. Also, unlike Go where all the information is available to players as they progress in the game, the map of StarCraft II is initially obscured, giving them less information to base their decisions on. As such, playing the strategy game requires both memory and adaptation, along with long-term planning. What To Expect From DeepMind And Blizzard Collaboration According to the DeepMind team, the environment that it will be working on with Blizzard for AI research will be made available to all researchers in the field by next year. The environment will simplify the visuals of StarCraft II to be better received by machine learning systems, with an API that will allow for similar functions to bots in the past which study game data. Blizzard will also be providing replays of StarCraft II matches to give the AI systems data to analyze. Will DeepMind be able to create an AI that can dominate matches against humans in StarCraft II, similar to how AlphaGo performed exceeding well against a world champion? That is the ultimate goal of the project, but the DeepMind team said that such an achievement is still very much in the future. However, it should be noted that AlphaGo's ability to win against a human opponent was developed earlier than expected.

Eden Hazard’s two goals, both scored after trademark solo bursts forward, make him man of the match by a whisker, but Pedro and Diego Costa were equally lethal going forward, while Victor Moses, N’Golo Kanté, Marcos Alonso and Nemanja Matic all deserve a name check for their relentless midfield efforts. As good as Chelsea were, Everton simply didn’t turn up. The game was up after 20 minutes, and Ronald Koeman’s tactical tweaks had no impact, with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku cut out of the game completely. They face Swansea after the international break before tests against Southampton and Manchester United. Chelsea face Middlesbrough (A), Tottenham (H) and Man City (A) next. We’ll have a better idea of their title credentials in a month, but they’re top of the table, with five wins and five clean sheets in a row. They’re 3-1 for the title; would you bet against them?

Apart from getting the highest score for a smartphone on DxOMark, the camera rating website, tech reviewers (including us) have been pouring in rave reviews for the Pixel’s camera. We wanted to take a closer look, and what better time to do a shootout than my vacation in France? I had a Pixel in one pocket and an iPhone 7 Plus in the other. I wanted to approach the shootout as a layperson, without any phone tripods or manual camera apps — only stock software, what an average consumer would use. Related: Google Pixel review I ended up using the Pixel as my main camera throughout my nine days in France, which is a first for me as I usually stick with my DSLR. It was one of the first times that I had a trouble-free experience with an Android smartphone camera, and I was able to quickly grab shots thanks to Google’s ingenious shortcut to launch the camera app — double-tapping the power button. You can then use the volume buttons as the shutter button. The cameras on most Android smartphones have been unreliable in my experience. We’re not denying that cameras from phones like the Nexus 6P and 5X, for example, haven’t offered stellar shots. But there has always been something that made the experience frustrating, whether it’s a delay when launching the camera, long-processing times, or shutter lag. Google’s Pixel fixes all of these problems and more. Panorama by the Pixel. There’s almost zero lag using the Pixel camera. I initially said in my review that the camera took half-a-second to capture photos with HDR+, which was annoying at times, but a software update has made it instantaneous. It still takes about two to three seconds to process these HDR+ photos. HDR+ captures several shots with the short exposure times. The best shot is then used as a base, and the others are then layered over to offer a photograph with less noise and blur — perfect for low-light scenarios. It also helps with high-dynamic range environments by taking multiple photos with the same exposure, so that bright parts of a photo aren’t blown out. Related: We put the new Google Pixel XL smartphone through its paces – so how did it do? Both the Pixel and Pixel XL have the same camera on the rear, with 12.3 megapixels and a large pixel size (1.55 micron pixels) which helps for low-light photography. Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus also has a rear camera with 12.3 megapixels, but it also has a second lens that lets you optically zoom for a closer shot. The second telephoto lens is also used for Portrait mode, which adds a DSLR-like blur around a subject. A close match So what have I learned in my time using the two flagship phones? The iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel have excellent cameras, and declaring a winner isn’t cut and dry. There are times the Pixel offers superior photos, but there are plenty of moments where the iPhone comes out on top. Photos from the Pixel often have bluer hues, whereas iPhone images are warmer. The latter also has more realistic photos, but that doesn’t mean the shots are better. A lot of times I prefer the more saturated images on the Pixel, especially in daylight conditions, but your personal preference may vary. Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Here’s a good example showcasing the bluer hues on the Pixel and the warmer colors on the iPhone. Overall, I prefer the Pixel photo for two reasons — there’s more detail when you zoom in, but more importantly the colors pop out and there’s a little more contrast. That makes the picture look more interesting, and I find the iPhone photo to be a little bland and flat, even if it is brighter. Below is a closer look at the same photo. You can see a lot more detail as you look further into the distance, but even in the foreground, the trees on the iPhone 7 Plus look like an oil painting, whereas it’s easier to make out more structures on the Pixel. Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Here are a few more comparisons between the Pixel and the iPhone 7 Plus. You can click on images to enlarge them. iPhone 7 Plus photos were transferred manually from the device to a PC, and the Pixel photos were downloaded from Google Photos — they are the full resolution images, thanks to the free storage option from Google for Pixel owners. The photos are likely compressed when uploaded to WordPress, though. All the photos were taken in Auto-HDR mode — it’s the default setting for both cameras. Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Overall, the Pixel photos are a little sharper and are often more saturated. The iPhone’s photos tend to be a little more realistic, but they sometimes look flat and less dynamic. In low-light scenarios, you do need to make sure you hold your Pixel steady, as it doesn’t have optical-image stabilization. The iPhone has the leg up here, as we sometimes had to take an extra photo with the Pixel to make sure it wasn’t blurry. You may end up liking the iPhone 7 Plus photos over the Pixel, which is valid, because the answer to which photo is better is purely subjective. Both phones take excellent photos and they won’t disappoint in real-world performance with shutter lag or any other issues. Oversaturation The over-saturation on the Pixel can be problematic at times. Take a look at the images below: Pixel iPhone 7 Plus Here’s one scenario where the Pixel went overboard. The iPhone photo retains more detail and is pleasing to the eye — like a still from a movie. The Pixel’s photo has too many colors blown up, which is distracting. There were a handful of moments, particularly in low-light environments, where I would have preferred the Pixel to crank the saturation down. Hopefully, Google can fix the phone’s tendency to oversaturate in low-light via a software update. Lens Blur Unfortunately, I don’t have many photos taken with the iPhone 7 Plus’ Portrait mode to compare it with Google’s Lens Blur. Still, from my experience using both over the past few weeks, I believe Apple’s implementation is consistently accurate and tends to look better than Google’s. Related: Does the Google Pixel really have the best smartphone camera? Judge for yourself Lens Blur still is a great way to place emphasis on a subject, like portraits. Once you select the mode, after you capture a photo the app will prompt you to raise your camera up. The photo will then take a few seconds to process, but you’ll then end up with something like this: Pixel The effect on this photo is pretty good, but you can see there’s not enough blur on the left side where the older woman is behind the primary subject. Here’s the same scenario without Lens Blur: Pixel I do prefer the Lens Blur variant of this photo, but there’s room for improvement in that shot. Here are a few more comparisons: Pixel Pixel with Lens Blur Pixel Pixel with Lens Blur The Lens Blur on the photo with the hourglass set is great, but the first photo doesn’t blur out a part of the woman in the yellow jacket. It’s this type of inconsistency that makes the iPhone 7 Plus’ Portrait mode superior. More often than not, though, as long as you have a clear subject and a fairly clutterless background, the effect should work perfectly. You can also use the refocus tool to fix the photo, but I never end up making much use of this — it’s usually better to retake the shot if possible. With Lens Blur, moving the phone up isn’t always reliable or comfortable. It often made errors, saying I moved too fast or that there was just an “error.” It also often doesn’t work in low-light scenarios most of the time — and all of that makes it unreliable. The iPhone’s Portrait mode does have its kinks — like how you need to make sure you’re a specific distance from the subject — but it’s much faster and consistent. It’s also better because it uses a blend of hardware and software to get the job done. The standard camera takes a photo, and then the second wide-angle sensor measures multiple layers to sense the depth-of-field and see how far the subject is. It’s why you can see the blur effect before you even snap a picture. You end up with a fairly sharp subject and a blurry background. Portrait mode only works on the iPhone 7 Plus, but Lens Blur can work on any device that can install the Google Camera app, notably Pixel and Nexus smartphones. Zoom Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus has one feature that the Pixel doesn’t have: 2x optical hardware zoom. The iPhone also has digital zoom up to 10x, but the picture quality will decrease after you leave the 2x hardware zoom behind. iPhone 7 Plus This is a nice photo. Perhaps a little overexposed on the mountains, but it’s pretty good overall. This was taken with the iPhone 7 Plus. Now let’s zoom in with the second lens on Apple’s smartphone. iPhone 7 Plus with zoom This is an even better photo, and it’s thanks to the iPhone’s second “telephoto” lens. The mountains aren’t as sharp when you zoom in, but it’s still a phenomenal job for a phone camera. The Pixel doesn’t offer anything similar. It features digital zoom, like most smartphone cameras, and it’s something you don’t really want to use as your merely cropping the picture. You’ll still be able to frame some decent photos with the Pixel camera’s zoom, but it’s not going to look as good as the iPhone’s optical zoom. Here’s an example. Pixel zoomed in. Details aren’t sharp at all, and the grain in the photo is easily noticeable. There’s just no competing with the iPhone 7 Plus’ second camera until Google adds some form of optical zoom into next year’s Pixel smartphone. Winner: Google Pixel The real highlight here is the ease of use and the reliability of the Pixel camera. The speed at which I can open it and take a photo is impressive and goes a long way in quickly getting the shot I want. The lack of shutter lag makes me worry less about keeping my hands steady, at least when there’s plenty of light. It’s the same with the iPhone 7 Plus. Both cameras are dead easy to use and take great shots without much effort on your part. Related: The best smartphone camera you can buy The quality of the photos we took with the Pixel are on par — if not better — when compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. Some of the differences between photos taken by both phones are things people will disagree on, but the big takeaway is this: There’s finally an exceptional and reliable camera on a phone that runs stock Android. That’s what’s best about the Pixel. I believe the Pixel’s camera takes more appealing photographs in most cases, but personal tastes will vary. The iPhone 7 Plus has the edge with special features like 2x zoom and a slicker bokeh effect, but the Pixel took better photos on the fly in our tests. The Pixel is the winner for everyday photography. You can read our full Pixel and iPhone 7 Plus reviews here.

No, really A cardboard desk? I won’t stand for it (actually I will) More like this Home Personal Tech Google makes it to third base with Home digital assistant A worthy challenger to the Echo, but no home run 5 Nov 2016 at 14:32, Kieren McCarthy Kieren McCarthy Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Security , Iana, Icann, Fcc, Google Recent Articles The hated Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal will soon be dead. Yay? Tech Trump: Silicon Valley steps into the valley of unhappiness GoPro drone moan brings more bad Karma Review There's really no way to write about Google Home, the search giant's digital assistant, without comparing it to the Amazon Echo. In fact, without the Echo's unexpected and extraordinary success, it's hard to imagine the Home would exist at all. So let's get it out of the way: the Echo just narrowly nudges the Google Home right now. But not by much, and Google's effort is actually better in some respects. It is also easy to see how the Echo's advantages may fall off over time. In short, Google has given the Echo a run for its money right out of the box. But let's step back briefly. What are we talking about really? Even though there has been a lot of excitement about the Echo, it has still not become a ubiquitous technology. There are those completely opposed to the idea of a box in your home listening out for voice commands and reacting accordingly by doing things like playing music, setting timers, providing useful snippets of information, even connecting to smart-home devices and turning on lights or turning up the heat. If you are one of those people, there is nothing about the Google Home that will change your mind; you are better off clicking out of this article right now and finding something else to do with the next five minutes. Then there are those who have an Echo but are intrigued to know what Google has brought to the game. And the answer is: competition. We can expect to see continued and rapid improvements in this area thanks to Google's arrival. That's good for customers of both products. Ecosystem But what you really want to know is: should I buy more Amazon Echos (or the mini-Echo called Dot) for my house? Or think about shifting to Google? And the answer is to wait. Why? Because what will end up differentiating the two will be the alliances and interactions they achieve with other manufacturers. As just one example: you can ask Google's Home to play music on a system in a different room – but currently only through Google's Chromecast streaming device. You can't do that at all with the Echo – but Amazon and Sonos have announced that next year you will be able to. Will Google also work with Sonos? Who knows? Will Amazon work with Chromecast? Possibly, but probably not. Do you already have a speaker system you want to use or are you thinking about buying one? The same approach – and uncertainty – can be applied to the whole range of other things that these digital assistants hope to connect to and which prove to be their real worth. The ecosystem is going to be the ultimate determinant of market leadership. That said, it's worth reflecting on the fact that Google Home has drawn so close to the Echo out the box. Amazon's black cylinder does has an advantage currently, but it is not light years ahead. Newbies And then the final group of people is those pondering whether to buy a digital assistant, possibly for the holidays. And to them, the interesting answer is: go ahead. Do it. The technology is mature enough to warrant it. There are bugs in Google Home, however. For example, it seems to have trouble working properly with music service Pandora. Several times it simply stopped playing songs after one or two songs. Sometimes it says it is going to play a radio station... and nothing happens. This is, obviously, rather frustrating. Also, just like the Echo in the early days, Google Home often struggles with requests and gives a stock answer like "sorry, I don't know how to help with that." Those struggles are fewer than when the Echo launched, but the Echo does have the edge here – mostly thanks to tens of thousands of customers using it now for well over a year. The Echo can handle many more variations of the same question. That said, the Home shows real promise here: when you hit on the "right" question, Google's response is often as good, if not better, than Amazon's. So long as Google is planning to learn from Home usage (rather than continue to rely mostly on its existing huge search database), it is easy to see how it could surpass the Echo. Some quick and dirty examples. Ask the Home what sounds a pig makes and it will play a clip of a pig snorting. Ask the Echo/Alexa and it tells you it has added a link in its app. Ask Home what is Spanish for 'sandwich' and it will joyfully tell you – complete with mild accent 'emparedado.' Ask Alexa and it says "I'm sorry I can't pronounce that, I have written it down" and it sends you to the app again. Duel That said, when asked how Alexander Hamilton died, the Echo gave a useful and relatively detailed rundown, whereas Home simply stated it was "by duel." The two devices were on a par when it came to a wide range of other requests: from shop closing times to setting timers to turning smart home equipment on and off (although we note that only the Echo works with the Ecobee smart thermostat; both work with Nest). Both also worked passably well with personal calendars. And both provide useful weather and news updates, seemingly from the same sources. Oh, and setup for both is easy. Where Google has fallen down is in not meeting the hype that it itself developed. When it launched last month, Google painted a picture of vastly superior intelligence and analysis: you would ask it questions and set up complex interactions and it would handle it easily. There is little evidence that that level of complexity exists right now beyond carefully choreographed demonstrations. For example, I asked Google Home to play the latest episode of the BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Amazingly, it figured this request out without needing any further input and started playing the latest episode. But then when I followed up with "no, not this episode, can you play the Desert Island Discs with Harry Rabinowitz," it drew a total blank. The intelligence is only going down one level. So those are the software and ecosystem capabilities. What will be a key decider for many people looking at the devices will be things inherent to the device itself. Here again there is a split and it will fall to individual taste. Cost: The Home is $50 cheaper than the Echo and costs $130. This might be a decider for some but let's be honest, these devices are not essentials so we suspect the price differential is less a factor than everything else. Look: The Home is shorter and a little stubbier. It is white and has changeable color bases. The Echo is a taller, thinner, black cylinder. Getting personal, both this reviewer and, critically, his wife, prefer the Home in this regard. Sound: Again, it's a personal thing. The Echo has slightly better speakers (tested by cranking them up to max) but the Home has a warmer quality to it which makes music more pleasurable. That said, the spoken word is a little cleaner and crisper on the Echo, so radio sounds a little better. Mic: The microphones are critical with this device, for obvious reasons. The two edge cases are when there is a lot of residual noise in the room when you ask the device to do something, and when you are in another room shouting out a command in the hope it will be heard and acted on. In both cases, the Echo performed better. But not so much that it was a problem for the Home. Wake word: You wake up the Echo by using the wake-word "Alexa." This provides a pleasant, personable feel to the device which is nice. The Home, however, is woken by saying "OK, Google" or "Hey Google." Frankly, for this reviewer, constantly saying "OK, Google" feels a little uncomfortable and constantly reminds you of the company rather than feeling like a personal assistant. It feels impersonal. This may seem like a small thing, but when you have to say it every time, having a person's name to say feels much less like an imposition. This single factor alone may give the Echo the edge in usage. In short, Google Home has done amazingly well right out the gates. It trails the Amazon Echo, but only slightly, and it has the potential to steam ahead, at least in terms of intelligence of answers, as the system gets much wider general use by the public. This reviewer prefers the Home on a device level but not enough to be evangelical about it, and can easily see why others may prefer the Echo. The big decider will be in the next 6-12 months when it becomes clear how much each company can persuade other manufacturers to work with its system. Amazon is clearly out ahead in this respect, but can Google catch up or will it go the Apple route and decide that the best solution for everyone will be to buy lots of interoperable Google products? Only time will tell. In the meantime, I have left both devices in the kitchen of the family home to see which one gets more attention. The Google Home is available now, in the US, for $129. The Amazon Echo is $180. We'll let you know when Google makes it available in the UK. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 66 Comments More from The Register Home Office extends mega 18-year Fujitsu contract So much for breaking up the SIs then 3 Comments It's finally happened: Hackers are coming for home routers en masse SoHopeless 55 Comments User group spawns home lab how-to community Open Homelab Project promises to help you build the test rig your boss won't fund 2 Comments Home Office staff: Over 100 of our work mobiles lost or pinched last year Where did you say you'd run those mega-database apps again? 12 Comments Blighty's Home Office database blunders will deprive hundreds of GB driving licences Independent report slams officials' cock-ups 50 Comments Feds collar chap who allegedly sneaked home US hacking blueprints Bloke, 51, worked at Snowden's old haunt Booz Allen 17 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

One of these tests was a series of search shortcuts that had a very distinct circle design in the Google Now (now known as Feed) page right below the search bar. That interface didn’t spread to a wider user base, but it appears that Google is still toying with the idea, albeit in a different look.

Android is always leading the mobile applications market for all the industries. Android app development companies are highly supported by Google through the features it provides. Nougat is all about improving pre-existing features, extended functionality and expanding the stock of android. The little surprises packed with the O.S are attractive enough to make any user fall in love with it. The latest features introduced works in improving upon the overall Android experience. Let's take a look at what's new in the OS introduced by Google: Split screen Use two apps at a time. Google has added multi-window support for all android devices running android 7.0. To activate multi-window mode, long press the recent apps button while in an app. The android app you are currently using will go on the top of the screen with a list of recently used apps visible along the bottom. The user can choose the second app to use from the list. Notification prioritization The user can tell android about the notification information to be displayed on the lock screen within the notification area of the setting. Long pressing a notification can give to access its priority settings or swiping it a little to the side and tapping the gear icon to access the options. Multiple notifications from the same app will not get bundled up together saving more space and allowing dismissing or expanding for individual attention. This feature will be useful in managing various android apps. Quick settings A list of five toggles that is always present at the top of the notification shade. The small arrow on the right side will take the user to the full setting page. The user can also rearrange the tiles or even replacement of the tiles with others by simply tapping the edit button at the bottom right. Long pressing a tile will take the user to its full setting menu screen. Improved DOZE OFF functionality The new version of Doze works after your screen has been off for a certain period of time. Earlier the Doze function works only when the device is stationary completely which is difficult as sitting at one place with our device in our pocket can move a lot by a simple movement of your legs. But in nougat, the Doze feature works even when the device is not stationary. Easy reply to messages The user can reply to messages from apps like facebook messenger, hangouts or in-built messenger from the notification bar directly. No need to bounce between multiple android apps to continue a conversation. The reply to messages can be done simply by taping the reply button or user can use the reply options suggested. Android app development is now more versatile and the companies developing android applications should keep in mind the latest features while creating an android application.

Home News Operating Systems Google introduced Android nine years ago today Today, Android is the most popular operating system by far, which isn't surprising since so many phone manufacturers use it for their devices By: Lana Jelic | Operating Systems News | Posted: 1 week, 2 days ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA A recent report showed that Android phones hold 88% of the market. Global shipments hit 375 million units in the third quarter of 2016, and 328.6 million of them were Android phones.     The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream, released on October 22th, 2008. However, the history of Android OS started much earlier.   The Android OS was initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005 for at least $50 million. Not much was known about Android Inc. at the time, but many assumed that Google was planning to enter the mobile phone market with this move.   Speculations continued through 2006, and Google worked on a prototype codenamed Sooner that initially had no touchscreen, but instead featured a physical keyboard. They later re-designed it to compete with other announced devices such as LG Prada and Apple iPhone. However, Google didn't introduce its own devices until 2010 when they launched the Nexus series of smartphones and tablets.   But the move to buy Android Inc. paid off, and in 2007 they introduced the Android OS.   On November 5, 9 years ago, the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of technology companies including Google, device manufacturers such as HTC, Sony and Samsung, wireless carriers such as Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile, and chipset makers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, unveiled itself, with a goal to develop open standards for mobile devices. That day, Android was unveiled as its first product, a mobile device platform built on the Linux kernel.   Today, Android is the most popular operating system by far, which isn't surprising since so many phone manufacturers use it for their devices. Android has become a dominant force in global application development as well and has sparked countless innovation in both hardware and software over these years since its release.

ChromeBook Review Chromebook vs. Laptop – Which is Right For You? Chris Stobing Updated November 11, 2016 Shares Can't decide on a Chromebook or laptop? Read our guide to find out which is right for you. Chromebooks vs. Laptops. It’s a battle that’s been raging for nearly five years now, with plenty of good points being made by those on both sides of the argument. But which portable computer is right for you, and which might hold you back? Read on to find out. Chromebook vs Laptop   Chromebook Laptop Operating System Chrome OS Linux, Windows, OS X 3rd Party Apps Allowed Highly Averse to Malware and Viruses WiFi Expandable Memory Expandable Storage Price Range Low to Medium Medium to High Operating Systems The Chrome OS is limited to Android like apps, which means 3rd party ones aren’t allowed. The three main competing laptop operating systems include OS X on Macbooks, Windows 10 on third-party laptops (Toshiba, Asus, Microsoft, etc), and Linux. Chrome OS, or in this case Chromebooks, which entered the fray not too long ago and is similar to that of Android, certainly isn’t for everyone.  However, it still serves its (limited) purpose pretty well across the board. I’ve personally used a Chromebook for two years as my road laptop, and not once has the OS ever crashed on me. There might be an occasional stutter during a 1080p video on YouTube, but otherwise the lean, mean design of the Chrome OS prevents it from experiencing any significant hangups. Windows is the exact opposite of this, of course. By this point the word “Windows” has basically become synonymous with “pulling your hair out”, and although OS X enjoyed a few years of flawless bliss when Macbooks were gaining in popularity, its reliability has since dropped quite a bit. That said, one of the main reasons both OS X and Windows have problems at all is because they support third-party software and applications, while Chrome OS does not. Last there’s Linux. Technically there are ways you can install a custom Linux build on a Chromebook, so if you’re not totally sold on Chrome OS but still want a new laptop for not a lot of money, check out this guide on which models can support the operating system swap.

The fact is Chrome OS is an extremely closed off ecosystem, one which only allows you to perform a few select functions and not much else. Google keeps their operating system secure by restricting what can be “installed” on a Chromebook, if you could even call it that. Almost all of the apps you “install” on your machine don’t actually run locally. Instead Chrome places an icon in your start menu, which is only a link to a website that supports the “program” in Flash or HTML5. The only true apps installed on the machine are the Chrome web browser, as well as offline versions of Docs, Sheets, and Google’s PowerPoint competitor, Slides. Macbooks and PCs on the other hand are made to be customized, and come with the option to install literally hundreds of thousands of different programs and types of software at once. If you need something that can run Photoshop, play your favorite games, or even run an .FLV video file, then a Windows laptop or Macbook will be the de facto choice. CPU and RAM Currently, all Chromebooks ship with Intel processors. Due to a deal inked between Google and Intel, almost all the Chromebooks released last year (and coming in 2016) are equipped with Intel processors. For the AMD faithful this may be an issue, but for most, the Intel mobile line and 5th-generation Core processors can handle Chrome OS just fine. It’s difficult to make a direct comparison of the amount of “power” you get from a Chromebook compared to a standard Windows laptop or Apple Macbook, largely because each one comes with an OS that uses its resources differently. Chrome OS is light, so it runs well on worse (less powerful) hardware.  So the comparison is a moot one. If you were to install Windows on a laptop that had identical specs it would run slower, simply for the fact that Windows has tons of extraneous processes and tasks it runs in the background while nothing else is going on. In short, Windows requires more horsepower to run, much like a big truck requires a larger engine over a smaller car. Storage One area where Chromebooks still need to catch up is with onboard storage. Because they’re made to be cheap and light, almost all Chromebooks come with an SSD opposed to a standard HDD, which ups the cost of manufacturing. As such, it’s rare to find any model of Chromebook with more than 32GB of available onboard storage. To compensate, most Chromebooks will come with 100GB of free cloud storage, provided by Google’s own Drive service. If the idea of keeping all your data on the cloud doesn’t sound like your cup of tea however, it might be better to simply go with a standard laptop instead. Laptops on the other hand come in pretty much any storage configuration you can think of. Want your operating system on an SSD and your games/movies on an HDD backup? There’s a laptop for that. Don’t mind long loading times and just want as much space as possible? There’s a 3TB hard drive just for you.  Screen The Toshiba Chromebook 2 offers an excellent screen for a Chromebook. In the pursuit of making these laptops as affordable as possible, sometimes sacrifices need to be made. Screen quality is an area where almost all Chromebooks lag woefully behind the 1366 x 768 curve, and it’s expected that unless it’s a model that specifically touts its HD-capability, you probably won’t be showing it off to your co-workers anytime soon. There are some exceptions to the rule, of course. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 was our number #1 pick of the lot for the best Chromebook 2016, a title it won in large part thanks to its absolutely 1920 x 1080 HD IPS screen. If you plan on watching a lot of Netflix or working with color-senstive creative materials online, this model is one of very few that would be able to handle it. On the laptop side of things – it’s a bit all over the place. Some laptops sport stunning 4K screens that can play Blu-Ray content at its absolute peak, while others are so grainy you can barely read a paragraph of text on them without having to adjust your glasses twice. Where touchscreens are concerned, while Windows does maintain the advantage on the sheer number of touchscreen laptops available, many of them are sub-par in quality.  Comparatively, the  ASUS Flip Chromebook made our top Chromebooks of 2016 list both for it’s solid design, and a touchscreen that responds to even the slightest graze of your finger. Keyboard and Trackpad While some Chromebooks are built as cheap as possible and come with keyboards or trackpads to match (looking at you, HP), others, like the Toshiba Chromebook 2, are an absolute dream to type on. Because Chromebooks are made as machines that can help you with work, school, or generally getting a lot of typing done, most of the keyboards on a Chromebook will do the job with flying colors. The trackpads on the other hand are a bit hit or miss. Cost-compared against Windows machines, you’re going to get a similar deal in quality. If you opt for a Macbook however, the trackpad will clearly be superior due to the increased price and money spent on the overall quality of the surrounding hardware. Webcam This one is a bit of an even draw. Chromebooks may come with some cheap components, but Google knows that of all the features that people want on a laptop, the webcam should be up to par. Comparing webcams from several of the top Chromebooks on the market right now against what you’d get in a Windows laptop or Macbook five times the cost, it’s clear that any Chromebook worth its salt will have a webcam that works in most lighting situations, even if you still can’t use it to call someone over Skype. Price Categorically, for the specs you get and the ease of use you should expect out of a device, price is where Chromebooks truly shine. Because Google doesn’t charge third-party companies for use of their OS, manufacturers can use the resources that would have otherwise been spent licensing the operating system on better specs. This means that on a direct 1:1 cost comparison, the hardware you get inside a Chromebook will always edge out what you might find in a competing Windows PC. As for Chromebooks vs. Macbooks; it’s not even a contest. Apple marks up their products by the handful compared to Google. And while a baseline 2015 Macbook Air will run you upwards of $999 at the checkout counter, a comparable Chromebook with the same specs would be nearly three times less, at $330. Read: Best Ultrabook 2016 The whole draw of Chromebooks is that they offer solid hardware at half the cost of what you’d spend on any other laptop. Although they may not have much software to speak of and their onboard storage capacities border on pitiful, you’re getting a fully-functional laptop at a discount so steep it would put lesser companies straight out of business. Which is Right for You, Chromebook or Laptop? In the war between Chromebooks vs. laptops – it looks like the winner comes down to personal preference. The only way you’ll really be able to decide if a Chromebook is right for you (or any members of your family), is to know what you’re going to use it for the most ahead of time. If you only need a machine that goes online, opens web pages, and lets you type to your heart’s content, a Chromebook is the perfect pick. If you think you might need more flexibility down the line however, it might be better to spend your cash on a Windows laptop or Macbook instead. Chrome OS is great for your kid’s first laptop or as a backup while you’re punching out the yearly expense report from an airport terminal.  But it lags behind when it comes to supporting most types of media playback, running third-party software, or gaming on the go. They’re cheap, they’re light, but they also don’t do a whole lot. If that sounds like the perfect marriage of just enough features at just a low enough price, then a Chromebook might be right for you.

The study was based on primary research conducted on close to 3,000 consumers across 16 cities. Flipkart grabbed the third position in the Internet category, jumping 221 slots to 125th rank across India, while Snapdeal saw an improvement of 63 ranks to 302nd on the list. Social networking giant Facebook rose 202 ranks in the national rankings to 157th position in 2016, and was placed fourth in the category, the study said. "The Internet category has seen a surprising shift in the top ranks, with Amazon ranking higher than Google, implying a serious improvement in the appeal of conducting transactions online," TRA Chief Executive Officer N Chandramouli said. Flipkart CEO’s response to Amazon’s No.1 claim Flipkart CEO Binny Bansal said the company's sales (or gross merchandize value of items sold on the platform) during the festive season was 70-80% higher than that of Amazon's and that it accomplished this at a third of the costs borne by the latter. ​ This is apparent from the fact that out of the 29 brands listed in the Internet category in 2016, 11 brands were online retailers, he added. "Expected brands like Shopclues (461 rank) and Uber (483) were listed in the internet category along with some surprising entrants like Koovs (477), Voonik (937) and Oyo Rooms (948)," he said. The list was topped by Korean electronics giant LG while the Tata conglomerate slipped in ranking to the seventh spot this year (from 5 in 2014 and 4 in 2015). Other Internet brands in the tally included WhatsApp (339), Paytm (341), Myntra (397), Youtube (500), Twitter (506), Ola (605) and JustDial (786).

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Amazon Echo And Google Home Set To Battle For Holiday Dominance Posted: Nov 5 2016, 4:00am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 7 2016, 3:33am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The contender to Amazon's digital assistant home device has arrived. The fight is on this Holidays. Who will win? Amazon stood up Google and Apple with the release of Amazon Echo two years ago. That is right. While Google was still playing with sandbox toys, Amazon has shipped a device that can answer all your questions you ask out loud in your home. For two years there was nothing comparable. Now Google finally ships the Google Home device, a direct competitor to the Amazon Echo. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals Update: Amazon launched on November 7 an Amazon Echo deal with the lowest price in the history to celebrate the 2nd birthday of the Amazon Echo. The Amozon Echo sells for $140.39 for a limited time. Google Home comes out of the gate with a $50 lower price. Google Home sells for $129 at Walmart, Target and Best Buy. These retailers make a big deal out of the Google Home launch and feature the product prominently in their stores. Google is set to go full in with the Google Home this Holiday season and attack Amazon's market share with the Echo.  The Amazon Echo had a two year head start and Amazon used this time to get a long list of developers behind the Alexa platform. There are more than hundred Amazon Echo Skills that enable the device to play music, order food and control your home. Google Home is behind, but also offers a developer platform that will quickly add these skills. So which home assistant is better? You can't go wrong with either one. A side to side test asking questions to Echo and Home on Digital Trends shows that Google Home is a bit better in answering knowledge questions. Amazon needs to be careful not to get behind in that field. For instance Alexa fails to answer the question what koalas eat. The Amazon Echo sold for $149 on Prime Day earlier this year and in the Black Friday sale last year. Amazon is in full control of the pricing of the Amazon Echo and it will be clear that the Amazon Black Friday 2016 deal will be at least as low as $129 to match Google Home. We could even imagine that Amazon goes in the offensive and prices the Amazon Echo for under $100. Amazon has its e-commerce eco system behind the Amazon Echo. Google does not have that advantage. For Amazon, the Echo is just another way to get people to shop on Amazon.com. Amazon Prime members can use their voice to order anything on Amazon.com just by asking Alexa on their Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, Amazon Fire TV, or Fire tablet. Amazon will even have hundreds of exclusive deals just for voice shoppers this holiday season listed at www.amazon.com/alexadeals. You can have Alexa tell you her deals by just asking: "Alexa, what are your deals?" Jeff Bezos' Amazon imperium will not let Google to easily waltz in between them and shoppers. There are no rumors yet about Amazon releasing a new Amazon Echo 2. A new Echo that leaps Google Home in performance and specifications would be the best weapon, but it is not clear what new hardware features would be improving the user experience. The Amazon Echo comes in white and black and is available on amazon.com and at Best Buy.

Google Glass was derided in the press as a dorky, clunky, privacy-invading error. (In truth, it was a bold experiment that launched the smart glasses revolution.) Google Glass proved that conspicuous wearables don't belong on your face. The camera made people nervous. The screen caused a malady I called "Glass eye" (pain from having one eye exposed to bright light in a dark room). Looking at the Google Glass screen created awkward social situations when users looked up and to the right to see the screen. Battery life was terrible. All these problems were caused by the visual elements of Google Glass -- the camera and screen prism. But what if someone came out with smart glasses without optics? Good news: smart glasses with no camera or screen are coming on the market. The great thing about these glasses isn't the lack of cameras and screens. It's that they can pass as totally normal, everyday prescription glasses or sunglasses (or both). I call this category "invisible smart glasses," because the wearable computing elements are invisible. This ability to pass as normal glasses is, to me, the ultimate feature. Most people won't accept conspicuous electronics on their faces. I believe that invisible smart glasses will soon surpass smart watches and all other wearables. Eventually, they'll surpass even dumb glasses. Here's why all glasses should be invisible smart glasses. Vue The best "invisible smart glasses" I've seen so far are called Vue smart glasses. They're being crowdfunded on Kickstarter. I sat down this week with two members of the four-person Vue team: co-founder Tiantian Zhang and product marketing manager, Aaron Rowley, at their incubator office in San Francisco. I also got to check out Vue prototypes. Vue glasses look almost exactly like ordinary prescription glasses or sunglasses. No bulky electronics. No strange visible screens or lights. And at 28 grams (0.9 ounces), they're light. Vue glasses will come in two styles ("Classic" and "Trendy"), three colors (black, white and brown) plus five options for the temples (black, "carbon fiber," "wood," brown and blue) and three lens types (prescription, sunglasses and "fashion" -- where you just wear glasses for the look). All the "smart" interface elements are hidden. Sure, if you look carefully at the earpiece or curve of the temple (the part of the glasses that hook around your ears), they do look fat. Unlike Google Glass, which are fat on one side and basically wire thin on the other, both Vue temples are the same size, with the bulk of the electronics on one side and the battery on the other. Vue smart glasses have bone-conduction pads on both sides (Google Glass needed optional earbuds because the design allowed bone conduction on one side only), a tiny LED light on the inside of the temple near the frame on the right side and a tiny microphone embedded in the right temple. A touch screen graces the outside of the temple on the right side -- but they don't look like they're touch controls. The flashing light alerts you to incoming messages and emails, and you can choose what the blinking means in the settings section of the app. The LED light is positioned to get your attention, but to be invisible to others. The bone conduction pads let you hear any sound you might normally hear through earbuds, including Siri or Google Assistant, phone calls, alerts, audio feedback, music, podcasts and so on. (Vue claims patent-pending technology that prevents others from hearing anything from the bone-conduction speakers.) The best thing about bone conduction is that you get sound without anything entering or covering your ears. So you can have access to the audio cues all day without the discomfort of wearing earbuds. And if you do need to listen to music or take a longer call, your ears are free and you can do so without removing the glasses. (Note that bone conduction technology is not an acceptable replacement for earbuds when it comes to music. It's fine for notifications and even short phone calls. But the audio quality is nowhere near even cheap earbuds or headphones.) The touch screen on the outside of the right temple offers four gestures, which users can customize: single tap, double tap, swipe and long press. For example, you could use the single tap gesture to answer a call and the swipe gesture to go to the next email. Vue is building an online tool for choosing the right prescription lenses, and is working with an FDA-approved lens maker to handle prescription lenses, according to Rowley. An accompanying app will run on iOS and Android, and will provide a range of features and options. For example, you can track your glasses if you lose them, monitor your steps, and get estimates of distance traveled and calories burned. You can charge Vue glasses by inserting them into the included charger case. Like Apple's AirPods, the Vue glasses' case includes its own battery, so you can charge the glasses on the go without plugging into an outlet. Vue claims up to three days of standby time with the glasses themselves, and up to seven days of standby battery life when you combine the total charge of the glasses and case. Crowdfunding is one way to gauge demand. Vue's Kickstarter campaign launched less than two weeks ago, and has raised more than $370,000. Kickstarter backers can get Vue glasses for $179, and the company expects to ship in July. The full retail price is expected to be $269.99. (You can hear my full, candid conversation with Zhang and Rowley by subscribing to my podcast, The FATcast.) Why invisible smart glasses are the perfect wearable Vue glasses represent an emerging category of invisible smart glasses that make the gadgetry invisible by abandoning optics -- no cameras, no screens. Other contenders in this space include Zungle Panther sunglasses and VSP Level glasses. Eventually, we'll have the technology to make invisible smart glasses that do have optics. I wrote in January about Carl Zeiss's smart glass technology, which achieves invisibility using something called a fresnel lens. Laforge Optical is already offering for pre-order a $590 pair of smart glasses called Shima glasses, which do offer a heads-up display but achieve near invisibility by reflecting a temple-embedded screen into the right eye via a "series of optical elements in the lens." (I wouldn't advise pre-ordering new technology like this without seeing and trying them first.) Optics, not optics -- whatever. The crucial feature is "invisibility" of the electronics. The future of smart glasses will be dominated by wearables that pass as ordinary, everyday glasses. I believe the so-called "killer app" for invisible smart glasses is artificially intelligent virtual assistants -- the coming-soon revolution I wrote about here recently. Consumers are falling in love with their Amazon Echos and Google Homes. These virtual assistant appliances thrill because you don't have to pull out your phone and find and launch an app. You just talk. And the appliances talk back. Once people have these in their homes, they want them in their cars, offices and everywhere. But plugging in "appliances" all over the place is inelegant. True ubiquity (as well as improved fidelity, lower cost and enhanced personalization and privacy) will be enabled by wearing the virtual assistant appliance on your physical person. Hearables are one solution. This new category of wearables that I told you about in this space involves earbuds with wirelessly connected computers built in. Hearables are great, but aren't practical for everyday, all-day use. They're uncomfortable after a few hours, which doesn't matter, because their batteries don't last that long. Invisible smart glasses will prove to be far more practical. With batteries that last longer than a full day, and no uncomfortable "bud" in your ears, they'll be just like wearing the glasses you're already wearing. Unlike Google Glass, hearables or even smart watches, invisible smart glasses are perfectly "sticky." Because they're your glasses, you'll wear them all day, every day, even if the battery is dead. After pondering the promise of invisible smart glasses like Vue glasses, it's clear to me that ordinary glasses that deliver your A.I. virtual assistant are the perfect wearable. They're socially acceptable. They're "sticky." And you're already wearing glasses. Once you see invisible smart glasses, the future of wearable computing comes into focus.

RCS enables a host of enhancements not possible over SMS including high-resolution photo and video sharing, confirmation that a recipient has read your message, group chat and freedom from that annoying 160 character limit. RCS isn’t exactly a new concept (it was conceived in 2007 with the initial release pushed out in 2012) nor are the features it delivers. Roughly a decade ago, the wireless landscape looked nothing like it does today. Wireless carriers, which for years had made their money selling service plans that focused on metered talk minutes, were now marketing unlimited text messaging as their key perk. It wasn’t long before services like BlackBerry Messenger and Apple’s iMessage came along, offering users a way to circumvent carrier texting and rendering SMS-focused service plans useless. As additional third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger emerged over the years, SMS more or less fell by the wayside. As mentioned, RCS has been around for years with several carriers including AT&T and T-Mobile having launched apps based on the technology under various names. What Google is looking to do now, however, is get everyone on the same page by baking support for RCS into the standard Android Messenger app… or at least, that seems to be the goal. As The Verge highlights, Messenger is just one of the three messaging apps that Google ships on its Pixel phones (Allo for consumers, Messenger for carriers and Hangouts for enterprise). Google says that come next year, all new Android devices from Sprint will come with Messenger for Android pre-loaded as the default SMS and RCS messaging experience. Those currently using select LG and Nexus phones from Sprint will have their messaging experience upgraded automatically via app update. Furthermore, those using other Android devices can grab the Messenger app from the Play Store should they so choose. One can’t help but wonder if this unifying tactic is too little, too late. Third-party apps like those mentioned above already have massive user bases and advanced features like end-to-end encryption. As of this past February, for example, WhatsApp said it had more than a billion active monthly users. I’m struggling to see how a carrier messaging app is going to gain much headway in an already crowded and established market but I digress. The search giant said it looks forward to launching RCS with more partners in the coming months.

CNET 05/11/2016 Sean Hollister © Provided by CNET James Martin/CNET On a cloudy day this May, in the dull fluorescent light of a plain white Google conference room, Rafa Camargo, Richard Wooldridge and Blaise Bertrand told CNET their plan to disrupt the phone market. Ara, a Lego-like phone with modular parts, would let buyers snap on a better camera, additional batteries or any other creative hardware a developer might dream up. It was set to be the first phone entirely designed by Google, the three men claimed. Then the Ara project was abruptly shelved. But now, all three of those men work for Building 8 -- a secretive new division of Facebook. There, they've been joined by an impressive list of heavy hitters that reads like a who's who of the tech world: Motorola, Tesla, Apple and Amazon, in addition to that contingent of Google ex-pats. So what, exactly, is this superteam of designers, engineers and manufacturing experts working on? Nobody outside of Menlo Park knows for sure, but the hires -- and at least one under-the-radar acquisition -- seem to indicate two things: it's mobile, and it may be modular. Whatever it turns out to be, building hardware at this scale represents a major shift for Facebook. The company's first attempt at hardware -- a 2013 joint venture with HTC that became known as the " Facebook phone" -- was a fiasco, discounted to 99 cents mere weeks after its debut. Since then, though, the company has doubled down, first with its $2 billion purchase of VR headset maker Oculus in 2014, and now with what appears to be a far more ambitious hardware endeavor with Building 8.  What's Building 8? © Reuters Building 8 isn't an actual building; Facebook's Menlo Park offices are numbered 10 through 20. (Building 20 not pictured.) Originally, it sounded like Building 8 was a skunkworks where Facebook could prototype a whole bunch of new technologies -- like 360-degree video cameras -- and figure out the fastest way to get them into consumers' hands, usually through partnerships. That's what Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer suggested to the The Wall Street Journal, and it's what was widely assumed when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced he'd hired Regina Dugan to lead Building 8. Dugan is the former head of both the US Department of Defense's DARPA research arm, and Google's Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) research lab. Zuckerberg suggested, in an April 2016 blog post, that Building 8 would pursue "augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, connectivity and other important areas" -- which sounds pretty sciencey, to be sure. But the division's job postings and recent hires tell a slightly different story -- beginning with the Building 8 mission statement you'll find at the top of each job post. Here's the mission statement in full: Building 8 brings together world-class experts to develop and ship groundbreaking products at the intersection of hardware, software, and content. We have a clear mandate to ship products at scale. In particular, seemingly impossible products that define new categories that advance Facebook's mission of connecting the world. The B8 team will apply DARPA-style breakthrough development at the intersection of ambitious science and product development. It will operate on aggressive, fixed timelines, with extensive use of partnerships in universities, small and large businesses. Building 8 is all about shipping hardware, it seems. And could "seemingly impossible products" include an ambitious modular phone like Ara? Facebook didn't reply to a request for comment.  Phone experts wanted CNET analyzed nearly 50 Facebook job postings, past and present, and dug through dozens of employee profiles on LinkedIn to see the big picture. It soon became clear: Facebook isn't just building a lab in hopes of spinning out a few new startup companies. Instead, Facebook is hiring over a dozen different heads of what appear to be a dozen distinct departments within Building 8 -- including industrial design, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, device software, applications and services, manufacturing, supply chain and even customer service. Many of those heads of product are being asked to hire their own teams from scratch. In other words, Facebook appears to be building an organization that could conceptualize, design, produce, ship and sell hardware, and even deal with customers after the fact. (Who needs customer service and return policies for prototypes?) Only two of Facebook's new department heads are devoted to "skunkworks" and "partnerships," respectively, and few of the job postings ask for experience across the wide range of disciplines you might expect for a research lab. But many of them ask for people with mobile experience -- Android in particular. For instance, this posting for a lead electrical engineering systems architect specifically asks for experience with mobile processors, antennas and thermal design, and these two for a camera software engineer and a kernel software engineer each require five years of experience working with mobile processors and an "understanding of Android Frameworks." The heads of product software, product engineering and hardware each need experience leading teams that have brought "smart phone (Android, iOS) and/or consumer electronics" to market. There are also strong hints that the new head of software applications and services will be tasked with developing Android apps for the hardware Building 8 will make. Two other jobs specifically mention Facebook's intent to build "compelling consumer-facing products on the Android platform," and yet another hints that Facebook may sell accessories to go along with its products. Key talent According to their LinkedIn profiles, many of Building 8's recent hires reinforce the idea that Facebook is pursuing hardware in a big way: - Nathan Kelly, Building 8's new head of global supply chain, previously helped build supply chains for Sonos, Tesla, HP/Palm, Microsoft and Sony Ericsson, according to his LinkedIn profile. - Rich Heley, the new head of manufacturing, spent a decade at Apple figuring out how to mass produce aluminum enclosures for the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac -- all the way back to the first MacBook Pro -- then spent three years at Tesla, finishing as VP of product technology. - Furhan Zafar previously directed the supply chain for Motorola's Moto Maker -- an effort that let buyers pick different phone backs and different accent colors for their phone's buttons and grills before they shipped to customers. - Tim McCune, Building 8's new head of systems engineering, spent 17 years at Motorola and a brief stint at Apple as well. - Richard Wooldridge, the new COO of Building 8, wasn't just the logistics behind Google's modular Ara handset -- he also spent four years leading the global supply chain at Motorola, including Moto's effort to build a factory in the US for the first Moto X phone. - Rafa Camargo, Building 8's new head of product engineering, led development on Google's Ara phone, after a year and a half at Amazon's Lab126 hardware group working on the Amazon Fire Phone and 13 years at Motorola on such iconic projects as the Droid, Razr, even the StarTAC flip phone. - Viresh Rustagi, the new head of device software at Building 8, was the head of software for Google's Ara as well -- after a two-year-plus stint managing a software dev team for Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets and set-top boxes, and 12 years working on software for mobile processors at Broadcom. - Blaise Bertrand, Facebook's new head of creative, spent three years designing for Motorola and 12 at noted design firm IDEO, in addition to seven months at Google ATAP working on the Ara phone. These high-level execs are just the start. Building 8 has also snapped up a number of former Apple employees, including an executive recruiter, and is currently hiring three other recruiters and a recruiting manager to expand its collection of talent. It's also worth noting that, for now, all of these hardware efforts appear to be separate from the ones inside Facebook proper: the company already had its own VP of hardware and supply chain to help build its data centers and networking infrastructure. Oculus, the Facebook virtual-reality subsidiary, has its own separate hardware team too, plus its own research arm based in Seattle. Will Google's modular phone live on? Even if Facebook just hired four key members of the Google Ara team to lead its manufacturing and supply chain efforts, and even if it has a number of other mobile experts on the payroll, we can't say for sure they'll be working on a phone. All of Facebook's new expertise could go towards anything else that uses mobile processors, radios and the Android OS -- such as headsets, tablets, watches, smart home and other internet-of-things devices. Or something entirely new. And even if it is a phone, it isn't necessarily a modular one. Having failed to convince Google, the team may have given up on that idea. But perhaps not: In September, one month after the Ara team jumped ship, Building 8 bought a hardware startup called Nascent Objects -- which just so happened to be developing a modular consumer electronics platform, too. At the time of the acquisition, Building 8's Dugan implied that Nascent's tech would be used for fast prototyping: "Imagine designing, building and delivering a hardware product in just weeks. Instead of months, or even years," Dugan wrote on her Facebook page. "Together, we hope to create hardware at a speed that's more like software." But perhaps Dugan meant that Nascent's modular tech could help consumers build their own hardware -- the same idea behind the Ara modular phone. Back in May, in that Google conference room, the ambition behind Ara was huge. "We want to create a hardware ecosystem on the scale of the software app ecosystem," said Camargo. Wooldridge promised his team would provide hardware and technical support, and help indie hardware designers get their snap-on modules certified by federal regulatory agencies, so that even a "bedroom student" could add a new feature to their phone. Bertrand explained how fashionable it could be, and how attractive for big brands, to have decorative phone pieces that a user could change on the fly. Now, they're all together again, inside a company that -- unlike Google -- wouldn't be disrupting its own business by competing with existing Android hardware partners. (Facebook is a must-have app on more than a billion people's phones, but the company doesn't make any mobile hardware yet.) Plus, they're leading a division with access to "hundreds of millions of dollars" over the next few years, according to Zuckerberg. The ultimate pivot It's possible that Facebook's hardware ambitions never see the light of day. Consider Apple's secretive Project Titan program, which reportedly staffed up and spent millions on a self-driving car initiative that, so far, has only produced several rounds of layoffs and strategy changes. Reportedly. But it seems, at least, that Facebook is following the same path as its arch-rival, Snapchat. Until a few months ago, Snapchat's social app was its only product. But the company recently rebranded itself as a camera company and surprised the world with Spectacles, a Snapchat-specific hardware product it had developed in secret (after stealthily hiring its own group of wearable tech experts). Facebook has a bigger user base than Snapchat, more money and more hardware experts. If the company unveils its own phone -- or mobile accessory -- in the next year or two, it wouldn't be too surprising.

Try this tool By: Rohit Arora Updated: Saturday, November 5, 2016, 15:33 [IST] Artificial Intelligence and Chat Bots are considered to be the next big thing. These two technologies are supposed to provide support or sometimes control everything around us, be it cars, lights, TVs, mobile apps, services, and other electronic devices. And we are not talking about distant future, it's already happening around us. Big names like Google, Apple, Facebook, etc. are implementing them in their new products, for instance- the latest Google Pixel handsets are backed by AI tool Google Assistant, Apple Siri is already quite popular and Facebook is also using chat bots in its Messenger app. SEE ALSO: Reliance Jio's Quest for Better and Smarter Smartphone Experience: 5 Promising Things to Know The day is not far when everyone will have a personal bot offering its services to manage their entire digital life and make things much easier for them. Having said that, there's a great demand for young minds who can think out of the box and create bots to execute digital tasks seamlessly. This is where Gupshup, a cross-channel bot platform offers its services. SEE ALSO: Here are 5 Tricks To Get Better Google Search Results The company claims that it used by over 30,000 developers building services that process over 4 billion messages per month and over 150 billion cumulative. The platform has recently unveiled two bot building tools to create chatbots on its platform, a 'Flow Bot Builder' and a 'Template Bot Builder' using which even non coders can build chat bots. Let's find out how it works. Create Bots with drag and drop The talking point of the new platform is that it doesn't ask for coding skills. Users can use the simple drag-and-drop tools and pre-selected menus to create bots. Flow Bot Builder As per company, the Flow Bot builder makes the process entirely code free. Using a graphical, easy-to-use, web-based interface, users simply design the conversational flow for the bot. The company has also cited an example, where a business analyst can quickly define the navigation flow with a series of menu choices. Flow Bot Builder makes it simple to create a variety of engaging chat bots, from informative to entertaining, without entering a single line of code. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Template Bot Builder Talking about the Template Bot Builder, the company says that it gives entrepreneurs and small business owners the ability to capitalize on the exponential growth of chatbots using pre-defined templates. These templates are fully customizable to fit their audience and brand. For example, a restaurant owner can use a pre-defined bot template that already has food browsing and ordering functionality coded in it. Serves the need of SMBs and individual coders The new tool combines the company's existing IDE Bot Builder (a tool for technical developers) to cater the needs of everyone from enterprises and small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to individual bot fans across the globe.

An anonymous reader quotes a report from VentureBeat: Google and Blizzard are opening up StarCraft II to anyone who wants to teach artificial intelligence systems how to conduct warfare. Researchers can now use Google's DeepMind A.I. to test various theories for ways that machines can learn to make sense of complicated systems, in this case Blizzard's beloved real-time strategy game. In StarCraft II, players fight against one another by gathering resources to pay for defensive and offensive units. It has a healthy competitive community that is known for having a ludicrously high skill level. But considering that DeepMind A.I. has previously conquered complicated turn-based games like chess and go, a real-time strategy game makes sense as the next frontier. The companies announced the collaboration today at the BlizzCon fan event in Anaheim, California, and Google's DeepMind A.I. division posted a blog about the partnership and why StarCraft II is so ideal for machine-learning research. If you're wondering how much humans will have to teach A.I. about how to play and win at StarCraft, the answer is very little. DeepMind learned to beat the best go players in the world by teaching itself through trial and error. All the researchers had to do was explain how to determine success, and the A.I. can then begin playing games against itself on a loop while always reinforcing any strategies that lead to more success. For StarCraft, that will likely mean asking the A.I. to prioritize how long it survives and/or how much damage it does to the enemy's primary base. Or, maybe, researchers will find that defining success in a more abstract way will lead to better results, discovering the answers to all of this is the entire point of Google and Blizzard teaming up. blizzard games google ← Related Links → A Naked Black Hole Is Screaming Through the Universe Human Go Champion 'Speechless' After 2nd Loss To Machine Submission: Google's DeepMind AI Plans To Take On StarCraft II Blizzard Launches A Professional Sports League For 'Overwatch' Face Electrodes Let You Taste and Chew In Virtual Reality Google's DeepMind AI Plans To Take On StarCraft II More | Reply Login Google's DeepMind AI Plans To Take On StarCraft II Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Armed with that knowledge, it's easy to be systematic and deterministic. Games like Poker and Starcraft hide part of the world state from each player, forcing them to guess at the parts they can't see. That opens up the possibility of one player bluffing - leading the opponent down the wrong decision tree because he's fooled into thinking the part of the world state he can't see is different from what it really is. I don't think this is something an AI can "solve". Certainly one could optimize it, so that it becomes damn good at guessing when a certain player is bluffing or not. But put it up against a different player and all that "learned" experience becomes useless, or even counter-productive. Or even pit it against the same player who's aware he's playing against the AI which beat him last time, and he'll simply do something he would never normally do to throw off the computer. It's a difficult enough problem that in pretty much all commercial computer games with a fog of war feature, the computer is just programmed to cheat by ignoring the fog and seeing everything.

The Nexus carried a stripped-down version of Android with no bloatware or funny skins. It was beloved by developers for its simplicity, for getting code updates promptly, and for being cheap. The Pixel only has one of these features, but Google is going for a slightly different market this time around. There's a new skin applied – although it's very tastefully done – and the updates come just as thick and fast. But the Pixel XL has had a major upgrade in price – $769 for the 32GB version we tested as opposed to $499 for a similarly specced Nexus 6P. That's a fairly massive jump, made in part because Google now wants the Pixel line to be about high-end smartphone buyers, not just developers. But is it worth the price? Feel the curves The Pixel XL is slightly more polished in design and there have been some major improvements on the hardware front. The 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5mm phone has an aluminum body shell, although for some reason the top half of the back is covered with the same Gorilla glass that makes up the screen. It's now a particularly weighty handset at 168g, although with a pricey phone, a cover is always a smart investment and that'll bring the bulk and heaviness up a notch. Two-tone phone back HTC built the handset for Google, and design-wise it's not very inspiring. Like the iPhone 7, HTC went for the rounded corners look but the Pixel XL has none of the smoothness of design that Sir Jony and the Apple crew managed to pull off. Another difference between this and the iPhone 7, and some other Android handsets, is water resistance. The Pixel XL isn't water resistant, so if you're prone to dropping handsets in the toilet (hint, take it out of your breast pocket before flushing) then look around for another model. However, the Pixel XL does have something the iPhone 7 doesn't have – a 3.5mm audio jack built into the top of the device. The power and volume buttons are on the right-hand side, with the SIM card slot on the left, and a USB C slot and twin microphones are built into the base. The 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED 534ppi display is a major selling point for the Pixel. It's clear as a bell, and works very well in bright sunlight and in the evening. It handled gaming and video playback as well as anything else on the market and was clear and sharp for ebooks and other text. The cameras are also rather impressive. The 12mp rear camera produces sharp and clear images, and is excellent in poor light conditions, and the 8mp front-facing camera is better than most – possibly thanks to Google wanting to make its Duo videoconferencing app more usable. In drop testing, the phone handled multiple seven-foot drops onto carpet and a three-foot fall onto a wooden floor (thanks to a curious cat) without a scratch or crack to be seen. Get a good case for this phone and it should last until its hardware is obsolescent. Under the covers In the heart of the Pixel is Qualcomm's super-speedy Snapdragon 821 processor, backed up by 4GB of RAM. This makes the phone one of the most powerful out there and it shows in performance testing. The 3450 mAh battery is the same size as with the Nexus 6P, and Google claims that it's good for 14 hours of internet use and 23 days' standby time. The standby figure seems accurate – the standby mode is excellent, but 14 hours of internet seems optimistic; we barely got 12 hours of hard use out of the device. Google also says that users can get seven hours of battery use from just 15 minutes due to fast charging. This also seems optimistic. In recharging tests it took around 35 minutes to get half of the battery charged and 15 minutes was only long enough to get it a third full. It might be a function of the fast charging system, but getting the phone to a full charge took a comparatively long time. The minimum time we got to hit 100 per cent was 111 minutes, because once you get past 90 per cent, charging rates tail off drastically. On the storage front, the Pixel we tested came with 32GB available and upping that to 128GB will cost an extra $100. 32GB seems a little stingy when the phone costs this much, particularly as there's no SD card slot, but the thinking at Google is that cloud storage is the way forward and gives Pixel owners unlimited photo storage. Inside the handset there are the usual grab bag of sensors, but Google has done some sterling work in making these even more useful. The image stabilization features on the camera for video in particular are very good indeed. NFC is built in for use with Android Pay and other apps, but once again Google has decided not to include wireless charging for the device. While there's still a standards war going on in the wireless power sector, it's all over bar the shouting and it wouldn't have added that much to the cost or thickness of the phone. Google also gets brownie points for including a plethora of USB cables in the box. Switching to the new omnidirectional USB plug makes all your old chargers redundant, and getting reliable replacements can be tricky, or even dangerous. So the Pixel ships with the standard Type C charger, but also a Type A to Type C cable running USB 3.0 and a Type C to Type C cable. There's also a Type C to Type C converter. It's a very generous package and one that would have been very useful if the Nexus 5X and 6P had had similar support. Software snippets Google has made a big deal about how the Pixel is the first phone with its software Assistant built in. Activating the Assistant is easy enough – simply say "OK Google" or hold the Home button and then ask a question like "what's the weather like today?" and it'll do its best to answer you. Think of it like a slightly enhanced version of the standard Google search. It's not a bad bit of code, but it's hardly a massive selling point. Siri is slightly dumber, but not by much, and standard searching can do nearly as good a job. It also needs the phone to have full access privileges for your account and if you don't want to overshare with the Chocolate Factory, then it won't work. A much better piece of software for the phone is Duo, Google's videoconferencing app. The cutest feature of this code is that when someone calls you on Duo you get to see video of them before deciding whether to pick up the call, which is very handy. Android's latest skin looks rather spiffy The big worry before getting the phone was the Android 7.1 operating system. On Nexus handsets this was as barebones as you could get, but Google said that with the Pixel it will add its own touches. As it turns out, the skin is very good and takes away nothing from the phone. By the end of a week's use I actually preferred it to the Nexus interface. The verdict As a dedicated Nexus user for many years, the Pixel was a phone to look forward to. But it does have one major drawback. From a hardware perspective the phone is top-of-the-line, with specifications that match anything else on the market at the moment. The camera – particularly its image stabilization and low-light features – is excellent, and the whole unit feels solid and workmanlike. On the software side, getting unlimited photo storage is a great feature (but watch out for telco data charges) and Assistant is nice, if somewhat oversold. The new Android build is excellent and since this phone comes from Google, users will be first in line for OS upgrades and the regular monthly security patches, which is a major selling point for those who pay attention to looking after their data. But the biggest turn-off on the device is the price. Google is the same price as Apple for its iPhone 7 Plus and doesn't have the looks of Cook & Co's top-range handsets – although nor does it use proprietary connectors. You can understand Google's pricing policy – it wants to start reaping the same profits as Apple for its smartphones. But the high price is going to make its core Nexus base abandon the phone at just the time when Chinese manufacturers are offering similar handsets to the Pixel for a much lower cost. It may be that Google can build a smartphone brand that's just as desirable as the iPhone and attracts similar hordes of devoted fans willing to pay the Mountain View equivalent of the Cupertino idiot tax. But I doubt it. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 69 Comments More from The Register Google Pixel pwned in 60 seconds Power of Community Chinese teams kill Safari, laugh at four-second Flash hack 61 Comments Apple fans using Chrome on alert for Mac malware Google AdWords has been spewing software nasties 20 Comments Good God, we've found a Google thing we like – the Pixel iPhone killer Hands-on Well, OK, Chromium's pretty nice – as is this new Android smartie 181 Comments Four reasons Pixel turns flagship Android mobe makers into roadkill Comment Go boutique, or get out of the way 82 Comments Google's Chrome cloaks Pirate Bay in red screen of malware death Scam ads abound 27 Comments Google Pixel: Devices are a dangerous distraction from the new AI interface Analysis Pick a partner, eat the Nougat, feel the love 57 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

By Gary Jones / Published 6th November 2016 SAMSUNG The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge's newest features come straight from the Note 7 After months of turmoil Samsung has finally decided to pull the plug on its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, although it appears one piece of it will live on. The Korean tech giant announced in October that the device would be removed from sale immediately and production stopped. In a statement Samsung said: "We recently readjusted the production volume for thorough investigation and quality control, but putting consumer safety as top priority, we have reached a final decision to halt production of Galaxy Note 7s," However, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is now being refreshed with popular features pinched straight from the doomed Note 7. A new colour – dubbed Blue Coral – is being rolled out by the South Korean firm and is borrowed directly from the now-discontinued smartphone. Pixel camera review - view our images shot on Google's smartphone Saturday, 29th October 2016 THE Pixel camera promises to be the best on the market but is at good as Google thinks it is? 1 / 15 DAILY STAR ONLINE Google Pixel camera review Samsung explains: "The new Blue Coral edition follows this year’s colour trends, which are less vivid and more tranquil. "Inspired by nature, the colour shimmers as if it is illuminated from the inside of the phone’s glass surface. "In particular, Samsung applied a contrasting gold tone hue to the phone’s metallic frame. "The resulting two-toned combination is at once calming and sophisticated." Samsung have also been busy behind the scenes, releasing a new update that brings even more features from the Note 7 to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and regular S7 smartphone.

It will also allow for notifications to be shown - a feature that has yet to be seen on the first for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge range. In a statement, Samsung confirmed: "We have issued a software update delivering certain feature enhancements to the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, which offer a more convenient and customisable mobile experience." The news comes after Samsung recalled the original Note 7 after a number of devices caught fire. Samsung thought they'd fixed the problem but fresh reports of so called "fixed" phones, also exploding has left the firm with no option but to bin the device permanently.

Home News Category news I Category news II Category news III Category news IV About Us Sources Contact Building a Mobile Application For Your Business or Website November 3, 2016manuel0 Comments Filed UnderCategory news I You might consider building a mobile application for your business in the near future. Either for selling or so that users can access your website more easily. This would be of great help for maintaining your visitors loyal. Now think a bit, accessing a website from a phone implies unlocking your phone, accessing your browser, searching on Google for the keywords. Or accessing your bookmarks from withing the browser. Now think a bit, accessing a website from a phone implies unlocking your phone, accessing your browser, searching on Google for the keywords. Or accessing your bookmarks from withing the browser. But wouldn’t it be lovely that once you unlock your phone, right in front of you on the screen there is a nice looking icon that once pressed will open the website you’re trying to access? There are few to none websites that I know about that offer this functionality. If you ever heard of Pat Flynn from Smart Passive Income, he’s the only one that have’s an app for his podcasts and blog posts and I find his app very useful. Really! Sharing this already made me feel like I should’ve kept that to myself. If it came to me it means that others are thinking about it also. Think and act! The next thing that may happen is to see that every website haves such an app to offer on the front page.   How Much Does it Cost to Create an App? [INFOGRAPHIC] Are you considering building a mobile app? Surely, the mobile industry is growing leaps and bounds. In fact, it is projected to turn into a $77-billion-dollar industry in 2017. Before going into the cost, ask yourself first, “Do I actually need a mobile app?” Just because everyone is creating one, doesn’t mean you should have one too! If your answer is yes, know the different factors in mobile app development. There are many variable questions that you should answer. Andrew Gazdecki, CEO at Bizness Apps, has outlined what you need to know to create a mobile app in this infographic below. See more…     You can outsource an app like this sooo sooo easy! Acces FreeLancer, Fiverr or Upwork right now and you will find thousands of talented developers ready to do it for you in exchange for $50 or less! Forget the 50 dollars, think about the value you are getting back from it.   Mobile Internet Usage Surpasses Desktop for First Time Ever Worldwide A press release issued this morning from StatCounter reveals mobile and tablet internet usage has exceeded desktop for the first time ever. In October 2016, mobile and tablet devices accounted for 51.3% of internet usage compared to 48.7% by desktop. This marks the first time worldwide mobile internet usage has eclipsed desktop. There’s no telling if this trend will continue, but mobile web usage has historically grown during the holiday season. Aodhan Cullen, CEO of StatCounter, echoes what SEOs and marketers have been saying for years now — mobile needs to be a priority for more businesses: “This should be a wake up call especially for small businesses, sole traders and professionals to make sure that their websites are mobile friendly. Many older websites are not.” Looking at various parts of the world on their own, statistics show more mature markets, such as US and UK, still use desktop computers as their primary mode of using the internet. Then there are markets like India, for example, where mobile devices account for 75% of all internet usage. Read more…   Looking at the statistics my proposal is more than just an idea. And let’s say that the phone users will never outclass desktop user and if they will, it will drop again just like it happened in October. This idea could still boost your website traffic by 25% (more or less). Would you say “No thanks” to that percentage? I don’t think so. Even 15% even 10% EVEN 5 % that’s still a lot depending on your traffic.

Try out these 5 tricks to get better search results on Google. By: Sneha Saha Published: Saturday, November 5, 2016, 14:00 [IST] To get any information about anything is easy. Just type the keywords on the Google Search engine and you are done. Rather you might just get information that is far more than what you would actually need. However, getting more information than you require is also a little annoying. Searching for the accurate information among the numerous links that Google provides you with is surely a tough task. SEE ALSO: 5 Scams That Every WhatsApp User Should Be Aware Of We at GizBot have come up with a list of effective methods to try out to search the most accurate information on Google in just a few clicks. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Searching Using Synonyms of the Keyword To get better search results, use synonyms of the keyword you are searching for as it is a good option. All you need to type on the search engine is put the keyword you are searching information for, enter "~" symbol and type the synonym. Example: type Healthy~Food, and you'll get information about principles of healthy eating, cooking recipes, and other related stuff. Use Asterisk Sign In case you're not able to remember a word, the "*" symbol comes into play. Just use the asterisk symbol in the place of the word you are unable to remember, and click on the search option, Google will show the related result that you were looking for. Enter Either This or That Sometimes its happens that we often forget whether we are typing the correct keyword on the Google search engine. All that you can do is, enter option and put "or" and enter the option that you are confused with. Google will display the most appropriate result. Searching for a Title or URL In case one needs to find the keywords and name of an article, all that the user can do is just type "intitle:" before the term that you want to search for. Whereas, to find a URL enter "inurl:". Use a Time Frame Sometimes we forget when an event occurred. In such a situation, you can simply add a time frame to your search query with the help of three dots between the dates such as 1900...2000.

Are they the two consequences of the same cathartic loss of Oct 13? Yes, definitely. In light there's also darkness, in grief there's also hatred, and in this strange period of limbo the grip is being tightened. Nine hundred web addresses carrying blasphemous content have been blocked by the government in the past month, 200 by the mothership of Section 44 and 700 by regular court orders. Twenty-five people have been charged with lese majeste in the same period. The army, taking time off from helping farmers harvesting rice, set up a new Cyber Centre on Tuesday to patrol the online universe -- the only battlefield onto which they'll get their boots dirtied these days -- in a bid to beef up our defences against hackers as well as to monitor lese majeste offences. This is a fight on a global scale, an information war waged by a slow, bureaucratic government against the torrents of data, shadow sites, dark webs, proxy servers, encrypted dialogue, hooded hackers and infinite streams of bits and bytes generated by invisible malcontents. The executives of Facebook, Line and Google have been contacted by our high-ranking officials who asked them to monitor and remove content deemed to violate Thai laws. This is not the first time such a request -- it will forever remain a request, not a fatwa someone wishes it to be -- has been made, and as in every case the tech firms respond politely that while they realise the sensitivity of our historic times, they will look into the matter. But we're asking for more. We are enlisting some of the world's biggest innovators in our daydreaming scheme of mass surveillance -- or a mass exorcism against the Satanic verses lurking in the dark. We've asked them to help purge the sins of our apostates even though Google, Facebook and Line practise a different religion: we medieval creatures still believe in a "universe" -- "uni", the one and only -- while the world has moved on to the multiverse where conflicting streams of thoughts, however ugly, or ideological rebellion, however unsound, are frowned upon but hardly a crime. Line in fact denied our request flatly: "We do not monitor or block user content." Google and Facebook agreed to take "appropriate action", a vague statement far from a commitment. We're also asking western countries to extradite lese majeste "fugitives". And no matter how I find some of those anti-establishment's protest tactics dumb and tasteless -- the ideological pornography of Aum Neko for instance -- I wish that Thai authorities stop pretending that their requests would amount to anything. Again, we all know those countries practise a different religion, not a superior or an inferior one, only different, and what is a sin here is not a sin everywhere. Their Judgement Day hasn't yet arrived while we're expediting ours. Google and Facebook won't treat our case as more pressing than, say, a request from Malaysia or Pakistan to weed out online agitators. We're not the universe -- we're just one in an endless stream of cyber-verses. So what we have left now is the new Army Cyber Centre. Operating on tax money, they will stalk and catch violators of the dreaded Section 112, possibly by having hundreds of soldiers hunch over their screens 24/7 like in a sci-fi movie, only that it's less about science and usually more about fiction. And it's also left to the volunteers and "rubbish collector" squad to make the rounds on Facebook hoping to pounce on the malefactors, the provocateurs, the non-believers in our great system. On the surface is a technological battle -- how many proxy servers can you hop if we keep blocking them -- but essentially it is a spiritual one: it's the devout against the infidels. The authorities shouldn't let their insecurity show: they should know that in this country, in this "Thai universe", the "progressive", the "left", the "revolutionary", the "young", the "liberal", whatever the term, will never win, not soon or ever. The entrenched tradition, the comfort of conservatism, the decades of middle-class conditioning -- all of this has ensured that the conformist, the military, the establishment, will always prevail, with or without the help of Google, Facebook and Line. To go around pleading with the rest of the world to believe what we believe is unbecoming, and unnecessary. Hunting down the Antichrists only shows the weakness of your faith -- that it's fallible, destructible, when it's not (is it?). The multiverse contains variation, some worthy, others not, but it has laid out a new ground zero where nothing is unique or unarguable. It's time to keep calm and learn to live with that.

It marches on and on and slowly, gradually but assuredly, sweeps aside everything that is old. The smartphones, in every measure marvels of technology, are doing it since 2007. And finally in 2016, they have reached a position where they are threatening even the mighty DSLR cameras when it comes to clicking photos. At least, the high-end phones like the Google Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus are doing that. No, the phones are still not better than a proper DSLR or a large sensor camera. But the likes of the Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus are so good that for many people, they will be good enough. And in most cases, these high-end expensive phones are definitely better than many cheap compact cameras, even in low and tricky light. Also Read: Pixel XL quick review: Google's love letter to Android fans So, just what is going on? Two things. One, the image sensors and lenses etc have become good in the phones. And two, which is actually the bigger deal, the phone companies are winning it on the basis of their software and all that computing horsepower they are putting in the phones using powerful processors. This refined software and computing power allows phones to process the images in a way that ensures that even if technically, at pixel level, these images aren't as good as the dedicated cameras, they are good enough -- in some cases even better -- compared to images clicked with high-end cameras. Don't believe us? Just take a look at these five comparison shots (the two you can see on the page, for the other three click the links). Also Read: iPhone 7 Plus camera can surpass a DSLR camera. Occasionally These images have been shot with Canon 5D Mark IV, the latest and greatest Canon DSLR camera, the iPhone 7 Plus and the Google Pixel XL. For some observations on these images, scroll past the photos. Other 3 images: Link 1 | Link 2 | Link 3 Some observations One reason why the Pixel XL and and the iPhone 7 Plus look so good in these images is because of the small size. In full-resolution, a DSLR image will look better. Although image quality of the camera in newer phones is fantastic, they are still too slow for razor sharp images of pets or anything or anyone moving. They are slow to focus and slow to click and process images. You can shoot wildlife with a phone camera, unless you are clicking photos of a lumbering elephant or a sleeping hippo. And yes, the pet cat doesn't count in wildlife. For absolute best quality, you can't beat the DSLR, although it does require a lot of effort to create amazing pictures with a big and bulky camera. The convenience of a phone camera is unmatched. Click, apply and filter and share on Instagram. For anyone not shooting for pure pleasure or profession, a phone camera is so much more fun. Nowadays with phones like the iPhone 7 Plus and the Pixel XL being so good, you buy a DSLR camera for its flexibility, its lens options, its ability to be a specialised tool -- a portrait camera or a machine that can freeze a sprinting cheetah in a frame.

It runs Nougat and packs in quality optics. Then, there's the Moto Z, a modular smartphone that trans forms into a point-and-shoot. And finally , the Honor 8, a smartphone that comes with dual rear snappers. All three devices are equipped with top-end chips, high-res scratch-resistant screens, day-long battery life and the USB Type-C interface for fast charging and OTG pen drive support.Read on to find out which one is for you... HONOR 8 Build: The Honor 8 is the new device from Huawei's spinoff brand that builds smartphones for online sales. In keeping with its flagship status, it is fabricated out of aluminium alloy , which is then encased under multiple layers of glass to give it a shimmery look. Its screen is fronted by toughened Gorilla Glass that's scratch resistant and protects against accidental nicks and bumps. The Full HD display renders crisp text and punchy colours with deep blacks and excellent contrast. You also get the option to tweak the colour profile according to your viewing preferences, as well as a reading mode that filters out blue light to reduce eye strain. Overall, the Honor 8 looks plush and feels solid, but with so much glass in its fabrication, we would be extremely nervous if it slipped or fell. User Interface: The handset's customised user interface comes packed with a lot of accessibility settings for improved handling. For instance, you can enable a floating dock that lets you navigate the screen without reaching for the touch controls at the bottom; you can clear background tasks and even lock the display with a tap. Its fingerprint sensor, which also responds as a clickable button, can be used to unlock the handset, answer a call, silence the alarm, and recognise gestures for direct access to the Honor 8's notification panel and photo gallery. You can also assign this "smart key" to launch an app or utility, take a screenshot, etc with a few quick presses. The Honor 8 is equipped with motion recognition that allows you to mute an incoming call by flipping the device over, answer a call by raising the phone to the ear, and more. Plus, you get an infrared port and a companion app to control your television, cable TV box and Bluray player from the handset itself. Performance: The Honor 8 works without any hiccups despite the heavy customisation over the Android Marshmallow OS. In fact, its processor is almost on a par - in terms of synthetic benchmarks - with the chips on the Moto Z and Google Pixel. This means, it runs highdefinition content and intensive 3D games very smoothly . Call quality and network handling is easily one of the best in smartphones, and audio playback with earphones sounds balanced, complete with low bass lines, crisp mid ranges and pronounced highs. On the downside, the music player doesn't include any presets or a graphic equalizer to fine-tune the output.Cameras: The dual rear cameras - one is equipped with a monochrome sensor for detail while the other captures colour - on this handset are quick to focus and take photos that are sharp, and rendered with neutral colours and contain a considerable amount of detail. A depth of field effect lets you decide on the subject you want to focus on even after taking a snapshot. That said, this software optimisation is not perfect, but works well in most cases to give you snapshots that are comparable to those you would shoot on a point and shoot camera. Pictures taken in low light are impressive, retaining detail with minimal image softening.Results can be further improved with the Honor 8's manual mode. You even get presets for scanning documents, photographing food, capturing light trails, shooting slow motion clips, and more.The front snapper takes selfies with neutral colours and slightly muted skin tone, which are still pretty good for sharing online. Battery: Despite its bright, high-res display and processing muscle, the Honor 8 manages to provide well over a day's worth of battery with mixed usage. Plus, you get three power management modes and the ability to lower the screen resolution to save juice. As far as flagship devices go, the Honor 8 ticks all the right boxes. If you're looking for a premium handset that sports eye-catching design, promises consistent top-of-theline performance, great set of cameras (with customisation modes) and battery life, this is worth your consideration. MOTO Z Build: The Moto Z's biggest differentiator is its modular design. Depending on your need, you can opt for a camera mod with 10x optical zoom, a dual 3-watt speaker mod, a 50-lumens projector mod, and a 2220mAh battery attachment (all sold separately).These add-ons snap onto the device magnetically and connect to it via 16 gold contacts on its back. The smartphone is fabricated out of aluminium, stainless steel and toughened glass. You get a textured back cover in the box for when you use the device without its add-ons, and a hard plastic bumper case to protect the edges in case of accidental falls. Like most other Motos, the Z is treated with a water-repellent "nanocoating" to guard against accidental spills. Its Quad HD display renders bright colours, crisp text and is usable even under sunlight. The handset feels solid, but we recommend careful handling when used with its accessories - especially the camera mod - as a fall could lead to both components separating, and even damage to the add on. User Interface: For most part, you get a stock Android Marshmallow interface with subtle additions like Active Display , where sensors detect a wave of your hand to display the date, time and notifications. You can also twist your wrist twice to activate the camera, or shake the handset to activate its rear flash for torch like illumination. A fingerprint sensor adds a layer of security to your device. All in all, the lack of bloatware makes the handset responsive and spiffy . Performance: The Moto Z pairs with the mods seamlessly. Also, you don't need to turn the device off before attaching the mods. The handset posted high scores in synthetic benchmarks, and this processing muscle is reflected in day-to-day use. It handles Full HD movies, as well as 3D games like Modern Combat 5 and War Robots without a problem. Notably , the Moto Z lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead, you will have to use a wireless headset, or invest in a pair of USB Type-C earphones, or use the included converter to use the Moto Z's standard hands-free kit. Considering this is a top-end phone, the included earphones are underwhelming performers with muted highs and dull lows. Calls are clear, crisp, and the Moto Z's handling of networks is comparable to some of the best smartphones that exist. Camera: The rear shooter captures quality stills in well-lit environments. It uses a laser to focus on subjects quickly and the results appear evenly lit with adequate detail and sharpness. Grain begins to appear in photos - and there is also some softening of details - as soon as there is a drop in lighting. Shooting pictures in HDR poses quite another problem: There is a noticeable lag after you press the shutter release button, and moving subjects end up looking blurry because the camera takes a split second to process the shot. The front shooter is quite average; skin tones look pale and washed out. Here, the strong front-facing flash adds some warmth to the frame. Snap on the Hasselblad True Zoom mod (`19,999) and the phone becomes a full-fledged camera - with a 12MP sensor, flash and 10x optical zoom. Photo captures, without magnification, are mostly on a par with the Z's stock camera, except that it achieves better depth of field. Use the zoom lens, and framing a shot requires steady hands. Even though the mod includes optical image stabilisation, shooting at fullzoom results in shots with mixed results. For instance, we managed to take some very good shots of birds under a canopy of leaves, which is not usually possible with a smartphone, but only after a few frustrating tries. Battery: The True Zoom mod draws power from the phone's battery , so long sessions with it will dent the Moto Z's battery life to much less than a day . Thankfully, the JBL SoundBoost Speaker (`6,999) and the Moto Insta-Share Projector (`19,999) mods - which were not available to us for tests - include a 1000mAh and 1100mAh battery , respectively. By itself, you can expect to get a day's worth of work done with a single charge of the Moto Z's battery . Add the battery mod (`5,999), and you can expect almost two days. The Moto Z's modular design will require some tweaking before it becomes truly viable. At present, it is an expensive proposition with each mod costing almost as much as an entire smartphone.Buy if you are an `early adopter' of tech and want bragging rights to owning a phone that can shape shift into a camera, speaker and projector. GOOGLE PIXEL Build: Google's flagship smartphone keeps things simple with a smooth anodised aluminium body and a dual-tone finish on the back panel. You get a bright Quad HD oleophobic toughened display that's responsive and works wonderfully when in the bright outdoors. Colours appear vibrant with excellent contrast. The Pixel will not win any awards for original design, but you will find no reason to complain about its build, which feels solid and well balanced in the hand. Still, for its asking price, we would have preferred if it came with some form of water resistance. User Interface: The Pixel comes with the latest version of Android, called `Nougat'. There's Google Assistant, a personal voice-activated helper, which is an augmented version of Google Now, where you can expect to get some amusing answers for cheeky questions like "What do you like to eat?", " Are you married?".The Assistant was able to understand myriad thick accents we used and it did a fair job of finding answers too. That said, it is unable to extract info locally from the phone as easily as it reveals web results for nearby restaurants and world trivia. You can now preview notifications and perform basic actions (archive an email, reply to an SMS) without unlocking the screen. The notification panel is also redesigned to make it easier to access quick settings, which can be reorganized to your preferences.Visually , icons and text look smaller and crisper. However, Nougat lets you adjust their size as well. Pressing and holding an app icon now displays a contextual menu with quick-action options for that app. For instance, press and hold the Contacts icon to quickly add a new contact; do the same with the Gmail icon to choose Compose, and the Camera icon to choose between "Take a video" or "Take a selfie". With Nougat, you get native support for faster switching between apps: Double tap the Recents button (extreme right control in the navigation panel) to switch between two recently-used apps. This is equivalent to the Alt+Tab shortcut on a Windows machine. And if you long press this control, it enables a multi-window mode. However, this works only with supported apps, which as of now is restricted to Google services like Gmail, Chrome, Maps, etc. You also get unlimited online storage for photos and videos at their original resolution - so you don't have to worry about running out of memory . Performance: The Google Pixel notched the highest scores in synthetic benchmarks, thanks to the currentgen processor purring under the hood. The handset worked fluidly; switching quickly between apps, working across two apps in split-screen mode without freezing up, and playing stutter-free HD games. Simply put, this is one of the most powerful smartphones in the market right now. Camera: Ever since the Pixel's launch, everyone has been talking about its cameras. Well, it's true: this handset is equipped with the best set of smartphone cameras. Portraits taken with the rear camera are sharp with lots of detail and vibrant colours. Low light shots are also impressive; noise is kept under control with little loss of detail. Here, the Pixel uses electronic image stabilisation (EIS) and shots tend to take on a slight yellow tinge. Selfies taken with the front camera are much better than what the Honor 8 and Moto Z were able to manage. There was just the right amount of exposure and warm skin tones. So if you want a good Android handset primarily for a good camera, put your money on the Pixel. Battery: Now with all its processing muscle and sterling hardware, the Pixel XL still manages to eke out almost two days of service before requiring a recharge. This can vary if the device is used for watching movies and mobile photography . The Google Pixel comes at a premium price tag, but it comes with one of the best cameras, the absolute current and fastest mobile processor, and runs the latest version of Android. You also get a Type-C-to-USB cable to connect pen drives for direct file transfers. If budget is not a constraint, get this phone for its hardware, display, battery life and fantastic cameras. It's an all-round winner alright.

However, it comes with a few caveats. By: Prajith Sabbani Updated: Saturday, November 5, 2016, 13:40 [IST] One of the most painful things about switching to a new smartphone is setting it up. Thankfully, if you're one of those who is switching from an Apple iPhone to the recently launched Google Pixel/Pixel XL the process just got a lot easier. Google is bundling the smartphone with a small USB Type-C to Type-A adapter and calls it Quick Switch Adapter. Using this you can transfer data from the iPhone to Pixel flawlessly. All you have to do is connect both the smartphones to the dongle and a Software Wizard will take you through the entire process. SEE ALSO: 5 Scams That Every WhatsApp User Should Be Aware Of However, this process does come with a few caveats. In this article, we will list the step-by-step procedure to transfer data from your old smartphone and then later discuss the limitations. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Connect Apple iPhone and Google Pixel to the Quick Switch adapter To begin with, you have to connect both the Apple iPhone and the Google Pixel to the bundled Quick Switch adapter. Give Pixel the access to your iPhone Once you've connected both the smartphones to the dongle, a pop-up will show up on your iPhone asking if it should "Trust" the Google Pixel. Click on the Trust button, as soon as you do it, the Pixel smartphone will be given access to all the data it can copy from the iPhone. Choose the data you intend to transfer As soon as Google is done with searching your iPhone for copyable data, choose the content you intend to transfer from the options displayed on your Pixel's screen. Some of the options include Calendar, Contacts, Email, Message attachments, iMessages, Music, Photos, and Videos among others. That's it you're done with transferring data from your old smartphone to the new Google Pixel/ Pixel XL. Eligibility Criteria This process is same for both Pixel and Pixel XL and works with all the iPhones which run on iOS 8 and above. It also works with other Android smartphones if the handset runs Android 5.0 Lollipop or above. Caveats Let's start with the Calendar app, despite the fact that Google can move all the data such as calendar appointments from iPhone to Google Calendar app, it can't stay synced with your iCloud calendar. Which means if you share your iCloud calendar with another iCloud user, any changes made here will not be reflected on the Google Calendar app. Similarly, all your iMessage conversations will be transferred to the Messages app on your Pixel/Pixel XL, however, if you reply to those messages you'll be charged with standard SMS rates. Also, according to Pocket-lint, some music tracks may also be not copied from the iPhone owing to the copyright issues.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Social Google moves to revamp Play Store to help developers Google moves to revamp Play Store to help developers Google is redoubling efforts to help developers of Android mobile apps build their businesses with a Play Store revamp. By: Reuters | Published:November 5, 2016 1:42 pm Google is revamping the Play Store to help out app developers. Alphabet Inc’s Google is redoubling efforts to help developers of Android mobile apps build their businesses as concerns mount that the app economy has reached saturation. Under the leadership of Sameer Samat, who rejoined Google earlier this year after a spell as president of wearable tech firm Jawbone, the company is sharpening Google Play store recommendations with artificial intelligence and expanding support for various payment platforms, among other initiatives. Google’s efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple Inc, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers. Both companies face a chorus of complaints from developers who say they are struggling to stand out in a jam-packed field. Many smartphone users, meanwhile, appear to have tired of downloading apps altogether, especially as messaging services like Snapchat perform more of the functions that once required a separate app. Games remain a focus of the Google Play store, and Nintendo Co Ltd is building a version of its popular Super Mario Run game for Android, said Samat, who leads product management for the Google Play store. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google’s Chromebook laptops.  “What we are excited about is giving developers that single entry point for more and more of the computing ecosystem,” said Samat. ANDROID WILD WEST Google has eased the once-complicated process of developing apps for the Play store, said James Knight, a former Google employee who launched Pembroke, a consultancy that helps developers convert Apple-compatible iOS apps to the Android operating system. “The App Store has historically been a little more straightforward, and Android has been a bit more like the Wild West,” he said. Mirroring the larger smartphone market, the Google Play store sees far more activity by virtue of its placement on the wide range of devices running the Android operating system – but Apple claims more of the profits. The Google Play store accounted for 70 percent of app downloads in the third quarter of this year, but Apple’s App Store logged 65 percent of the revenue, according to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm. Also read: Google Play’s new feature will queue downloads for WiFi: Report A big part of Google’s new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone. The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing, a popular payment method in emerging markets where consumers often do not have credit cards. Google now offers the payment method in 47 markets. To improve app recommendations for users, the Play store has also made extensive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that gleans insights from vast troves of data. Google’s Play store and machine learning teams began collaborating three years ago, and a partnership was struck last year with Google Brain, a cutting-edge research project. The jolt of artificial intelligence is welcome as developers hunt for an audience for their apps, said Greg Cohn, chief executive of Burner, which makes an app that provides temporary phone numbers. “The harsh reality is that there are a few apps that get the vast majority of people’s time and attention,” he said.

Mozilla and Google have pulled the extension from their stores after a report aired on German national television that the company was selling the browsing history of its users. The browser extension, designed to inform users about security or privacy issues on sites they visit, is currently not available for download. Users who try to open the add-on site on Mozilla's Firefox add-ons site get a "we're sorry, but we can't find what you're looking for" error message currently. Google's Chrome Web Store merely states that "the requested URL was not found on this server". Information is scarce at this point as both Mozilla and Google have not openly released information about the removal. The German newspaper FAZ managed to get a statement from Mozilla about the removal. According to the statement, Web of Trust was pulled because it violated add-on guidelines, and specifically transparency in regards to the add-on's collection of user data. According to Web of Trust, which Faz got a statement from as well, this was caused by the company's latest privacy policy published on the company website not being made available on the Firefox add-on site. If you check out the privacy policy on the Web of Trust website, you will notice that it collects the following information: IP address, geographic location, type of device, operating system and browser, date and time, browsing usage including visited web pages, clickstream date or web address accessed, browser identifier and user ID. Users who have Web of Trust installed in the browser won't be affected by the pulling of the add-on. According to research posted on Bugzilla@Mozilla, the tracking that is been discussed in German media has been added to the extension back in 2015. So what is going to happen now? The most likely cause of action is the following one. Web of Trust updates the privacy policy on the store pages of the add-on to better highlight the data collecting of the add-on. Mozilla and Google will then re-enable the extension on their Stores so that users can download and install it again. It is unclear right now whether WOT is asked to modify code of its extension in regards to user tracking, or if the simple highlighting of the fact that the add-on collects user data is enough for restoration. Now You: What's your take on the whole situation? Summary Article Name Mozilla and Google remove WOT extension from Store Description The popular browser extension Web of Trust is no longer available on the Firefox add-on repository or the Google Chrome Web Store.

They should have their code audited (as every extension should) to be validated.. this safe until proven otherwise clearly doesn't work. Reply khidreal November 5, 2016 at 10:17 am # WOT is totally an extension I will avoid. where's the good old Opensource/free software (including extensions) made to just help people that live through donations? people that make something, waste their time to help others, waste their money, and don't ask for nothing. that's people that I would support every month if I had some extra money, that's people that we should care about, developers that make something in exchange of nothing. for me, devs like the ones behind WOT that collect everything a user does online are scam. I will totaly avoid WOT. Reply Paranam Kid November 5, 2016 at 10:31 am # I am always concerned by privacy violations, as is the case here. Nevertheless, the info WOT supplies about websites' trustworthiness is ver important. I don't know any other extension that supplies this kind of info without raping you at the same time. And I consider security more important than privacy, so will not uninstall WOT. I did implement the uBlockO filtering that Tom Howach mentioned on this site yesterday. Reply Helpful November 5, 2016 at 10:46 am # Bitdefender Trafficlight Reply Parker Lewis November 5, 2016 at 12:54 pm # These rules only have a chance to work if the WoT leaks are filtered by the lists you use with uBO. That also assumes that these leaks can be separated by rules from legitimate WoT traffic needed for the extension to work. (I never used WoT but I don't think they can.) I wouldn't consider myself protected unless I verified this first hand. An alternative is to only use the website WoT, not the add-on, so in practise it would only be for sites you have a reason to doubt. You could use a bookmark keyword "wot ghacks.net" or add a WoT search engine or something to make the website check as quick as possible. Reply Tom Hawack November 5, 2016 at 2:58 pm # "An alternative is to only use the website WoT, not the add-on, so in practise it would only be for sites you have a reason to doubt." I agree.

Reply Yelan November 6, 2016 at 2:02 pm # David is trying to say that add-on signing does absolutely NOTHING to keep potentially dangerous extensions from being installed, because it only controls who is allowed to distribute extensions, and doesn't do anything about lack of integrity of the add-ons themselves. So it has EVERYTHING to do with add-on signing (which is supposed to keep the "bad ones" out, by definition). redblue November 5, 2016 at 11:49 am # One of the worst privacy violations of the 21st century, I hope the addon never returns in any form. Reply Tom Hawack November 5, 2016 at 11:51 am # I've never used WOT not because I feared privacy issues but because I disliked the very concept, that of people interfering in the fame or shame of a Web site, too subjective and at worst too much of a temptation to praise or condemn on the ground of personal feelings. Now that privacy issues seem to be factual is of course a +minus. On the other hand, if questionable behaviors need to be questioned and negative answers followed by sanctions, we all know that the planetary hysteria loves to hate as it loves to love, that it loves to feel and express emotions rather than objectivity. WOT's crucifixion will undoubtedly be acclaimed by many of which some as always with the "hang 'em up and high" state of mind (or whatever was the wording in that Wild West). I'll just keep on avoiding WOT should it re-appear. Reply Paranam Kid November 5, 2016 at 12:29 pm # The idea of having many people voting on the trustworthiness of a site is that the chance of undue negative or positive bias is minimised. I don't believe that a good site can be sunk by a bandwagon effect of negative votes, nor that a bad site can be turned positive by a bandwagon effect. I don't know of any other extension that gives similar a visual warning or approval of sites; I do rely heavily on that from WOT.

The problem the pathetic lack of a decent permissions model where add-ons are concerned, let alone the web overall. Compared to the mobile phone app ecosystems, the web is sorely lacking in this regard. As a huge supporter of the open web, this is greatly distressing to me. The vast majority of people DO NOT READ privacy policies. To suggest that users be expected to do so is ludicrous. Users are not all lawyers! The best way to ensure users are conscious of the choices they're making and privacy they're relinquishing when installing an add-on, is to create the sort of framework of per-activity/function permission system Android 6 and the like currently implement. I'm sure it's not perfect but compared to the web's invisible privacy / permissions framework, the mobile phone system is like a rolls royce compared to a trabant. Reply wonton November 5, 2016 at 5:10 pm # wot for firefox had a remote code execution vulnerability where wot or another addon could use wot to execute any code with system level privileges this was one determine factor that got wot removed. the researcher could not see any cases where this was abused but who know what wot did they changed owners without telling anyone then the code to collect data was added. this seems to be a popular trend where addons a selling out with large user bases then updates land doing very questionable things.

It is an alarming trend Reply Dan82 November 5, 2016 at 7:58 pm # Let them post a new privacy policy and/or terms of service and allow them to be listed again, only for people to ignore those pieces of text anyway? I think, for the credibility of their web-stores, both Google and Mozilla should either ban the piece of software entirely now and in the future, or if they don't, then at the very least they need to create an extension rating/categorization system that can tell even the average end-user if his or her privacy will be compromised by using this or that extension. Doubt that'll happen though, because both companies (the former without a doubt but in some ways also the latter) are interested in making money from user data. Reply DwightStegall November 5, 2016 at 9:02 pm # I'm really pissed off about this. I don't care if they're selling my history. It's a small price to pay for safety on the web. Now I'm such with crappy Mcafee Site Advisor. Almost all software gathers users data. No one says anything about that. :( Reply Tom Hawack November 5, 2016 at 9:28 pm # There are means to be safe -- or at least as safe as with WOT -- without the cost of one's data. I cannot and will never get undressed for either a service or a protection : neither prostitution nor an accepted racket. That's the tend, that's how many companies wish the scenario to be and to be understood as such. Of course some of us don't care and get undressed free, some do care and get a service/protection for getting undressed, and some do care even more and get a service/protection without getting undressed. There's always a price, but my privacy is worth more than what is offered. My privacy is priceless. Business is planetary now, especially with the Internet. Broader the audience wider the number of those who accept to exchange their privacy for a service/protection, and that should be far enough to keep the business machine rolling, hence allow those who refuse to keep on getting many things free : it's called a population's disparity. If business cannot deal with that then it'll be what it is already : a combat. Reply Dwight Stegall November 6, 2016 at 7:28 am # Probably half of the free software does that. Why are they singling out WOT? Undressed? Prostitution? What drug are you on? :( Tom Hawack November 6, 2016 at 11:26 am # WOT is not a victim of persecution but happens to have been caught. WOT is not the only only, other sites have similar practices among which some haven't been caught. OK. Yet, this attitude "All or so many do it than what the heck? Why not take the good and accept the bad?" seems to me a cynical, hence a defeatist attitude, a trending one especially amid the younger generation. Honesty, integrity together with talent and skill exist everywhere in life, on the Internet as well. You have to make the effort to find them and of course no motivation for effort if cynicism leads one's thoughts or if cynicism is the pretext of laziness. Your "Probably half the sites does that" is meaningless and can be easily toggled to "half the sites doesn't do that". Being concerned by security without having to pay the price of our privacy aims to search for that other half. But it requires indeed efforts and not the easy way out, that of defeatism. Paddleless November 5, 2016 at 10:29 pm # I uninstalled WOT when I realized that the ratings there could not be relied on.

Thanks again, made my day. i would like to add that when i tried to create them myself they would've worked but i just realized an add-on "Clean Links"-(Firefox) i have is the reason they weren't working, have to click on it to disable it otherwise it just opens the homepage of the website i'm trying to use it on. Also, Martin, maybe you should do a quick article on this as i'm sure some of your other users might find this interesting and useful. i have all the JavaScript Bookmarklets in a folder on my bookmarks toolbar for easy access, each one paired with the actual homepage bookmark both between separators to easily tell them apart.

Tom Hawack November 11, 2016 at 1:01 pm # @ Rick, I'm as well a bookmarklet fan, these are so handy; as well I have a dedicated Bookmarks Toolbar sub-folder, including some of those you mentioned together with others, of which several don't call a site but simply operate a function on the site they're called from, for instance toggling a site from http to https : javascript:((function(){window.location=location.href.replace(/^http/i,"https").replace(/^http\w{2,}/i,"http");})()); To be noted : 1- Javascript must be active, of course; also, if using an add-on such as uBlockO, per-site scripting must not be disabled. 2- Firefox Add-ons such as 'Clean Links' or 'Skip Redirect' must include in their options exceptions to handle sites called by bookmarklets... 2.1- 'Clean Links' add-on : add in its Options / Skip Domains domains included in a bookmarklet (the called domain, not the calling domain, i.e. "www.virustotal.com" if using the VirusTotal bookmarklet). 2.2- 'Skip Redirect' add-on : same as with 'Clean Links' but this time in 'Skip redirects' Options / Exceptions. I prefer 'Skip Redirect' to 'Clean Links' now, because the latter seems outdated and problematic here... One last bookmarklet "pour la route" as we say in French (no idea how to translate that, means something like "in case of, to be sure"), which performs a call to PrintFriendly which prints (or PDF) the page it's called from in a neat way : javascript:void(open('http://www.printfriendly.com/print/?url='+location.href)) Bookmarklets are a great tool applicable in many situations and concerning many topics. When it appears to be tough to make our own searching the Web sometimes brings the answer, i.e. the bookmarklet for VirusTotal which I would have been unable to determine myself. To end with the artist's feeling : 'bookmarklet' sounds so nice :) Rick November 14, 2016 at 2:23 am # @Tom Hawack - i've tried that https bookmarklet and it works and does what it's supposed to do, i like it and i've bookmarked that one as well, thanks. i have noticed on some sites it doesn't work as well as https everywhere add-on, say nike.com because the URL changes more than just an "s", like "http://store.nike.com/us/en/" to "https://secure-store.nike.com/us/en_us/" but i don't even recommend https everywhere on nike.com anyway unless maybe your in checkout because it will cause trouble while viewing items/changing colors/changing sizes, it's been a goofy site anyway since they redone it years ago, the site has been finicky with Firefox at times while trying to check out and complete purchases even in safe mode, i had to complete the purchase in google chrome on Windows XP but that was the first other browser i tried, and Firefox is the only browser i will install on my windows 7/10 laptops, so i will try Edge next time if i have the same issue. That print friendly bookmarklet i bookmarked as well, i'm not sure yet what the advantages are if any as i've not tried it yet but it's interesting non the less. i haven't tried that "Skip Redirect" add-on yet either but have bookmarked that in my Firefox folder with the other add-ons i use and will give it a try and look at it's settings, i don't think i'll be able to make my own, i don't know if "Clean Links" you can make your own either but i tried. When doing some research i found "Redirector" - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirector/ in a posting which i didn't bookmark but it was someone wanting to default to YouTube gaming for certain videos and someone recommended the "Redirector" add-on and posted this image which i did bookmark - https://imgur.com/MA50RE1 - and it shows how to do it. i wanted to default to a clean YouTube video URL such as - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ItsgC0FNZc when i receive a video by e-mail instead of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ItsgC0FNZc&feature=em-uploademail - i could not get it to work for me. if you know of a way to get it to work or another add-on that will do it and easy to work with i would appreciate it very much even though i hate to ask as i feel i've been bothering you already in this thread, if so i'm sorry in advance, but thanks once again for all your input in this thread, it has been very useful. pHROZEN gHOST November 6, 2016 at 11:10 pm # I reported the extension as a bad one to Mozilla when not too long after it came out.

The Dublin-based subsidiary – through which the search engine giant diverts sales from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa – revealed the same on Friday. However, the highlight of the company's financial statements was that despite such large revenues, it had paid just €46.5m in Irish corporation tax. Google Ireland said this was because its taxable profits were just €341m. It further explained that its profits were low amid an increase in its "administrative expenses". The subsidiary said that these expenses had increased by €3.5bn to €16.9bn in 2015. It attributed the increase to "increased head count", an "increase in sales and marketing effort", and "an increase in the royalties paid to a group undertaking". While the company did not provide too many details about these expenses, it said the Irish operations saw a 6% increase in total employees to 2,763 people in 2015. It said apart from these staff, it also had about 3,000 contract employees in Ireland. "As Google grows, Ireland continues to benefit...In 2015 we opened our second data centre, bringing total investment in capital assets in Ireland to over €750m," Ronan Harris, the outgoing head of its Irish operations was quoted as saying by the Irish Times. The Dublin-based firm added that total salaries paid had increased by about €365m in 2015. This indicated that Google Ireland's primary administrative expenses were made up of cash royalties paid to another Google subsidiary. While these statements did not disclose the location of the subsidiary to which the royalties were paid, according to the Guardian, all the royalties paid will eventually be directed to a business group called Google Holdings Ireland, which along with Google Ireland Limited are said to be part of the "Double Irish" arrangement. This arrangement is said to be a tax strategy used by some multinationals to lower their corporate tax liability. Being registered as an unlimited company, Google Holdings Ireland is not required to file accounts, under Irish company law. Moreover, it is not charged any corporation tax by Bermuda, the country where it is registered as a tax resident. Hence every year the company is said to save billions of dollars in taxes. Of this Irish income, more than $7bn (£5.59bn) is said to have flowed in from transactions with advertisers in the UK. This declaration by Google Ireland follows former chancellor George Osborne commenting in March that he would bring in a measure aimed at closing tax loopholes. He had then said that this measure, which was called the 'google tax' or more formally the diverted profits tax, would help raise £3.1bn ($3.88bn).

Cincinnati, Ohio (PRWEB) November 05, 2016 InfoTrust is excited to announce their recent certification in Google’s Data Studio 360 platform. A reporting and data visualization tool, Google Data Studio 360 is bringing business reporting into the digital age by breaking down data silos, building auto-updating reports and creating beautiful visualizations that engage teams. Data Studio 360 is the perfect compliment to the Google Analytics 360, Google Tag Manager and Optimize 360 services already provided by InfoTrust. “A popular phrase around our office is ‘Data is the new management.’ We strongly believe that when people use data to make decisions, they are better informed and are more likely to generate favorable outcomes in all aspects of the business. That said, no one will use the data if reports are consistently out-of-date or difficult to read. That’s what we love about Data Studio 360; anyone can build reports that engage those that need to use them day-in and day-out,” says Alex Yastrebenetsky, InfoTrust CEO. In this highly technology-based era, many businesses are still exporting data offline and creating static reports. A snapshot in time, these reports take both a significant amount of time to create and do not provide those that use the reports with up-to-the-minute data with which to make business decisions. Google Data Studio 360 is determined to change this, allowing users to build reports and data visualizations that combine data from multiple sources and auto-update based on user input. About InfoTrust LLC: InfoTrust LLC is a digital analytics consulting and technology company that makes marketers happy with stress-free analytics. They combine tools for quality data collection with a powerful professional services team to help business leaders maximize results.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: November 5, 2016 1:18 pm Alphabet Inc’s venture capital arm CapitalG, earlier known as Google Capital, disclosed an investment in Snapchat. Alphabet Inc’s venture capital arm CapitalG, earlier known as Google Capital, disclosed an investment in Snapchat by adding the social networking firm’s logo to a page on its investment portfolio website. CapitalG has not made a formal announcement and it was not clear when Google made the investment. The company was not immediately available to comment. Snap Inc, which operates the popular messaging app Snapchat, has hired Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc as lead underwriters for an initial public offering. The banks were notified last month that they had been awarded one of most coveted and potentially lucrative IPO mandates in recent years, as the Venice, California-based company vies for a $25 billion valuation in the stock market. Snapchat, which lets users send smartphone photos which automatically disappear after a few seconds, has proven popular among teenage users. The company had reportedly rejected an acquisition offer from Facebook Inc that would have valued the company at $3 billion or more in 2013. Snapchat, which first went live in 2011, has seen its daily active users cross Twitter. According to reports, the messaging app has over 150 million daily active users, which is still smaller compared to say Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram. However, that hasn’t stopped Facebook from trying to copy features of Snapchat as it seeks to boost engagement. Instagram now has Stories, which are an exact copy of the feature on Snapchat, except the photo-sharing app doesn’t yet support live filters for faces like the latter. WhatsApp beta might soon be getting a Stories-style feature in the Status Update tab, according to early testers. Interestingly Facebook is also testing live face filters on its camera app in some countries and plans to roll it out soon to the world as well. Meanwhile, Snapchat is also looking at hardware, and recently launched its first smart spectacles, which are priced at $130 and called Snap Specs. These funky sunglasses will let a user record 10-second video snippets and upload them to their Snapchat account. The camera uses a 115-degree wide angle lens, but unlike Google Glasses, these are pitched more as fun toys aimed at the younger population which is Snapchat’s core user base. Snapchat also recently introduced ads between stories as a new form of monetization for the app. With Reuters inputs © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don’t like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 15: Latest News Punjabis react to Trump’s decision to deport illegal immigrants: ‘May affect economy, hit unscrupulous travel agents’ Securities and Exchange Commission Chair leaving at end of Obama administration INLD hits out at Congress, BJP for ‘doublespeak’ Punjab, Haryana should resolve SYL issue amicably: BJP union minister Narendra Singh Tomar Ahead of special session, Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal yet to accept Cong MLAs’ resignation                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Earlier this year in February, Google teamed up with large number of global operators to accelerate the availability of RCS on Android devices. Earlier this week Google started rolling out Rich Communication Service (RCS) for select Google Messenger users. Now it has officially announced that it has partnered with U.S. carrier Sprint to launch RCS messaging to their customers using Android devices, starting today. Regarding this, Google, on the official blog, said: This will bring enhanced features including group chat, high-res photo sharing, read receipts, and more to the standard messaging experience on Android. Sprint subscribers will have their standard SMS experience upgraded through the Messenger app for Android devices, developed by Google. The service will be powered by the Jibe RCS cloud from Google. All new Android devices from Sprint will come with Messenger for Android pre-loaded as the default SMS and RCS messaging starting from 2017. Subscribers currently using select LG and Nexus phones from Sprint will automatically get an app update to enable this feature, and subscribers using other Android devices can download Messenger from the Play store. Google said that it is planning to launch RCS messaging with more partners in the coming months. "Google launches RCS messaging for Android devices", 5 out of 5 based on 10 ratings.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 5 November 2016 | MYT 8:00 AM NFL throws first VR pass to Google Daydream, YouTube by todd spangler Throwing a VR pass to Google: NFL Films is partnering with Google to produce a nine-part series offering a 360º perspective of life in and around the NFL, covering players, coaches, executives, cheerleaders and fans. — AFP LOS ANGELES: The National Football League is producing its first original VR series, launching exclusively on YouTube and Google's Daydream View virtual-reality headset starting later this month.  But the project underscore that it's still early in the VR game – with the league tapping the tech as a promotional fan-engagement vehicle, rather than a revenue driver.  NFL Films will produce a nine-part series offering a 360º perspective of life in and around the NFL, covering players, coaches, executives, cheerleaders and fans. The series of five- to 10-minute episodes, marking the first episodic VR sports programme, will center on how the denizens of Football Nation prepare for game day.  The VR content will be free, with the first episode of the series to be available on the NFL's YouTube channel on Thanksgiving Day (Nov 24). Later this year, episodes will also be available via the NFL's VR app designed for Daydream View, Google's mobile VR headset that works with its new Pixel phones set to begin shipping Nov. 10, along with other immersive experiences.  "Virtual reality is an emerging platform that enables content experiences with a truly unique vantage point that brings fans closer to the game," said Vishal Shah, the NFL's senior VP of digital media. "We want to get better acquainted with the technology, the platform, the content we can actually create... and how our fans are engaging in the content and viewing it."  Shah declined to say what the NFL is spending on the VR series. Google is contributing staff and equipment for the project, and is helping the NFL develop the app for the Daydream View platform. NFL Films also is working with production company Two Bit Circus VR on the series.  NFL Films is currently in production on the series, which is being shot using Google's Jump 360º camera rig system. In the first episode, viewers will spend a week with the Philadelphia Eagles' defensive line as they prepare for an upcoming game.  Subsequent episodes will tag along with the Miami Dolphins cheerleaders, go inside Green Bay's distinctive football culture, and offer an insider's look at the San Diego Chargers organization.  The league experimented with virtual reality in 2015, and showcased some initial VR content at events including Super Bowl 50's NFL Experience fan convention in San Francisco.  The NFL launched its official YouTube channel in January 2015, and since then it's generated more than 1 billion video views.  The YouTube channel currently carries game previews, in-game highlights, post-game recaps, and news, analysis, fantasy football advice, and other short-form content from NFL Media properties.  Additionally, 96 classic NFL games – three for each of the league's 32 teams – are posted in their entirety on the NFL's YouTube channel. — Reuters You May Be Interested Legislature gives final approval to autonomous vehicle bills After Airbnb and Uber, wardrobe rental services could be the next travel trend For some, the Zune is not gone and definitely not forgotten Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Photo: Bloomberg San Francisco: Snap Inc. amended its charter to ensure that its founders retain majority voting control after the company’s initial public offering, giving them more control than the founders at Facebook Inc. and Google had after those companies went public. Separately, Google quietly made an undisclosed investment in Snapchat. Chief executive officer Evan Spiegel and co-founder and chief technology officer Bobby Murphy together control about 74% of the company, according to an analysis by Equidate, a stock market for private technology companies. That compares with the 41% that Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin had after their IPO, and the 56% Mark Zuckerberg held after Facebook’s. Snap, formerly known as Snapchat, is asking public-market investors to back its management team and support their potential to build the next technology juggernaut. The company behind the social media app that’s wildly popular with teens and millennials is aiming to raise as much as $4 billion in an IPO that could value it at $25 billion to $35 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. This year, Snap is aiming for revenue of $350 million. Snap plans to go public as early as March. The filing Monday in Delaware, which laid out the founders’ voting rights, indicates that the company is cleaning up its ownership structure in preparation. Google seems to approve. Alphabet Inc.’s growth equity division, previously called Google Capital, renamed itself to CapitalG on Friday. With the re-brand, the firm also disclosed a recent investment in Snap. A spokeswoman for CapitalG declined to share the total investment.

They’re both supposed to be smart assistants, and part of that is answering your questions, no matter how dumb they are. In some cases, Alexa relies on skills that you have to enable, and those are only as good as the third-party creators make them. I tried asking Alexa for a Barefoot Contessa recipe, but even with the Food Network skill enabled, she was stumped. For many of its answers, the Google Home pulls from Google’s knowledge graph. Sometimes that makes for helpful answers, but other times, the answers are not quite right or out of date. Related: Is there an Echo in here? How Google Home compares to Amazon’s Bluetooth speaker Here’s what happened when we asked the Amazon Dot and the Google Home a number of the same questions. Both are pretty good at giving the news. What’s the news? Alexa: “Here’s your flash briefing…” followed by NPR news, which I selected as one of my preferences. Home: “Here’s the latest news…” followed by an NPR news summary brought to me by a Chipotle ad. And they can each answer straightforward questions: When is Pi Day? Alexa: Pi Day will be on Tuesday, March 14, 2017. Home: Pi Day is on Tuesday, March 14, 2017. It’s easy enough to ask either Alexa or Google Home for the weather, but I wanted to try something a little more colloquial: Do I need a coat? Alexa: “I added coat to your shopping list.” Home: “Today in Portland, expect a high of 64 degrees and a low of 46 degrees.” Similarly, instead of asking specifically about the World Series during Game 7, I went for a less direct approach: “How are the Cubs doing?”   Alexa: “I don’t know how to answer your question. Home: “The Cubs are up six to three…” I honestly needed to know the answer to this question and decided to put Alexa and the Home to the test: What’s a substitute for coriander? Alexa: “Hm, I’m not sure what you meant by that question.” Home: “According to Rachael Ray, if you are preparing a dish with dried coriander, cumin is a great substitution, as it provides a similar warm, spicy flavor.” Home also pointed out that cilantro, “which people either love or hate,” are the leaves of the coriander plants. Neither is all that great at giving recipes, though: What should I make for dinner tonight? Alexa: “Hm, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.” Home: “Let’s look for dinner options. What kind of food are you looking for?” I said, “Something healthy,” and the Home gave me a list of nearby restaurants. What’s a good chicken recipe? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question.” Home: “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet.” Next, I decided to get political: Who should I vote for? Alexa: “You should vote for the candidate who best reflects your views and has the best policies.” Home: “How you vote is up to you. I can look up information on the election, if you like.” Me: “OK.” Home: … Me: “What should I know about the election?” Home: “I can’t help with that yet.” Who’s going to win election? Alexa: “I can’t tell you who will win, but I can tell you who’s ahead in the polls. Just ask, who’s ahead in the polls.” Me: “Who’s ahead in the polls?” Alexa: “According to Real Clear Politics’ average of national polling data between October 22 and November 1, Hillary Clinton is polling at 45.1 percent, Donald Trump at 43.1 percent, Gary Johnson at 4.6 percent, and Jill Stein at 2.1 percent.” Home: “Sorry, I’m not sure how to help.” Me: “Who’s ahead in the polls?” Home: “Sorry, I’m not sure how to help, but I’m always learning.” Then I wanted to test their bilingual skills: How do you say “Hello” in Spanish? Alexa: “I can’t pronounce that but I’ve written the translation for you.” Home: “Buenos Dias!” How do you say, “I don’t know” in French? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question.” Home: “Je ne sais pas.” I actually knew the answer to this next question, but I was trying to think of something a five-year-old would ask: What do koalas eat? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question. Home: “Leaves. According to Australian Koala Foundation, an adult koala eats between 200 to 500 grams of leaves each day. Koalas eat mainly eucalyptus leaves. Occasionally, they will eat the leaves from some other native Australian trees, and they also use certain trees just for resting in.” Note: When I was transcribing the answer, I had to ask the question a couple of times, and Home once gave me the definition for equality instead. Both have some decent entertainment skills: Tell me a joke Alexa: “Why wasn’t the turkey hungry on Thanksgiving? Because he’s already stuffed.” Home: “What do you get when you put a vest on an alligator? An investigator.” Neither gave me exactly what I wanted when it came to this music request, though: Play “Dreaming” by Smashing Pumpkins Alexa: Played a 30-second preview, since I didn’t have it saved to my music library. Home: Started playing Siamese Dream I saw the casting news yesterday but couldn’t remember it: Who’s going to be in the Wrinkle in Time movie? Alexa: “Hm, I can’t find an answer to the question I heard.” Home: “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet.” Note: I was thinking of Rowan Blanchard, but apparently Zach Galifianakis has been cast as well. I figured this was a pretty straightforward question but both struggled: How many Grammys has Beyoncé won? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t know the answer to that question.” Home: “Beyoncé won the Grammy Award for Best R&B song.” Note: That’s just one of Beyoncé’s 20 Grammys. The Home’s answer to this made me think of this Simpsons moment: How many kids does Brad Pitt have? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t know the answer.” Home: “Six. His children include Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt, and others.” The Jolie-Pitt kids in turn made me think of Mindy Kaling. Google Home has the ability to answer follow-ups without you having to repeat who or what you’re talking about, so I wanted to test that out. I still had to say “Mindy Kaling” for every follow-up with Alexa, though: How old is Mindy Kaling? Alexa: “Mindy Kaling is 37 years old.” Me: “Is Mindy Kaling married?” Alexa: “Sorry, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.” Me: “Is Mindy Kaling’s show still on?” Alexa: “Hm, I couldn’t find any movies called Mindy Kaling.’” Home: “Mindy Kaling is 37 years old.” Me: “Is she married?” Home: “According to E!, Mindy Kaling and BJ Novak’s relationship remains complicated. The 35-year-old actress…” Me: Is her show still on? Home: “Here’s some information for, ‘Is Ellen’s show still on…’” Finally, I wanted to see how much they knew about each other: How much does the Amazon Dot cost? Alexa: “The new Amazon Dot costs $49.99.” Home: “According to Business Insider, Amazon Prime membership costs $99 per year…” How much does Google Home cost? Alexa: “Hm, I’m not sure what you meant by that question.” Home: “Google Home costs $129.

Due to the technological constraints imposed by simple messaging service (SMS), the cellular standard which powers basic text messaging, cellular messaging lacks support for the sort of animations, videos, and stickers which most clients boast. But that’s about to change. On Friday, Google announced that it will begin rolling out an advanced texting standard called rich client messaging, or RCS, to Android phones on the Sprint network. RCS is best described as text messaging on steroids — basically, it’s a modernized version of SMS that brings the aging standard up to par with clients like iMessage and Facebook Messenger. It supports features like group chats, read receipts (timestamps that indicate when a message has been received and seen), high-resolution photo sharing, and typing indicators (the animations that indicate when chat participants are pecking out sentences). It can transmit images and videos up to 100 times larger than multimedia text messaging, the outgoing standard that currently performs that legwork. And it features robust support for group messaging, including the ability to name groups, add new members, and leave existing groups. Related: Google Messenger 2.0 brings unread message badges — on certain Android devices The upgrade will begin in earnest later this year. Sprint subscribers with Android devices running KitKat 4.4 will see RCS become available in the coming weeks, provided they’ve installed Google’s Messaging application from Android’s Play Store app market and selected it as their default messaging app. Select LG and Nexus phones, meanwhile, will be “automatically upgraded” to RCS through a forthcoming app update. And owners of Google’s Pixel devices, which ship with Messenger preloaded, will have access to RCS as long as they don’t switch their default messaging app to another client. Eligible users will be notified via popup message when RCS becomes available. From within Messenger, they’ll be able to toggle a few of the standard’s features including read receipts, typing indicators, and whether or not data’s used for messaging. Taking advantage of RCS won’t be nearly as complicated in the future. Beginning next year, all Android devices sold by Sprint will come with Messenger configured as the default texting app. Related: T-Mobile breaks the limitations of regular, boring text messaging with advanced messaging  The launch is the fruit of Google’s Jibe Mobile purchase. The company’s technology, which Google acquired late last year, forms the framework of Google’s Universal RCS platform, a standardized text messaging platform the company announced at Mobile World Congress in February. In a speech to attendees, a Google representative promised a “consistent” and “inter-operable” version of the RCS spec that would work with non-Android devices and integrate with third-party APIs and open source tools. Indeed, Google’s RCS ambitious extend far beyond the Sprint network. The company intends to bring the spec to other carriers in the coming months, though it declines to say which. But its hands are tied. RCS, unlike the messaging technologies behind internet-based clients like Facebook Messenger, requires support at the cellphone carrier level, and the uptake has been slow: only 49 carriers worldwide have adopted RCS since its debut in 2007. (A notable holdout in the U.S. is Verizon, the nation’s largest cellular provider.) Worse yet, fragmentation is beginning to emerge: many of those carriers are on an older version of RCS that’s only partial compatibility with the flavor that Sprint and others plan to implement. Related: Google aims to beef up text messages with open source system And then there’s the elephant in the room: Google’s own internet-based messaging platforms, all of which eschew support for RCS in favor of older or proprietary alternatives. Google’s new Allo client, which comes pre-installed on Pixel phones, lacks robust support for cellular messaging. And Hangouts, the company’s all-in-one messaging client, has yet to implement RCS. But all the same, the search giant appears committed, at least in part, to moving toward the promised future of RCS: platform-agnostic advanced text messaging. “[Text messaging] is one of the most ubiquitous forms of communication today, used by billions of people worldwide,” Amir Sarhangi, head of Google’s RCS efforts, wrote in a blog post. “We’re excited to see this first launch of RCS come to life, providing a better carrier messaging experience for millions of people in the U.S.” Also watch: OnePlus 3 Review Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Those are the ones without the HTTPS at the beginning of its URL. Anyone looking at what you’re doing online on that site can capture all of your information, including important user names and passwords. Most of the pages desktop users load are encrypted according to Google. But it said the myriad of symbols used by most browsers can be confusing or even misleading about the sites' lack of security. So the Chrome team is launching an effort that will publicly shame nearly half of the world’s websites that don’t use strong encryption. Those sites have a few months to comply. Come January, Google will put a clear “Not Secure” warning next to thousands of popular online sites that use unencrypted HTTP connections.

A clean white minimalist speaker powered by Google Assistant (the same knowledge base central to Google Pixel), the smart device is a learning, context-capable database that offers improved listening and functionality miles ahead of the Echo Dot. GOOGLE HOME HERALDS IN THE FUTURE OF VOICE ASSISTANTS Standard to the voice assistant arsenal, Google Home can trigger music, podcasts, or radio from a simple voice command, pulling your favorite playlists from services like Spotify and Pandora. Backed by the algorithms that made Google famous, Home is also privy to a growing list of questions, ranging from calculations, to nutrition facts, to asking for help in another language. Prompted by “Ok Google,” the speaker picks up your commands using Far-field voice recognition, without worry of having to repeat a phrase because you mumbled or stuttered. Further extending the trend of digitized assistants, you can let Google Home set timers, tell you the weather, relay traffic patterns, and even create to-do lists and events. As we enter the smart home era and the Internet of Things, Google Home has include multiple smart device control and compatibility, including a Google Home app for the smartphone, useful for adjusting volume from afar. Use Home to adjust your Nest Thermostat, or play YouTube videos from your living room. Additional speakers can also be synced for interactivity across multiple rooms. Beyond it’s interaction with other devices, Home is also designed with the user in mind. Interact with the speaker’s touch-top surface (which offers volume control and push requests), and easily mute with the touch of a button. You can decide when Google Home is listening or not, and the four multi-color lights at the top of the surface indicate when it’s waiting for a command. The bottom part of the speaker is also fully customizable, with a wide variety of colors, for $20 a piece. A recent review of the voice assistant speaker on Gizmodo was positive towards Home’s ability to listen and the context driven nature of the prompts, which allow for more varied language. However, like most voice-command products, Home still takes things a little too literally; questions still need to be simple, and don’t expect it to understand everything you want it to do. Google Home is pricier than the Echo, but in comparison, its improvements outweigh the price increase. For those looking to slowly extend their smart home capabilities, this is a recommended next step.

The smart speaker that's infused with Google Assistant can be yours for $129. It's Google's direct competitor for Amazon's Echo line, which means you shouldn't expect it to ever be sold by the mega-retailer. Google Home is a US-only product for now. Aside from being able to talk to it and ask it various questions, you can also control certain smart home devices (the list of supported ones should grow in the future). The 4K Chromecast Ultra which Google announced alongside the Home speaker has started shipping today, for those who pre-ordered from the Google store. The $69 device isn't officially available in any brick and mortar stores yet. And speaking of things that aren't officially available, the Daydream View VR headset should only be out on November 10, according to Google itself. That said, some people who have pre-ordered the Daydream View are starting to receive their units, which have been shipped early. That would normally be cause for celebration, but in this case there's a problem: using the headset requires an app called Google VR Services, which simply doesn't exist on the Play Store yet. We assume that will be published on November 10, so if you do get your Daydream View early, it looks like you'll have to wait a few days before you can use it.

Minyanville Alphabet Inc: This GOOG Stock Trend Line is all that Matters By Scutify Nov 04, 2016 6:30 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others.

Buz Investors Bullish GOOG Stock Trend Line (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock has a cult following, as it should, considering that this company has created great wealth for those who identified GOOG stock as a great investment. Google stock made a new all-time high in October as shares hit $816.68, and I was expecting-and hoping for-more of a follow-through. The lack of follow-through coupled with the price action that followed, has raised some concerns with regards to the trend in Google stock. Now GOOG stock is negative on the October results, and market indices are all under selling pressure. GOOG Stock Trend Line Bearish Headwinds he market indices have been trading sideways for the last two months, but market breadth has been decisively negative, and new lows have been outpacing new highs. This deterioration of the internals began in September, and it seems like it will not end until the indices wash out and test lower levels. Google stock was trading in a tight consolidation range that was defined by two parallel lines highlighted in blue above. In October, GOOG stock broke above this channel, and this indicated that a new trending phase was set to begin. The price action quickly failed, and this failure is the cause for my concerns. Even though the selling pressure is marketwide, this pattern is still a failure, and lower prices are now expected. The 200-day moving average is the dividing line between stocks trading in a bull market versus stocks trading in a bear market. When the share price is above the moving average, it is bullish; when the share price is below the moving average, it is bearish. It is not uncommon for this moving average to act as support as it is tested from above. This would be the first place I would be looking at to find possible price support. The financial crisis in 2009 set off panic selling, and this trend line was born when Google stock finally bottomed. Google stock has never traded below this trend line, but it has tested it on many occasions. Buyers have continually supported the stock as the price tested this trend line. This line should act as support if it is tested once again, but a failure to hold this level might indicate that something more sinister is going on.

But we are also facing myriad unintended consequences, such as the likelihood of widespread technological unemployment, a near-total loss of privacy and a dramatic dependency on technology.   The most powerful companies are no longer oil and gas enterprises or banks – they are the big data, big Internet companies and platforms, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Baidu and Tencent. These players are propelled to supremely dominant positions by what I call the megashifts: a dozen or so drivers that are unfolding exponentially and in combination – amplifying each other and reaching unprecedented magnitudes.   Any organization looking to understand exponential thinking and to achieve future-readiness must have a clear picture of what these shifts mean, and what opportunities or threats may arise from them.   Megashifts are much more than paradigm shifts, which usually affect only one sphere of human activity. They arrive suddenly to transform the basis and framework of entire industries and societies. Megashifts don’t replace the status quo with a new normal, they unleash dynamic forces that reshape life as we know it. Megashifts radically reconfigure the age-old relationship between our past, present and future.   Here are some megashifts I expect in the next few years:   Digitization: Everything that can will become digital. Information and media were the first, now it’s banking and financial services, transportation and mobility, health and government, and, soon, energy. Digitization always creates abundance (witness the near-zero cost of a song on Spotify versus iTunes or CDs), which means much lower costs for consumers. Yet it also means a mad scramble for new business models because distribution or access is no longer an issue.   Mobilization: Computing is no longer at the desk – everything is becoming mobile and, soon, wearable or hearable. Computing is becoming like air: invisible, omnipresent and utterly indispensable.   Screenification is very much related to the previous two megashifts: everything that used to be physical (or printed) is now available on screens. This also means that things are becoming increasingly medialized; what used to be between people (such as conversations in foreign languages) can soon be done via a screen using free translation apps such as SayHi, Google Translate, or soon, Waverly Labs’ Pilot prototype. A true #hellven challenge – is this heaven or hell?   Disintermediation: Many middlemen are suffering because technology increasingly makes it feasible to go direct, or indeed via new middlemen such as social media platforms or telecoms and mobile operators (such as Africa’s m-pesa, which is competing directly with banks). Examples include record labels (musicians now launch their careers via YouTube), publishers and advertising (brands can increasingly tell their stories via digital and social media, i.e. without mass-media TV or print), and consumer banking where millennials increasingly use mobile platforms and apps to make payments and organize their finances.   Datafication: Much of what used to happen face to face, i.e. things that were not recorded or mediated, is now being turned into data, e.g. electronic medical records versus talking to the doctor, the connected hiking boot that tells the store it needs new shoelaces, or the grocery delivery service that tracks all its products.   Intelligization or cognification (as Wired magazine founding editor Kevin Kelly terms it): Everything that used to be dumb is now becoming connected and intelligent, such as gas pipelines, farms, cars, shipping containers, traffic lights, etc. This connectivity allows for intelligence to be derived from the aggregate output of hundreds of millions of sensors and devices – once artificial intelligence learns from this flood of data, we will have a vastly different way of reading, seeing and directing the world.   Automation: The result of smart machines will be widespread technological unemployment. Everything that can be automated will be – including science and engineering. I believe this is actually a huge opportunity rather than a threat, but we are ill-prepared for it.   Virtualization: We no longer rely only on physical things in some room or location, but on an instance in the cloud, e.g. software-defined networking instead of local routers, virtual friends such as Hello Barbie, etc.   Augmentation: Humans can increasingly use technology to augment themselves, i.e. to be omniscient, omnipotent, superhuman. Examples include my smart watch, SmartGoggles, augmented and virtual reality, intelligent digital assistants and (sooner or later) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and implants.   Anticipation: Software can now anticipate and predict our behaviour, thus changing the way maps, email and online collaboration work.   Robotization: Even many white-collar jobs will soon be done by robots. Robots are leaving their industrial cages and entering our daily lives and homes.   Dehumanization: Taking humans out of the equation by cutting a complex human task to its bare bones and giving it to machines.   Yet the most important megashift might soon be Rehumanization: Finally, are we just about to realize that our customers don’t buy technology, they buy relationships? Maybe this is the driving force behind the recent partnership on artificial intelligence to benefit people and society, initiated by Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Google.   Technology is not what we seek, it’s how we seek – and we should embrace technology but not become it.   By Gerd Leonhard Gerd Leonhard is a futurist and author of Technology vs. Humanity. www.troymedia.com Filed under: Technology Tagged With: big Internet companies, Datafication, Dehumanization, Robotization, Technological Megashifts Related Posts No related posts found Comments on this entry are closed.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Annoying Windows 10 Popups Are Back – Now Promoting Edge Browser in the Taskbar By Rafia Shaikh Posted 1 week ago 28Shares Share Tweet Submit With Microsoft ending the Windows 10 free upgrade offer, many of us believed that this was actually a good step, possibly ridding us of all the nagging self-promotional pop ups that the company put us through. Clearly, we were wrong. The Redmond software giant appears to have learned nothing from the negative user feedback that these constant pop ups provoked earlier in the year. Now, with over 40 million users leaving the company’s browsers in just last month, the company is back to its old tactics. Microsoft is luring people to its Edge browser with freebies Back in August, Windows 10 users saw pop up messages in the taskbar advertising Microsoft’s Edge browser. This happened when they were using a rival browser like Google’s Chrome or Mozilla’s Firefox. The company would suggest that Edge is faster and drains the battery slower than the other two. This actually initiated a sort of battle with Google that started actively publishing its own ads and blog posts promoting the changes that it’s introducing to “Chrome on Windows” to make it faster. Remember when I spoke about the anti-@googlechrome pop up? It's come back, here is a screenshot! #windows10 pic.twitter.com/FpOjL27srK — Rudy Huyn (@RudyHuyn) July 18, 2016 Advertisement Microsoft is back with these annoying campaigns, now reminding users to sign up for Microsoft Rewards (aka Bing Rewards) by using Microsoft Edge. The company continues its failing journey to get more users to its browser by using the same tricks that have proven to antagonize users in the past. This time, however, it doesn’t make any attacks against the other browsers, but simply lures the users in by enticing them with freebies. “Wanna earn while you browse? Get free movies and games with Microsoft Edge. See how,” reads the ads that pop out from the Microsoft Edge icon in the taskbar. Microsoft Has Had An Abysmal Smartphone Sales Tally For The Past Few Months The report first came from PCWorld, reporting that all the ad settings were turned off. Apparently, the Anniversary Update installation had reset them to default. While the company is trying to promote the new features, the attempts it makes often cross the line to be intrusive and highly annoying to users. To put these aggressive promotions in some perspective, the software maker has lost over 300 million Edge and Internet Explorer users since January. That’s a huge number of users who have chosen Chrome, Firefox and other rival browsers over Microsoft’s offering.

The latest data from Strategy Analytics shows Android has snagged a whopping 87.5 percent of the global smartphone market. This translates into 9 out of 10 smartphones worldwide using the little green droid. This is great news for those with Google shares, but isn’t so good for Apple. Their market share sagged by 5.2% over same period. Research numbers are disputable, but Strategy Analytics' findings have been further confirmed by Apple's earnings.  These highlighted 3 quarters of declining iPhone sales. The Strategy Analytics report says Apple’s iOS market share was at 12.1 percent in the 3rd calendar quarter: this is down on the 13.6 percent recorded for the same period last year. The parallels between the smartphone and PC market are eerily familiar. Apple was an early pioneer in the personal computer market, driving many early innovations. Its unstoppable momentum began to fade and slipped into reverse in the mid 90s. It wasn’t until Steve Jobs returned to the fold that Apple's fortunes recovered. Now it appears history could be repeating, except there is no Steve Jobs to ride in and turn things around. Recent iPhone launches have seen devices that resemble models from the previous year (or several years in the case of the iPhone SE). iPhone 7 innovation has been defined more by what isn’t included (the earphone socket) while other features feel like "me too” iterations of what is already available with Android. In short, innovation might vital if Apple is to regain its position at the head of the pack, but there is scant sign of it. These trends signal a worrying trend for the health of the global smartphone market.  Other mobile operating systems crafted by BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung only make up a microscopic 0.3% of the market. Many of these niche operating systems look set to vanish. This is a real shame as diversity is vital for any functioning and healthy ecosystem to thrive. It promotes innovation and innovation is king. So what has driven the relentless rise of Android? Android’s growth has happened thanks to a flood of low-cost Chinese devices offering solid quality and high-end specifications. This is compared to non-Chinese brands at a significantly lower price point. That said, the little green droid may look unbeatable now, but storm clouds are gathering. The Android market is a crowded place. There’s limited scope for differentiation and unique designs. This means that many Android manufacturers are struggling.  Google's Pixel also sees Google going head to head against the very vendors that built Android up in the first place. As tough as the smartphone market is, there’s still opportunities for quick-witted smartphone vendors. A growing gap in the world smartphone market has developed thanks to Samsung’s recall of the Note 7. That, and a growing number of iOS faithful who are holding off on the iPhone 7 upgrade, given its lack of compelling features compared to the iPhone 6. This hasn’t escaped Huawei, who launched the Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro. This is co-designed by Porsche and uses Leica-certified optics. If Huawei can get its logistics and marketing right, its could find itself well-positioned to exploit this vacuum. That said, the news isn’t dire for Apple. iOS adoption could pick up – The iPhone 7 has only been on the market since September. Apple’s next iOS device, the iPhone 8, will most likely come under intense scrutiny. Apple will need to offer something compelling and revolutionary if it's to regain lost ground.  Are you keen to hear from an expert in this field? email facebook twitter google+ linkedin Related Why learning is the work of the future 17 different types: Is this Apple's dongle bongle?

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Enable True Stereo Sound on Your Pixel XL Dallas Thomas 1 week ago How to Enable True Stereo Sound on Your Pixel XL One of the only downsides to the new Pixel XL is that Google's flagship phone does not have stereo speakers. But if Android's awesome development community has taught us anything over the years, it's that limitations like these can be bypassed with some creative software tinkering. Developer chdloc has already found a way to enable true stereo sound output on the Pixel XL by activating the earpiece as a speaker in addition to the bottom-firing one. It's similar to the setup Apple used in the iPhone 7 models, as well as the mod that enabled stereo sound on the Nexus 5, and it makes the audio experience on your Pixel XL absolutely top-notch. Don't Miss: Get Rid of Google Assistant on Your Pixel & Switch Back to Google Now Requirements rooted Pixel XL (regular Pixel not supported) Android 7.1 Nougat (future firmware versions not supported) root-enabled file browser Step 1: Download the Modified File Chdloc's stereo sound mod originally involved editing a lot of code, but I went ahead and did the legwork for you to make things as easy as possible. As a result, you'll just need to download the modified mixer_paths.xml file I created to begin. Download the modified mixer__paths.xml file Step 2: Replace Your Existing File & Reboot Next up, open your favorite root-enabled file browser, then navigate to the /system/etc/ folder. From here, long-press the existing mixer_paths.xml file, then choose "Rename" from the context menu. After that, add a ".bak" to the end of the file name, then press "OK." From here, head to your Download folder and copy the modified mixer_paths.xml file that you grabbed from Step 1. Next, head back to /system/ect/, then paste the modded file into this folder. After that, long-press the newly-copied mixer_paths.xml file, then choose "Permissions" from the menu. Make sure that the Owner category is set to "Read" and "Write," while all other categories are set to just "Read." When you're done there, reboot your phone to make the changes take effect. Step 3: Balance the Speakers When you get back up, you'll already notice that your phone is outputting sound through both speakers, but the speakers won't be balanced properly, nor will the sound be split into left and right channels. To fix this, you'll have to run two shell commands. These commands will need to be executed every time you reboot your phone, and there are two ways of doing this: First, you can simply run the commands in Terminal Emulator after each reboot, and second, you can have Tasker automatically run the commands upon device boot. Method 1: Use Terminal Emulator to Balance Them Manually If you don't own Tasker, or if you're not comfortable with the Android automation app, start by downloading a free app called Terminal Emulator. Download Terminal Emulator from the Google Play Store Open the app, then type su and hit enter. From there, tap "Grant" on the Superuser access request, then you'll be ready to send the speaker-balancing commands. Next, just copy the following commands, then paste them into Terminal Emulator one by one, hitting return after each: echo 0x210f > /sys/kernel/debug/tfa98xx-34/regs/06-AUDIO_CTR echo 0x8093 > /sys/kernel/debug/tfa98xx-34/regs/04-I2SREG # right channel only When you're done there, you'll have true stereo sound—but remember, you'll have to run these commands after each reboot to balance out your speakers. So I'd suggest copying the above commands and saving them in your favorite note-taking app. Method 2: Use Tasker to Balance Them Automatically If you already own Tasker, you can automate the process of balancing out your speakers after each reboot. To start, create a new profile, select "Event" as the trigger, then choose "System" and tap "Device boot." From here, tap your back button, then choose "New Task" when prompted. Next, add an action to this task by tapping the + button, selecting "Code," then choosing "Run Shell." Don't Miss: Tasker for Beginners: How to Get Started with Android Automation Next, copy the first command from the bullet point list below, then paste it into the Command field, and make sure to tick the box next to "Use Root." After that, add a second action, and repeat this same process with the second command. When you're done there, tap your back button once, then press the play button in the bottom-right corner. Finally, tap "Grant" on the Superuser access request, then back all the way out of Tasker to make your profile become active. echo 0x210f > /sys/kernel/debug/tfa98xx-34/regs/06-AUDIO_CTR echo 0x8093 > /sys/kernel/debug/tfa98xx-34/regs/04-I2SREG # right channel only From now on, you'll have true stereo sound with balanced speakers. The earpiece speaker plays the left channel in all media, and the bottom-firing speaker plays the right channel. With just a little bit of work, you've now turned one of the Pixel XL's biggest downsides into a real positive.

The above quotation, of course, is from the Borges story “The Library of Babel,” which famously imagines an infinite library containing every book that has ever been or ever could be written. It must, I suppose, therefore contain atlases and books of maps, though presumably not maps printed as single sheets. How did Borges feel about maps? Well, he did publish a book titled Atlas, a kind of travel book, first published in 1984 in Spanish, translated into English a year later, and written “in collaboration with María Kodama,” his second wife. It consists of 40 or so short pieces, mostly prose, though a few are poetry, describing places he’s visited around the world, along with some of the people he’s met on his travels. The titles include “The Temple of Poseidon,” “Robert Graves at Deya,” “The Desert,” and (perhaps inevitably) “The Labyrinth.” There are photographs in the book, but no maps, and in the prologue Borges writes, “Each and every man is a discoverer. He begins by discovering bitterness, saltiness, concavity, smoothness, harshness, the seven colors of the rainbow and the twenty-some letters of the alphabet; he goes on to visages, maps, animals and stars.” That strikes me as a curious order for discovering things. I’d have thought maps came well after animals and stars, though only a fool would argue with Borges. There’s also a piece in the book titled “Iceland” in which he writes, “I was, as always, in the middle of that clear haze visible to the eyes of the blind.” And if there seems to be something richly, perversely symbolic in the notion of a blind librarian, a blind cartographer raises the symbolic stakes even higher. Not that unimpaired vision is any guarantee of knowing where you are. ¤ I was walking through East Ham in London, heading for Itchycoo Park with my fellow scribe, flâneur, and chronicler of the engagingly retro and off-kilter: Travis Elborough. You might think he was a good man to have on such an expedition, being the author last year of A Walk in the Park: The Life and Times of a People’s Institution and now Atlas of Improbable Places: A Journey to the World’s Most Unusual Corners, 51 short essays on the globe’s more wayward places, with maps by Alan Horsfield. Even so, we were lost. I’d printed off a map from Google, and Elborough had his cell phone, but we kept going astray. We were never completely and utterly lost, but much of the time we weren’t quite sure where we were or where we should be. We knew where we wanted to go but, map or no map, we couldn’t always see how to get there. Consequently, we found ourselves in various dead ends, and made a series of detours that took us through terra incognita, along streets with names such as Ruskin Avenue and Byron Avenue, and eventually around Shakespeare Crescent. We told ourselves this meandering was all part of the psychogeographic process, and I don’t think we were entirely deceiving ourselves. In due course we did arrive at the entrance to the park. There was a large, potentially helpful map, but the plastic that covered it had become opaque, hazy, and impossible to see through. Borges might have understood. Itchycoo Park is simultaneously a real, an imaginary, and a contested place; there should perhaps be quotation marks around all those adjectives. Primarily, it’s the title and subject of a great 1967 psychedelic pop song by the Small Faces that has the distinction of being the first song ever to be banned by the BBC because it contained drug references. What did you do there? — I got high What did you feel there? — Well I cried But why the tears there? — I’ll tell you why — It’s all too beautiful, It’s all too beautiful It’s all too beautiful, It’s all too beautiful And later in the song Steve Marriott sings, “I feel inclined to blow my mind.” The ban therefore doesn’t seem all that surprising, although the band’s previous single, “Here Come the Nice,” which seems to be entirely about drug dealing and amphetamines, was broadcast to the youth of Britain without demur. In order to get the ban on “Itchycoo Park” lifted, the band’s management claimed it wasn’t a song about drugs at all, but about a patch of land where the band members had played as kids: as if these things were mutually exclusive. But that was enough to get the ban lifted, thereby suggesting that BBC decision-makers were even more hopelessly out of touch than previously imagined. A number of after-the-fact origin narratives have placed Itchycoo Park in various locations around London, and the itchiness has been attributed to wasps, nettles, or rose hips — the last of these especially itchy if dropped inside somebody’s shirt collar. Elborough and I were visiting Little Ilford Park, one of the prime geographical suspects: the Guardian’s “London Calling: a musical map of the city” unhesitatingly says that this is the place. It’s a long, thin finger of greenery tucked in beside the North Circular Road, a place with a designerish new adventure playground, a lot of flat open land that looked like it had once been playing fields, a shuttered sports pavilion, a rose garden, and a public toilet that was functional (but with smashed windows). What did we do there? Well we didn’t get high, nor did we find it all too beautiful. Rather, we talked about maps and territories, nostalgia and modernity: which is to say we discussed Elborough’s new book. ¤ This Atlas of Improbable Places joins a small but growing number of what we might call alternative or perhaps “indie” travel guides, maybe anti-travel guides, postmodern Baedekers for those wearied by (or too hip for) the conventional itineraries. The genre includes Unruly Spaces (2004) by Alastair Bonnett, subtitled “Lost Spaces, Secret Cities, and Other Inscrutable Geographies” and Tom Lutz’s And the Monkey Learned Nothing and Drinking Mare’s Milk on the Roof of the World, both published this year, subtitled “Dispatches from a Life in Transit” and “Wandering the Globe from Azerbaijan to Zanzibar.” (Full disclosure: Lutz, as you may well know, is the editor of LARB, and also, as you may well not know, the editor of this piece [I have no idea what he is getting at here, Ed.]). There’s also the recent Atlas Obscura (2016), “An Explorer’s Guide to the World’s Hidden Wonders” — yes, a lot of subtitling seems to be required in these matters. All these books display a fascination with ambiguous or edgy or potentially dangerous places: ruins (industrial rather than classical), deranged architectural follies, environments created by outsider artists, underground or utopian or lost cities, abandoned prisons, bunkers, theme parks, relics of the Space Age and the Cold War; examples of all these appear in Elborough’s book. He writes about some places that will be familiar to Angelenos, such as Slab City and the Hearst Castle, but he ventures much further afield to the Aral Sea tucked between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which has dried up to become the Aralkum Desert, to Wittenoom, a town in Western Australia caked in blue asbestos, that was closed down and removed from official maps, though it’s easy enough to find on Google. I was especially taken with his account of the “illicit tunnels” of Moose Jaw, Canada, which manages to join the dots between Walter Benjamin, Chinese immigrant laborers turned bootleggers, and J. G. Ballard. Inevitably, there’s some overlap in these alt-tourist volumes, though less than you might think. The Atlas Obscura, being partly crowd-sourced online, contains by far the greatest number of sites, and Elborough admits that it came as a shock, and maybe a threat, when he went into a store looking for his own book and found that volume instead; thick, lavishly illustrated with photographic images, full of bells and whistles, sidebars, directions, details, opening times, and whatnot. It’s a good book. You can understand his anxiety, but I’m sure there’s a readership for both. Elborough’s is by far the more serious, literary, and essayistic, and also the one with the better maps. ¤ This urge to travel to ever more outlying and freakish destinations is not hard to fathom. We’ve read Marc Augé’s Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity (1995), so we’re familiar with the idea that the world has become a series of homogenized, globalized, interchangeable spaces. However, as Elborough says in his introduction, claims about the growing, soul-crushing similarity of places can be overstated […] Thankfully, the world continues to be a dizzyingly diverse place. Our appetite for the unusual and the out of the ordinary has, if anything, only been heightened by new technology, the scanning and sharing of fresh information and imagery themselves a spur to further travel and post-industrialization changing the kinds of places we find intriguing, beautiful or worthy of cursory investigation. Of course this kind of cataloging involves exclusion as well as selection, creating a new canon, and possibly just a new tourist traps. I asked Elborough if he thought we were heading for some kind of subversive Grand Tour, whereby travelers no longer visit the Uffizi but instead go to look at, say, the ruins of the Teufelsberg spy station in Berlin? And ultimately how subversive is that likely to be anyway?‬‬‬ “Well,” he said, “Grand Tourers were definitely fond of a ruin, hence the presence of Venice and Rome on their itineraries, but I too wonder about just how subversive it might be. It seems to me that just as the Romantics forged a new aesthetic of beauty in the wake of industrialization, we have worked out our own criteria of interest to meet the needs of a post-industrial, digital society.” “Addison, when formulating the original idea of the sublime, wrote about the ‘agreeable horror’ of oceans — a description that could equally work for Battleship Island.” (That’s the deserted mining settlement crammed with high rise buildings, off the coast of Japan, seen at its best in the movie Skyfall.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬)‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ Elborough continued, “I do wonder sometimes if it might not be time to take a fresh look at, I don’t know, the Leaning Tower of Pisa or the Eiffel Tower, the absolutely ridiculously over-familiar, just as an exercise. Even I find myself dozing off when I hear the phrases ‘liminal’ or ‘edge lands’ these days … I am often left wondering about the ‘dead centers’ of cities, the bits that only tourists and increasingly only the very wealthy (and their poorly paid minions) really spend any time in.‬‬”‬ ¤ By now, we’d done a circuit of Little Ilford Park and the place was filling up with people. A lot of children had arrived with their teachers and were playing games. We speculated that they were doing this in a public park because so many British school playing fields had been sold off to property developers. We also noted that large areas of the park had been left to run wild, to let wild flora and fauna have their way, a convenient if dubious conflation of conservationist and cost-cutting interests. No doubt there were nettles, and very possibly wasps and rose hips in the tall grass, but we managed not to get stung. We were also there to discuss an event that he and I were doing a couple of days later, organized by Elborough, at a place in London called the Horse Hospital, advertised as “an evening of spoken word, discussion, music, performance and short films about urban spaces, London and Los Angeles, sex and food, memory and maps.” It was called with a certain inevitability — “The Map is Not the Territory.” That had me thinking of Borges again, specifically his one-paragraph story “On Exactitude in Science,” the one in which “the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it,” which of course is a variation on an idea found in Lewis Carroll’s “Sylvie and Bruno Concluded.” “‘It has never been spread out, yet,’ said Mein Herr: ‘the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.’” Here, of course the territory is the map. And the fact is I’ve always had some trouble with this notion that the map is not the territory. I don’t doubt that it’s true, but does it really need saying? Is there anybody in their right mind who would think otherwise? Well, I discover belatedly that the phrase was first used by Alfred Korzybski, a Polish-American “independent scholar” who more or less invented a field of studies called general semantics, which doesn’t have much to do with our usual understanding of semantics, and has overtones of self-help and behavioral therapy. His point, hardly a revolutionary one, is that the human perception of reality is not the same as reality itself. The brain is an intermediary, a translator, a cartographer. But that doesn’t make our perceptions irrelevant or redundant. Korzybski writes in Science and Sanity (1933): “A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.” I’m a little troubled by the notion of “correctness” in a map since it seems to me that all maps involve falsification to a greater or lesser degree, but it’s good to know that the phrase is a metaphor, not just a statement of the blindingly obvious. Well, the event went perfectly well. We talked about many things regarding London and Los Angeles, not least the London A to Z, generally a small paperback designed to be carried in the pocket while walking, as opposed to the Thomas Guide obviously designed to be used in a car. I bought a Thomas Guide the day I moved to Los Angeles over a decade ago, and have used it maybe three times. Nevertheless it sits in the back of the car, like a talisman or a security blanket, not that it makes me feel especially secure. ¤ Here’s Beryl Markham writing in West With The Night (1942), a book about her travels in what was then British East Africa, now Kenya. “A map says to you, ‘Read me carefully, follow me closely, doubt me not.’ It says, ‘I am the earth in the palm of your hand. Without me, you are alone and lost.’” Well, I wish I had her confidence. Some of us often feel especially alone and lost when we’ve got a map in the palm of our hand. It ought to tell us where we are and how to get to where we want to go, but sometimes it just doesn’t, and that can feel worse than having no map at all. When I was in Tokyo earlier this year, I always carried, and frequently consulted, a printed map, sometimes more than one. Mostly I felt as though I was carrying a superfluous and meaningless piece of paper. Sometimes, admittedly, I also consulted a superfluous and meaningless image on a cell phone screen. It rarely helped. It was some consolation that I saw many locals who seemed to be as lost as I was. They stared at the large public maps found on many Tokyo street corners, with just as much confusion as I did. Sometimes they even photographed these maps with their cell phones, so they could carry them away with them. Not that I imagine it did much good. Recently there has been further consolation from reading a section in Lutz’s And the Monkey Learned Nothing describing his own experiences in Japan. Lutz is indeed a man of the library, in fact a man with an urge to visit every country on Earth, and (just as important) write about them. Here he writes, People who saw me looking at my map came up to help. As far as I could tell, none of them knew how to read a map. They studied mine, sometimes turning it over or sideways, never able to say where we were. But they went through the motions of being helpful very cheerfully, finally made a guess, and bowing, invariably pointed in the wrong direction. There is quite a skill, it seems to me, whether you have a map or not, whether you know how to read it or not, in remaining cheerful even when you’re completely lost, and that may be the best way to end up in some improbable places. ¤ Geoff Nicholson is a novelist and nonfiction writer and a contributing editor at LARB.

(宏達電), in October hit the second-highest level so far this year, but still fell more than 12 percent from September, when the biggest revenue figure for 2016 was recorded. <a href="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=537134883&cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Market analysts attributed the sales fall to the fading effect of HTC's newly launched smartphone models in the global market. But HTC's efforts in promoting its first virtual reality headset, the HTC Vive, as well as serving as the sole contract manufacturer of Google's Pixel smartphone series lent some support to the Taiwanese firm's sales in October, analysts added. According to HTC, its consolidated sales for October stood at NT$8.17 billion (US$259 million), down 12.4 percent from the NT$9.33 billion recorded in September. October sales also fell 8.66 percent compared with a year ago. In the first 10 months of this year, HTC posted NT$64.09 billion in consolidated sales, down 38.9 percent from a year earlier, indicating that the firm faced stiff competition in the already saturated global smartphone market. Analysts said that due to a warm reception of Google's Pixel models in the global market, HTC is expected to receive more orders placed by the U.S. high-tech giant over the next few months, which could continue to serve as a driver of the Taiwanese firm's revenue momentum for the rest of the year. In addition, HTC has said that it is scheduled to unveil new smartphone models in November and would keep pushing for the sales of the HTC Vive, adding that the company is expected to benefit from the upcoming buying spree in the Christmas season. The HTC Vive is one of the company's gambits to diversify away from its core smartphone market, which is saturated and intensely competitive, in the hope of creating an additional revenue source and turning around its fortunes. The VR headset, jointly developed by HTC and U.S. video game supplier Valve, went on sale globally in April. It is equipped with tracked controllers that allow wearers to inspect objects from every angle and interact with their surroundings. In the third quarter, HTC incurred NT$1.8 billion in net loss or NT$2.18 in loss per share, marking the sixth consecutive quarter for the smartphone brand to report a net loss, but the loss was moderated from the NT$3.71 in loss per share in the second quarter and the NT$3.16 in loss per share in the first quarter. In the first nine months of this year, HTC's loss per share stood at NT$9.05. Foreign brokerages remained mixed about HTC's outlook, saying that its core smartphone business remained slow, while the company could get a boost from sales of the HTC Vive and Google's Pixel series. A U.S. brokerage has raised its target price on HTC shares to NT$68 from NT$58, while leaving an “underweight” rating unchanged. A European brokerage has maintained an “underperform” rating and a NT$79 target price on the stock. On Friday, shares of HTC fell 0.81 percent to close at NT$85.50 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

November 6, 2016 WSP Internet usage worldwide is reaching new heights. The growing demand for 4G-enabled smartphones suggests that the traditional desktop screen and keyboard setups are slowly taking a backseat. Aside from the convenience of communicating while on the move, handheld devices such as tablets and mobile phones are now designed with features that were previously limited only to desktop computers. As a result, and for the first time ever globally, internet usage on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets now has surpassed desktop. According to web analytics firm StatCounter, the Internet usage of mobile and tablet devices accounted for 51.31 percent worldwide in October, versus the 48.7 percent via desktop. The growth of Internet usage by mobile devices in India is quite substantial, accounting for 78.05 percent, the desktop at 21.18 percent, while the tablet at 0.76 percent. Meanwhile, in the United States, Internet usage by mobile phone is at 42 percent, while in the United Kingdom is at 44.4 percent, which indicates that desktop computers remain the primary mode of Internet usage. It is apparent that the exponential increase in mobile devices has drastically changed Internet’s usage patterns. With the increasing reach of handheld devices, the race is now set on making web content more mobile-friendly. “This should be a wake up call especially for small businesses, sole traders and professionals to make sure that their websites are mobile friendly. Many older websites are not,” commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO, StatCounter. “Mobile compatibility is increasingly important not just because of growing traffic but because Google favors mobile friendly websites for its mobile search results,” Cullen added, pointing out Google’s efforts in making web content more mobile-friendly. Last year, Google started using mobile compatibility as a ranking indicator of mobile searches. Starting May of this year, the search giant added updated mobile search result that augments the ranking indicator to help users find relevant webpages that are mobile-friendly. Google also introduced an online tool ‘Test My Site’ that enables users to test how well the site works across mobile and desktop platforms, as well as AMP, an Accelerated Mobile Pages Project, which is an open-source initiative that helps publishers create mobile-optimized web content that is easy to load. The increased mobile Internet usage is a significant milestone as it indicates how handheld devices have become the primary entry point to the Internet. For many decades, desktop was the conduit that connects users online. But the convenience of communicating on-the-go, anytime of the day, and with all the world’s information at everyone’s fingertips gave mobile devices technological benefits over desktop computers. These advantages along with the improvement of 4G LTE Internet speeds, faster handheld devices made thinner and lighter allowed smartphones and tablets to easily become the device of choice by many in recent years. But, desktop still plays a significant role in the digital world, and they will not be phased out anytime soon.

By Jess Bell / Published 6th November 2016 GOOGLE SICK: The boy pleaded guilty to raping his sister at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court The 14-year-old, who was just 12 at the time of the attacks, searched for incest porn before subjecting his sibling to sexual "experimentation", a court heard. He pressured his sister, then aged nine, by saying she "wouldn't be his sister anymore" if she didn't have sex with him. And when she told her mum what had happened, the twisted boy claimed she had agreed to having sex with him. Ian Fenney, prosecuting, said the boy attacked his sister when he knew they wouldn't be disturbed. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court to six charges of raping a girl under the age of 13 during the summer of 2015. Defending Gareth James said being brought before the court had "been a lesson for him". He told the court: "He does seem to have been exposed to material that was inappropriate for somebody his age and that has played a part in his offending because he has tried to enact what he saw with his sister. "This is experimentation of a sort albeit completely inappropriate." Judge Joti Bopa-Rai sentenced the teen to a 12-month referral order and a Sexual Harm Prevention Order which lasts five years. He avoided a custodial sentence because he had no previous convictions, the judge said. Celebrity rogues gallery Monday, 23rd May 2016 Here is a list of famous personalities and disgraced entertainers who have been convicted of sex crimes. 1 / 11 “This is experimentation of a sort albeit completely inappropriate” Defending Gareth James Now living in a supervised treatment unit, the boy is banned from any contact with his sister or anyone under the age of 16. Further conditions mean he is not allowed to delete his internet history as cops will regularly inspect all his electronic devices. Judge Bopa-Rai warned: "If you bump into anyone under the age of 16 then you have to walk away - you cannot associate with them. "When you come out of the treatment unit at 16 you will still have police monitoring you until the age of 19."

He’s a fine, fine player, understated and under-appreciated. As someone with no strong opinion on WBA, either positive or negative, he’s someone I’ve always enjoyed watching. No, he’s not a complete footballer, but there’s some magic in that left foot. Like a Charlie Adam you don’t want to slap.” Yes indeed. See also Snodgrass, R.

All the football Einsteins knew Leicester would not so much defend their title as let it drift away. That’s just what happens with surprise champions. As with Leeds in 1992-93 and Blackburn in 1995-96, almost all of Leicester’s problems have been away from home. Their form at the King Power Stadium has been fine, with three wins and a draw against Southampton, and most will expect them to beat West Brom today. Tony Pulis’s side drew here last season, and their innate solidity gives them a chance in any game. They are 17th in the table but a win would put them 11th - and above Leicester.

We have all the major highlights together in one place so you can quickly catch up on all that's been going on. One of the biggest highlights of the week was perhaps the launch of the Xiaomi Redmi 4; it was launched alongside the premium variant the Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime, and a budget variant, the Xiaomi Redmi 4A. If phones are not your thing, then you might be more interested in the fact that Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare - which will very likely be the top selling game of the year - is now available to buy worldwide. Wondering if you should buy the game? Check out our Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare review to help you decide.(Also see: Everything You Need to Know About Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare) Then of course, there was crazy news like the man who legally changed his name to "iPhone Sim" (Ukranian for "iPhone 7"), in order to get a free iPhone 7 that was offered by an electronics store. In case you're wondering, Sim says that he's going to keep the name even now after getting the phone; though he might change it back once he has children. That's not the craziest thing someone has done for an iPhone over the years, and his family seems to be supportive of the decision for now. Meanwhile, other than launching the new MacBook Pros, Apple has jacked up the prices of the MacBook by up to Rs. 10,000 in India, though prices for other Macs remain unchanged. (Also see: Five Best Camera Phones Under Rs. 30,000) There were also a lot of launches that took place over the last week. We saw the launch of the Huawei Mate 9, which comes with a Leica dual-lens camera, and comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, a 5.9-inch screen, and a 20-megapixel camera. It also launched the limited edition Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9, with a EUR 1,395 (roughly Rs. 1,03,000) price tag. Aside from the phones, Huawei also launched the Huawei Fit activity tracker with a heart rate monitor. Samsung also announced a phone that really stands out this week - it launched a flip phone, the Samsung W2017, which has dual full-HD displays, and is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. The premium phone's pricing has not been announced yet, but last year's version, the Samsung W2016, was sold at CNY 9,999 (roughly Rs. 98,700). At the other end of the spectrum, ZTE also launched an Android flip-phone, the ZTE CYMBAL-T, but this is strictly a budget affair, with a single 3.5-inch display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 SoC. Launched in the US market, the phone is priced at $99.95 (roughly Rs. 6,700), and available in Wal-Mart stores. Other launches this week included the Alcatel Idol 4S (Windows 10) smartphone, which is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. As the name implies, the phone runs Windows 10 Mobile. Meizu launched two phones this week, the Meizo Pro 6s with a 12-megapixel camera, and the Meizu M5, which has VoLTE support and a 13-megapixel camera. The Intex Aqua Power M with a 4350mAh battery was launched, as was the Micromax Canvas Spark 4G with VoLTE support. We also saw two new tablets launched, the Lava Ivory Pop with a 7-inch display, and voice calling support; and the iBall Slide Brace X1, with 4G voice calling support. (Also see: iPhone 8, Galaxy S8, and Other Phones to Look Forward To) Meanwhile, Samsung's terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad year continues, with the recall of 2.8 million washing machines in the US. The top of the machines can unexpectedly detach from the chassis during use, and Samsung has received nine reports of injuries, including a broken jaw. Between this and the Galaxy Note 7, well, it's going to take some courage to shop from Samsung. Railways booking platform IRCTC continues to add more partners for its online payments, and now apart from paying via netbanking, credit cards, and other wallets, users can opt to pay directly from their MobilKwik wallet while booking tatkal tickets. Google is also looking for simpler ways to get people to pay - this week it announced Google Play subscription promos, which will allow developers to entice customers with an introductory offer on subscription for a limited time. According to Google, subscriptions are the fastest growing business model on Play, with consumers spending on subscriptions increasing 10 times over the last 3 years. There was also some news that is bound to please Indian readers - Netflix is considering an offline mode, the company's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in an interview. For people in developing countries with poor Internet connectivity this could be a very helpful feature, and even for people who live in conditions with good connections, it could be useful in scenarios such as flights, where you could queue up videos for entertainment. Also, architecture and interior design platform Houzz launched in India - it now has a presence in 15 countries.s This week, in an interview Steve Ballmer, the previous CEO of Microsoft, also talked about how smartphones broke his relationship with the company's founder (and previous CEO) Bill Gates. Meanwhile, Twitter, which continues to face a lot of pressure, also lost two very senior executives in the India/ South East Asia region. India Head Rishi Jaitly announced his exit on Monday, while South East Asia and India Managing Director Parminder Singh left on Thursday. By the way, in case you were wondering, Reliance Jio and its relations with the other telcos remains in the news.This week, Airtel announced that it's providing another 7,000 points of interconnect to Reliance Jio - whether this will help interconnectivity between the networks remains to be seen, though in our experience, there are still a lot of problems when calling other networks from Jio. Airtel also said that it might bring in price drops, but will not offer Jio-like free calls. And finally, apart from the Call of Duty release, there was a lot more from the world of gaming this week. It was the end of an era, as Nintendo ended Wii U production this week, even as the curtains were lifted on Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro console, including the launch lineup of games for the beefed-up variant of the PlayStation 4. (Also see: PS4 Pro Unboxing: Here's What to Expect) Meanwhile on Friday Blizzcon kicked off, and the World of Warcraft maker had a lot to show. Some of the biggest highlights included the fact that Blizzard and Google Deepmind are going to use Starcraft II for AI research. It also revealed that it's going to bring the much-demanded Necromancer to Diablo 3 as DLC, nearly 5 years after the game initially launched. In case that wasn't enough, Blizzard also revealed that the original Diablo will be made playable in Diablo 3, as part of a free content patch for people who already bought the Reaper of Souls DLC. There will be special graphic filters to make the game pixelated and grainy just as it was in its original 1996 release.

That’s where the digital footsoldiers come in – smearing opponents, spreading disinformation and posting fake texts for ‘pocket money’ Online legions ... ‘Social media is another place where the war goes on.’ Illustration: Joe Magee Leo Benedictus Sunday 6 November 2016 09.00 EST Last modified on Sunday 6 November 2016 19.00 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger We don’t know who they are, or what their mission is. We only know that there are thousands of them out there, pretending to be us. They may be at home, or in special offices, or sitting beside you on the train. They use social media, and write blogs and comments. Some of them may visit the bottom of this article. You can hire your own troll army if you have the cash. In 2011 the PR firm Bell Pottinger told undercover journalists that they could “create and maintain third-party blogs”, and spruce up Wikipedia profiles and Google search rankings. Indeed marketing has a rich history of so-called “astroturfing”, which is laying down fake grassroots. Take Forest, “the voice and friend of the smoker”, which at least admits in nearly invisible small print that it is paid for by the tobacco industry. Now, however, manipulating social media has become part of the business of government. It may yet influence how governments are formed. Recent reports suggest that many of Donald Trump’s most fervent online supporters are not themselves Americans, but Russians being paid by their government to help him win. One told Samantha Bee that she pretends to be a housewife from Nebraska. Why she would confess it now is unexplained, but when you look around it begins to feel like everybody does it. It’s just that no two countries’ methods are the same. China The existence of the wumao dang or “50 Cent Party” is not a secret in China, but then it is hard to employ up to two million people secretly. Even the state-owned Global Times reported with approval on the practice in 2010, citing Changsha’s party office as the source of the name after it paid a team of commenters 600 yuan a month in 2004, plus half a yuan – hence “50 cent” – for each glowing post they made. Since then, paying stooges to praise your work online has become about as routine for local government in China as hiring traffic wardens. A recent study at Harvard University found that the Chinese authorities were placing 448m phony comments on the internet each year. In an analysis of 43,800 pro-regime comments, the researchers concluded that 99.3% of them were made by civil servants from a wide variety of government departments. The postings tended to come in bursts at testing times, such as during protests or party meetings. Interestingly, few of the comments qualify as trolling, in the strict sense. Rather than attacking unbelievers, they focus on swamping the doubters with a flood of positive messages, or cleverly diverting the conversation. As with any job, some practitioners are laughably bad at it. In January 2014, quartz.com found many stooges simply cutting and pasting a suggested question into an online discussion with a party secretary in Ganzhou. “It seems like taxis are far more orderly than in past years,” they all wanted to tell him. Two years before, however, Ai Weiwei interviewed an anonymous 26-year-old with very sophisticated methods. The young man, whose own family knew nothing of his work, estimated that 10-20% of the comments he saw were left by the 50 Cent Party. He described creating several identities in one forum, and structuring arguments between them so that the most authoritative voice could ultimately settle matters in the government’s favour. Another tactic was to be deliberately provocative, and thus draw public anger on to himself and away from the authorities. “Sometimes I feel like I have a split personality,” he said. “I wouldn’t say I like it or hate it. It’s just a bit more to do each day. A bit more pocket money each month, that’s all.” Estimated troops Between 300,000 and 2m people, many part-time.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Joe Magee Russia Long before Donald Trump met Twitter, Russia was famous for its troll factories – outside Russia, anyway. Allegations of covert propagandists invading chatrooms go back as far as 2003, and in 2012 the Kremlin-backed youth movement Nashi was revealed to be paying people to comment on blogs. However most of what we know now comes from a series of leaks in 2013 and 2014, most concerning a St Petersburg company called Internet Research Agency, then just “Internet Research”. It is believed to be one of several firms where trolls are trained and paid to smear Putin’s opponents both at home and internationally. Salutin' Putin: inside a Russian troll house Read more According to internal documents released by a group of hackers in 2013, Internet Research Agency employed more than 600 people across Russia, and had an implied annual budget of $10m – half of which was paid out in cash. Employees were expected to post on news articles 50 times a day. Those who wrote blogs had to maintain six Facebook accounts and publish at least three posts daily. On Twitter, they had to have at least 10 accounts, on which they would tweet 50 times. All had targets for the number of followers and the level of engagement they had to reach. Later, an investigator called Lyudmila Savchuk went undercover at the company and afterwards published her experiences. These included smearing the character of the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in the days following his murder, and promoting the theory that he was killed by his own friends, rather than by friends of Putin. “I felt the bullets between my own shoulders,” Savchuk said. “I was so upset that I almost gave myself away. But I was 007. I fulfilled my task.” When a Finnish reporter called Jessikka Aro wrote about Internet Research in 2014, she herself became the target of a frightening campaign of threats and smears. As you might expect, many Russian trolls lack a certain polish when posting in English. “I think the whole world is realizing what will be with Ukraine, and only US keep on fuck around because of their great plans are doomed to failure,” one Internet Research employee wrote on a forum. Indeed the Guardian’s own moderators have begun to notice regular clues, especially on articles about Ukraine. “We can look at the suspicious tone of certain users, combined with the date they signed up, the time they post and the subjects they post on,” says one senior moderator. “Zealous pro-separatist comments in broken English claiming to be from western counties are very common.” Estimated troops Several thousand. Favourite subjects Putin and Trump being great, the opposition being corrupt, the Nato conspiracy against Russia, the effeminacy of Barack Obama. Israel There’s been an Israeli public relations war for about as long as there’s been an Israel. In Hebrew it’s called “hasbara”, literally meaning “explanation”, and it involves trying to improve the world’s opinion of the country and its causes. Accordingly there are around 350 official Israeli online channels, covering the full range of social media. For instance, besides its well-known Twitter accounts in English, Hebrew and Arabic, the Israeli Defence Force even has its own Pinterest page, featuring photo collections with themes such as “Soldiers’ Stories” and “IDF Style”. In 2013, the Israeli government revealed that it would also recruit “covert units” however. These would be staffed by a mixture of international supporters and domestic students, whose high intelligence, low income and familiarity with social media make them generally well suited to professional trolling. “We need a unified effort to explain why we have a legal right to be here in Israel,” the Knesset member Dov Lipman told the Jerusalem Post. “That is key to defeat the movements pushing to boycott, divest and sanction Israel.” Those who signed up would get quick access to government information, and leaders of student groups would also be awarded scholarships. Sure enough, during the war in Gaza the following summer, a student group called Israel Under Fire emerged as one of many voices promoting the Israeli side of the story. “We counter Palestinian propaganda and explain the Israeli perspective,” the group’s leader, Yarden Ben-Yosef, said. “Social media is another place where the war goes on. This is another way to tell our story.” We do not know whether Israel Under Fire was itself one of these covert units, or whether Ben-Yosef got a scholarship. The group’s Facebook Page is still active today. Estimated troops Low thousands. Favourite subjects Palestinian brainwashing, friendliness of Israeli troops, justifiedness of Israeli force. Ukraine If Russia has a troll army, why shouldn’t Ukraine? With this logic, last February, the country’s new Information Policy Ministry announced the launch of its own i-army, based at i-army.org, with plans to challenge the enemy version of events on social media. “I already said more than once that we should effectively combat Russian bots and fake information,” Ukraine’s information policy minister Yuriy Stets said. “I think this project will give us many volunteers who are ready to disseminate truthful information and expose fake reports from Russia.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Joe Magee It is not clear how many Ukrainians or Ukraine supporters have yet taken up the cause. The i-army.org site itself, where volunteers can join, is certainly not very appealing to outsiders. It is a crazed and relentless jumble of unflattering stories about Russia – from details about the MH17 air crash, to doping by its athletes, to unsubstantiated allegations from the western media that Putin is a paedophile. “Do not let yourself be deceived – spread the truth!” the site says, rousingly. More obvious signs of life can be found on the i-army’s Twitter page. This is very active, with 12,800 followers, which isn’t bad, and retweets regularly runs into dozens or hundreds. Clearly some of its followers have been arguing Ukraine’s case online, but the tweets themselves are not very persuasive, offering photographs of captured Russian military hardware, dry political statements and sudden comic memes about Russia’s federal reserves, for example. The account’s wallpaper perhaps tells you everything you need to know about the Information Policy Ministry – or the “Ministry of Truth”, as some Ukrainian wags prefer. It depicts a group of noble white knights carrying the ministry’s logo into battle against, literally, an army of fantastical trolls (who rather incongruously carry the logos of RT television and Russia 24). No matter how sympathetic one might feel towards the Ukrainian cause, it is hard not to feel that this particular region of the conflict needs a lighter touch. Estimated troops A few hundred. Favourite subjects Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. UK The so-called “Twitter Troops” of the 77th Brigade were somewhat misunderstood by the media when the new army unit was created last year. In fact social media was just one example of many non-military skills that the specialist soldiers were intended to bring to the army. And in any case, the MoD informs me, it would not be a soldier’s job to launch a disinformation campaign on the battlefield, even if they had the time. You don’t hear much about JTRIG in Britain, however, and they do just this kind of thing. Indeed the very existence of the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group was a national secret until documents from Edward Snowden were published by Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Fishman in 2014. And they reveal a very busy group of people, whose work within GCHQ was intended to help everyone from the police and MI5 to the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Bank of England. Some of JTRIG’s tactics, such as hacking into websites and setting up sexual “honeypot” stings, sound more or less like conventional spying. Others were carefully designed to manipulate and deceive. In the words of the leaked document, these included “Uploading YouTube videos containing persuasive messages; establishing online aliases with Facebook and Twitter accounts, blogs and forum memberships … sending spoof emails and text messages as well as providing spoof online resources; and setting up spoof trade sites.” Some of this sounds reasonable, and frankly welcome, such as disrupting the online activities of terrorists or child abusers. Indeed, if it still exists, JTRIG seems to target specific groups or individuals, rather than trying to influence public opinion. Which groups, however, and who chooses them, might be a legitimate concern. The document mentions the English Defence League, for example, whose members were no doubt not happy to be included. For its part, GCHQ will only say that all its work is legal. Estimated troops A few dozen. Favourite subjects Sex, drugs, not travelling to Syria please. North Korea, South Korea Most North Koreans’ experience of social media is none at all, unless they have been given an illicit glimpse by a foreigner or a government official. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are all officially blocked, just in case. Domestically, there is thus no online opinion for the regime to bother about controlling. (Unless they launch their own version of Facebook, as some believe they plan to.) Across the border, however, just about all South Koreans have smartphones, KakaoTalk and the fastest internet in the world. They also have about 200 North Korean trolls to contend with, according to a report published by a South Korean think-tank, the Police Policy Institute, in 2013. In total the report estimated that North Korean agents had posted 41,373 pieces of propaganda in 2012. (That’s about one every two days per agent, which is hardly Stakhanovite.) Facebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Joe Magee Given the extreme strangeness of the regime in Pyongyang, it is easy to presume that they would not know how to talk to a sophisticated southern audience. In fact their approach, as revealed in the report, is rather clever. Instead of hammering people with outlandish and unconvincing Juche propaganda in the usual North Korean way, Pyongyang’s trolls focus on areas that are still debated in the south – such as whether to give southerners access to sites (currently blocked) that praise the northern regime. Aware that recently started accounts with little background often arouse suspicion, northern agents also tend to work behind identities stolen from real southern users. Clearly the problem has been serious enough for South Korea to react, and indeed to overreact. For years the country’s National Intelligence Service has been routinely posting messages of its own to attack those coming from the north, and at times these have allegedly strayed into attacks on South Korea’s own opposition parties. Last year the country’s former intelligence chief Won Sei-hoon was convicted of trying to influence the outcome of the 2012 presidential election in favour of the incumbent Park Geun-hye. A retrial has since been ordered, but in the original Won was alleged to be running a team of nine agents who used at least 658 Twitter identities to post many thousands of messages to discredit the north – and also, in the case of 274,800 messages, to smear President Park’s opponents, who were described as, among other things, “leftist followers of North Korea”. Estimated troops 200 (north) 9 (south). Favourite subject Whether North Korea is a) paradise b) paranoid. Turkey President Erdoğan was taught a lesson by the Gezi Park protests of 2013. Not, unfortunately, that Turks should be allowed to live more freely, but that he should take control of social media, with which they had organised themselves against him. By the end of the summer, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) had begun recruiting a team of 6,000 social media operatives. “We aim at developing a positive political language which we are teaching to our volunteers,” a party official told the Wall Street Journal at the time. “And when the opposing camp spreads disinformation about the party, we correct them with valid information, always using positive language.” But not always being open about it. When asked to name some of the people who would be correcting this misinformation, the official declined. Sadly for Erdoğan and the AKP, their new army of volunteers proved overenthusiastic and, let’s say, under-subtle. In the months that followed it became common for those who even mildly criticised the government to be showered with far from positive remarks. Often the abuse arrived in bursts, from people with not very convincing profiles, making accusations that were not only bizarre but bizarrely similar. For instance when the journalist Emre Kizilkaya criticised the government’s handling of a hostage negotiation in October, he found himself repeatedly accused of “Zionism”. At times the “AK Trolls”, as they became known, spread false stories. In July 2014, it was reported that they started a fake Twitter account supposedly from the musician Erkan Ogur, used it to tweet controversial comments about the state intelligence services, then complained about “his” tweets to the AKP authorities in Sakarya, who promptly cancelled Ogur’s forthcoming concert there. Later, Erdoğan’s own daughter Sumeyye was apparently recorded asking one of his advisers for help from “our trolls”. When recordings allegedly showing Erdoğan’s own corruption began to spread on Twitter in the spring of 2014, he simply (but not very effectively) shut Twitter down. Perhaps aware that this Putinesque farce wasn’t making the AKP more popular, the party changed tack just before the general elections last spring, launching the New Turkey Digital Office, which would henceforth dish out more conventional online propaganda. “All of our accounts will be officially announced,” spokesman Besir Atalay told the Turkish media. “Our messages will be determined at the party headquarters. None of the other accounts would be related to us, including those ones [the trolls].” Nevertheless the AKP lost its majority in the elections. Then regained it in new elections later in the year.

Robocars With Mobility on Demand, you don’t buy a car, you buy rides. That’s certainly Uber’s plan, and is a plan that makes sense for Google, Apple and other no-car companies. But even Daimler, with Car2Go/Car2Come, BMW with DriveNow and GM with Lyft plan to sell you a ride rather than a car, because it’s the more lucrative thing to do. So what does that car of the future look like? There is no one answer, because in this world, the car that is sent to pick you up is tailored to your trip. The more people traveling, the bigger the car is. If your trip does not involve a highway, it may not be a car capable of the highway. If your trip is up to a mountain cabin, it’s more like an SUV, but you never use an SUV to go get a bottle of milk the way we do today. If it’s for a cruise to the beach on a sunny day, the roof may have been removed at the depot. If it’s for an overnight trip to a country home, it may be just beds. I outlined many of these changes in this article on design changes in cars but today I will focus on the incredibly cheap and simple design of what should become the most common vehicle made, namely the car designed for a short urban trip by one person. That’s 80% of trips and around 45% of miles, so this should be a large fraction of the fleet. I predict a lot of these cars will be made every year — more than all the cars made today, even though they are used as taxis and shared among many passengers. What does it look like? Small A car for 1-2 people will be small. It will probably be around 1.5m wide, narrow enough that you can fit two in a lane, and have it park very efficiently when it has to wait. If it’s for just one person, it won’t be very long either. For two people, there will be a “face to face” configuration which is longer and an “tandem” configuration which is a bit shorter. The 2 person vehicles aren’t a lot bigger or heavier than the one person, so they might be the most common cars, since you can serve a solo rider fairly efficiently with one, even if not perfectly efficient. A car that is so narrow can’t corner very fast. A wide stance is much more stable. There are a few solutions to that, including combinations of these: The wheels bank independently, allowing the vehicle to lean like a motorcycle when in corners. This is the best solution, but it costs some money. Alternately it’s a two wheeler, which is also able to lean, but has other tricks like the LIT Motors C-1 to stay upright. It’s electric, and has all the batteries in the floor, giving it a very low center of gravity. (One extreme example of this is the Tango, which uses lead batteries deliberately to give it that stability.) It never goes on fast roads, so it never needs to corner very fast, and its precision robot driving assures it never corners so fast as to become unstable, and it plans its route accordingly. Not super aerodynamic The car already has a big win when it comes to aerodynamic drag by only being half-width. The non-highway version probably gives back a bit of that because you don’t need to worry as much about that if you are not going fast. Energy lost to drag goes up with the square of velocity. So a 30mph car has 1/4 the drag of a 60mph car, and 1/8th the drag of a similar car of full width. The highway car needs to be shaped as close to a “teardrop” as you can, but the city car can get away with being a bit taller for more comfortable seating and entry/exit. The most efficient and safest design would be a teardrop with a backwards-facing passenger, but many people don’t like facing backwards. Though in a forward crash it’s the best direction to face. Electric powertrain You don’t care about the powertrain in your taxi, but the fleet manager cares, and various reasons suggest electric might be the way here, especially for the city car. Public policy may also push in that direction, for zero tailpipe emissions and lower overall emissions in non-coal areas. The main disadvantage is the downtime of the vehicle during recharge. That’s not an issue for you as the passenger; you never see that. You can answer it by having more cars, battery swap or occasional supercharge sessions during the day. The electric powertrain is super simple compared to today’s cars. This future car has just a tiny number of moving parts compared to any gasoline car. It’s easier for innovators to build and experiment with and easier to maintain. It has all the torque you need (you don’t need much) and regenerates energy in city driving. It stuffs all the weight into the floor of the car for stability and is quiet and smooth. As battery prices drop, it becomes very hard to beat once you remove the range anxiety and recharge anxiety questions, as a taxi inherently does. (You don’t get sent a taxi without the range for your desired trip.) Much, much simpler (and cheaper) Just as the electric powertrain has vastly fewer parts than the ICE powertrain, this car also is much simpler. While there will be cheap versions and luxury versions, many of the things we see in cars today vanish. For a short urban trip, a “box on wheels with a chair in it” is not a bad description of what you actually want. The body Some customers are still going to want some style, of course, but the bodies will be simple. Possibly just one door — the car parks in a way that your door is pointing the right direction. If it’s for tourism, a big wide windshield might still be present, but otherwise it’s easier and safer to have a segmented window. (You do need a 2nd emergency exit, some panel that can be kicked out.) If it’s a LIDAR car it doesn’t need full headlights, just LED running lights so other cars can see it at night. It doesn’t drive on dark rural roads, remember, only lit streets. Being electric it has no need for a grille. It probably doesn’t have a hood, because they probably unscrew the body at the depot during the rare service that electrics need. It doesn’t have a trunk either, just a place inside to put stuff. (Some vehicles will have trunks or other interior space, and will come when you say you have stuff to move with you.) It does have mounting points for robocar sensors of course, that’s the one thing that adds cost over a regular vehicle. We probably still want side windows that can come down, and locks we can control, but the windows might be simpler than they are today. The window on the side that has no door is probably easier to build. Unlike a human driven car, however, these windows will legally be able to tint. LCD variable tint might be a nice luxury feature. No side-view mirrors, of course, and no rear-view mirror either. But that’s inside. Safety It does have to be crash-worthy, of course, and in spite of intuitions it is possible to do that on smaller cars, it just costs money and weight to create the crumple zones and other structures, plus the airbags. A robocar has some special abilities when an accident is inevitable, to turn the vehicle if it can to direct the impact through the crumple zones and to position you well for the airbag. (It’s not out of the question a car could even spin itself to make you take the impact backwards, if the tires can offer that sort of force.) In time, as more cars on the road become robocars and accidents become more rare, we might see a reduction in the amount of weight that has to be devoted to passive crash protection. With no steering wheel, there is more room to absorb energy into a bigger airbag if you are thrown forward, and bags can be triggered even slightly before impact. The interior The seat can be spartan or luxurious, but it may not need to move around as much. If you’re alone in the car it would be fixed at maximum legroom. Luxury vehicles will have motorized recline or other adjustments as they do today, but since the trips are short, fancy features like lumbar supporters and massage are less important. Armrests might be fixed. You’ll want places to put things, particularly cupholders for drinks and charging stations for your devices, and a convenient place, probably at your feet, to put your bags. There will be a fold-out table, and also a fold-down screen. For security reasons, it should not offer a keyboard or mouse that you would connect to your devices (that means giving control of your devices to a potentially hacked keyboard) though if it has its own small general purpose computer it could offer those. Mostly the screen would exist for use by your devices, when they want to offer you a bigger screen for work or videos. You don’t really need a glove compartment since you don’t keep things in this car, but it might want to have a small cabinet with useful supplies that people need — tissues, cloths to wipe up spills, and possibly a booklet for major failures. The dashboard The most obvious thing missing though, are the controls and the dashboard. They are almost entirely gone. You will use your own phone for entertainment and information, even to issue commands to the car. A small tablet might be found as well, showing background information and allowing control in situations where your phone is unsuitable. While it would require some standardization, it would be nice if there were a slot that could accept most phones and tablets and offer them wireless power, plus connectivity to the screen and a one-way feed of data from the car. (For security reasons, communications to the car’s driving system from your untrusted phone must be tightly constrained.) It’s possible, if new, that the car might offer a superior mobile data connection to your device, since a robocar needs its own mobile data connection and has the opportunity to have a well placed antenna and more power. On the other hand, you may still want to use your phone’s data connection as your phone will usually be newer and have a better one. There might be a pop-out control for the car in breakdown situations, such as a handlebar that pops out or a joystick that lets you move the car slowly, video-game style. It would not be for driving at speed or even human takeover in an accident situation, just a low cost device to let you do things like get the car off the road in the event of major breakdowns. Cars which go out into the country might have fancier controls to let you drive dirt roads, driveways or other unmapped spaces. Will there be a fancy sound system? Well, people will want music and video in the cars and the electric engines will be less noisy. On the other hand, quality noise cancelling headphones might offer an even better experience, aided by only a subwoofer or vibration elements in the seat. And they could even offer different audio to each person if there are multiple occupants. They will probably be cheaper than a fancy sound system, too, and can be brought by the passenger if some cases. They also can be easily upgraded. More economical cars might have none of this — no screen, a fixed seat, bring your own headphones — and still be quite suitable for many riders. You aren’t spending an hour in this thing, you’re spending 15 minutes. You will mostly spend it fiddling with your phone and care about little else. Climate We will want climate control, but robotaxis offer some interesting alternatives. While heat will mostly come from the battery cooling system, it’s possible that some heat and cooling could come in a much simpler way. The car could stop by a depot for a load of ice or other pre-chilled coolant good enough to keep the vehicle cool for an hour or two. Then it would reload. With short rides, you won’t know or care how it’s done, but this could be a better choice than having an air conditioner and sucking battery power. Heat in very cold areas could also come this way, or with some GHG emissions, by burning a liquid fuel, or a biofuel. The small electric taxi may also be granted permission to go inside buildings, so you enter and leave primarily in climate controlled places, reducing its need for powerful climate control. During bitter cold periods, the cars could go to heating stations (or electric stations) to keep their interiors and batteries warm. Drive systems While this car strips out things like pedals or a steering column, it does have a few things over and above the traditional car. It needs two redundant steering systems and two redundant braking systems in particular, because the human is not there to provide alternatives if one fails. And of course it has the sensors and computers to make it drive itself. The suspension also changes. It may get more expensive in higher end vehicles as it offers a super smooth, “no feel of the road” ride to those that want it because they are no longer driving. The Big Picture This car is small and simple, much fewer moving parts and general parts than the typical car made today. It’s light and efficient and electric. Small, simple and light translates into cheap. Very cheap. As the computer/sensor pack drops down to the $1,000 range over time, and the batteries drop in price to $150/kwh, this car becomes a lot cheaper to make than traditional cars. Cheaper to make means cheaper to sell. Sold by the mile for around 25-30 cents/mile (compared to today’s cars which are around 60 cents/mile if you could buy them by the mile) this is cheaper even than a bus ticket for many rides. Billions more people will be able to access car transportation than can do so today, when you must put down many thousands of dollars to get in the game. That means big sales of these and other vehicles, which also means even lower prices. » brad's blog You should revise this Submitted by Lun Esex (not verified) on Fri, 2016-06-17 16:34. There are many things in this blog post that struck me as quite unnecessary for cars where "you aren’t spending an hour in this thing, you're spending 15 minutes." For example: "Some customers are still going to want some [body] style" (implies vehicle ownership; when you get a taxi today you don't care about its style) "There will be a fold-out table, and also a fold-down screen." (not useful for trips of only 15 minutes) "a small cabinet with useful supplies that people need" (just like taxis have now...) "the car might offer a superior mobile data connection to your device" (no chance) "Cars which go out into the country" (nah, these cars will be restricted to roads like the way shopping carts have wheel locks that prevent them from leaving the supermarket parking lot) "a subwoofer or vibration elements in the seat" (and a unicorn) "You will mostly spend [your 15 minute trip] fiddling with your phone and care about little else." This. And only this. » reply There for a reason Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-06-17 17:16. Some customers want to show up with style and will order vehicles they like.

We now have an great example of a simpler smaller lightweight vehicle on the roads....the Elio. At about $7k it's much cheaper than any available electric. Your suggestion that EV's are 'simpler' is false of course, since the number of components in an ICE is about the same (or even less) if you don't count the number of cells in a battery or components inside the ICE. Would you consider an Elio a reasonable Taxi, I certainly would not? EV counterparts will be about the same, just not up to the quality you want for a ride. Your whole hypothesis is fundamentally flawed however. The prediction that there will be a very large and varied autonomous vehicle type fleet (SUV's through to the 2 seater lightweights) available for TAAS is simple fantasy, at least for the next 15-20 years. The available business models that might be profitable for the next ten years limits you to in essence car/taxi type product, there won't be any sleeper's, boat towers, Skiing holiday SUV's, off road SUV's, but you might just get your drop down table/tray for the laptop. Even Google have now gone for a multi-passenger people mover (the FCA Pacifica)as their first real attempt at a deliverable product. » reply Part count Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-06-19 11:49. I agree if you consider each battery cell individual you have more parts in the battery pack. But I view having 1,000 of the same parts as different from 1,000 different parts. The elimination of the other ICE parts saves a lot of parts (especially moving parts) and the elimination of the dashboard saves a ton more. The most common car will be the small taxi, but you need more than that in your fleet —including traditional 4 passenger size cars. You can always serve one person with a larger car, it’s just less efficient. (Car rental companies often give you a fancier car than you reserved for that reason.) The SUVs and sleepers do not need to be many because they will be more for reserved trips than on-demand rides.

Most modern 4-6 cyl ICE have under 500 parts by the way so it's difficult to generalize on component levels. You might be better to compare reliability and maintenance costs. Most battery systems and electric motors have the advantage that they need little maintenance, so you could propose that as a benefit. However an ICE can be reconditioned when it's done too many miles, a battery typically cannot, so as they degrade they are simply scrap. EV TAAS vehicles are likely to see at least one battery swap in their usable life raising total costs. In the rest of the vehicle there simply are not enough component differences to make a difference. Elimination of the dashboard would happen whether EV or ICE if the vehicle is driverless....so I see no difference there. You might save brake pads in an EV, but you still need the hydro-mechanical brake system. You make exactly my point on business models, the likelihood is that you will see mostly 4 (or more) seater autonomous vehicles, with a large enough fleet to serve peak commute times. For non-peak times the vehicles will be just parked as manual vehicles are today, which reduces overall efficiency. You can see the initial stages today, with several 8-12 seater low speed vehicles on the market (or in late prototype stages). This trend will obviously continue, and the more of these that arrive the less attractive it is to develop 1,2 seater configurations.. Proposing lightweight vehicles will be released en-masse with huge uptake seems overly optimistic. The vast majority of vehicles on the road are 1.2k lbs and above. EV's are typically must heavier than their ICE counterparts, for example the Elio is 1.2k lbs and an eSMART about 1.7k lbs. Batteries for energy storage are very inefficient. » reply Part count Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-06-19 20:41. Correct, the simplicity that comes form the power train is independent of the simplicity that comes from things like having no dashboard, or one door, or a simpler interior. I am listing all the things that make the vehicle simpler and cheaper. Of course, one of the biggest is just being smaller. The move to electric is not assured. What is key is that many of the disadvantages of electric are eliminated for the passenger — range anxiety and recharge time anxiety. Also hunting for charging where you need to park. However, with those removed, the other disadvantages (cost and weight) still exist and I am predicting the switch based on the forecasts of $150/kwh or less for the batteries. However, simple ICE engines are also possible. In fact, they are also better off because the city cars have no need for high acceleration or power (one of electric’s advantages, actually.) But I do feel that the 1 seaters will be much cheaper to make than the 4 seaters and cheaper to run, so there will be demand for them, because a ride in one will cost less, and they also will have better ability to go through traffic — even lane splitting — and will be cheaper to store/park. And then the day will come when there will be infrastructure just for them — underpasses and elevated paths only for use by narrow, light vehicles. » reply 1-2 seater vehicles Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Tue, 2016-06-21 10:11. If driverless autonomy succeeds and shared TAAS becomes common, the most likely vehicle size would seem to be 4 seaters and above. If the fleet is sized for commute/peak then there will be lots of vehicles parked somewhere off peak. It would seem to make little economic sense to create 1-2 seaters if you have lots of 4 seaters parked. The difference in energy efficiency is unlikely to offset capitol costs. Underpasses and elevate paths seem to make no sense at all if it's just for 1-2 seaters....there would be no need or advantage for this infrastructure off peak, and the cost would appear immense. Since you are normally vehemently against any infrastructure changes to support automated vehicles, I'm surprised you'd suggest this course. » reply Narrow commuter vehicles Submitted by SingleOccupantDriver (not verified) on Tue, 2016-06-21 14:58. Assuming 4 seaters and above seating would be side by side seating: Tandem seats have the advantage to occupy less width. Vehicle width causes congestion. With the eventuality of narrow cars, government entities will tax side by side seated cars for the congestion they create. Therefore, tandem seating has enormous value added attributes over side-by-side designed cars. » reply Narrow vehicles Submitted by brad on Tue, 2016-06-21 21:14. Half-width vehicles have half the drag, and half the weight. Half-width, half-length vehicles will have even less weight. All of these mean less energy to move them and less manufacturing cost. Less weight of vehicle also makes the battery more productive in an electric vehicle. There is a virtuous circle with electric cars — make the car lighter and it needs less battery to move it, and that reduces the weight even more. » reply Buyng rides Submitted by Hunt Lee (not verified) on Wed, 2016-10-05 22:16. If people buy rides using autonomous electric car inthe future, every city has to deal with autonomous taxi company or car sharing company? If so, that can be change today's city development plan. People do not need to prepare private parking space, right? How about shopping daily goods on week day or weekends? Do people have to ride on the autonomous car to buy something to any shopping center? Can autonomous car run an errand alone to buy daily goods to shopping center for its owner or borrower? Shoppers can order their goods using their online devices and they can let their autonomous car to pick their goods up without them, I guess. If so, the building space will be changed a lot. Shopping centers can introduce kind of dive-through line for autonomous cars, instead of the traditional huge parking space. Autonomous car sharing could induce dramatic change in human life style and city development plan such as road, parking space, etc. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Conceding just before the break has really deflated them. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.11am EST 07:11 55 min: Leganes make their first change. Ramos comes in for Machis. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.10am EST 07:10 54 min: It took Real 38 minutes to have a shot on target but in the first seven minutes of the second period they have already had three. A third only seems like a matter of time. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.09am EST 07:09 52 min: Bale eyes up a free-kick from 35 yards. It is heading for the top right corner but takes a slight deflection and goes wide. The corner is given short to Marcelo and Leganes clear. Real have been excellent since the break.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.43am EST 06:43 42 min: Insua cynically rugby tackles Morata from behind as the striker broke from midfield.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.42am EST 06:42 40 min: Kroos and Nacho are both booked after the former clips Machis out wide and the latter complains that it wasn’t a foul. It was maybe a free kick but the card looks harsh. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.39am EST 06:39 GOAL! Real Madrid 1-0 Leganes (Bale) 38 min: He has been quiet up until now but the Wales star puts Real in front with the game’s first shot on target. Isco plays a sublime diagonal ball from the left that catches Leganes on the hop for the first time and Bale nips in, rounds Serantes, who did get a hand to the ball, and tucks into the open goal from a tightish angle. Updated at 6.41am EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.38am EST 06:38 37 min: Ronaldo misses the target from just outside the area, scuffing a right-footed drive to the right of Serantes’ goal. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.34am EST 06:34 33 min: Morata wins a free-kick just inside his own half and when play restarts he then commits a foul of his own. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.31am EST 06:31 30 min: Will there be a shot on target before half-time? Real have just won their first corner, so maybe. Kroos jogs over to take but it’s cleared at the near post. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.28am EST 06:28 28 min: This has been pony. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.26am EST 06:26 26 min: Gabirel almost finds Szymanowski with a neat flick in the box but the ball ends up going out of play. That’s a worry for Real, who do not look good in defence. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.25am EST 06:25 25 min: Kroos feeds Isco. He has time and space but shoots well over. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.25am EST 06:25 22 min: Ronaldo’s first chance is blown over, which is fair on Leganes because he was a yard offside. Varane found him with a long ball that evaded Insua and bounced into the social media star’s path. He chose power over accuracy and missed the target by some way. We are still waiting for a first shot on target. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.22am EST 06:22 22 min: Bustinza fouls Ronaldo just inside Leganes’s half. It’s taken quickly and the ball is worked out to the right. There, Bale picks up possession and sends a good cross towards Morata near the back stick. He tries to score from a tight angle when he may have been better off trying to head across goal. It goes onto the roof of the net. Updated at 6.22am EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.20am EST 06:20 20 min: Another awful pass from Perez, who overhits it for a goal-kick. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.19am EST 06:19 18 min: Marcelo shanks an attempted pass into the stands. More boos from the home fans, but for a different reason. This has been pretty poor from Real. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.18am EST 06:18 17 min: Boo! Hiss! Jeer! Ronaldo is booked for dissent after having a good old moan at the referee following a tackle from Perez. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.17am EST 06:17 16 min: Szymanowski goes down in the box after no contact. Play, correctly, continues. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.15am EST 06:15 14 min: Maybe it was too early for Real to have their porridge this morning … Ronaldo plays what should be a simple lateral pass behind Isco and throws his arms up in frustration. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.13am EST 06:13 13 min: Varane opts for a long ball down the right to find an advancing Carvajal but there is too much on the pass and it trickles out for a goal-kick. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.11am EST 06:11 11 min: Leganes will be happy with this. They are sitting deep and keeping it tight, meaning Real’s front three have barely had a touch. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.09am EST 06:09 9 min: Kroos’s delivery is met by Mantovani’s head. Rico follows up the hoof clear. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.08am EST 06:08 8 min: Machis is booked for tripping Marcelo from behind as the Real left back tries to attack. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.08am EST 06:08 7 min: You can tell these players are not used to playing at such an early time of day. It has been a ragged start with no clear opportunity in front of goal and far too many poor passes. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.05am EST 06:05 4 min: Carvajal, who was born in Leganes, has not started very well against his hometown club – he has given away possession cheaply twice from right back. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.03am EST 06:03 3 min: Real enjoy a spell of possession at the back but Leganes break the play up and Insua hopelessly shoots wide from silly range. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.02am EST 06:02 2 min: Not a bad start from the visitors, who attack down the left through Szymanowski before he runs out of room and gives Real a goal-kick. He will be key if Leganes are to get an unlikely result here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.01am EST 06:01 Kick-off! 1 min: Leganes get us underway, playing from right to left as we watch.

The state of play midway through Round 11: Real are top, unbeaten and on 24 points; Barça are second having suffered two defeats, with 22 points; Atlético are a further point behind having lost 2-0 at Sociedad last night, while Sevilla are behind them on goal difference. For now, though, our attention is solely on events in Madrid. Kick-off is 12pm local time (11am GMT). Confirmed team news will be along in a few moments.

Since the inception of its search engine nearly 20 years ago, Google has used the desktop version of websites to determine relevance and other ranking signals in order to populate its search index. Back in 1997, internet content consumption primarily took place on desktop and laptop computers, while mobile devices were still at least another decade away before reaching mainstream popularity. With the realization that most people search on Google using mobile devices, the company has begun experimentation with switching to a mobile-first indexing methodology. This will be of particular interest to webmasters, depending upon the configuration of the websites under their management. Google acknowledged the significance of the undertaking, and said: "We understand this is an important shift in our indexing and it’s one we take seriously. We’ll continue to carefully experiment over the coming months on a small scale and we’ll ramp up this change when we’re confident that we have a great user experience." While mobile-responsive and dynamic serving sites should not require any changes, Google has made several suggestions for sites that maintain separate markup for mobile and desktop devices. Otherwise, sites optimized only for desktop consumption will continue to be indexed as they are now. For websites that do not currently offer a mobile-optimized experience, the news may inspire webmasters to quickly build and deploy a solution. However, Google recommended a more careful approach, as "a functional desktop-oriented site can be better than a broken or incomplete mobile version of the site."         LATEST STORIES (4) Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Missile Hits Militants' Gathering in Southern Aleppo Hashd Al-Shaabi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Military Operations West of Mosul Anti-Trump Protests Continue across US Cities Spokesman: Iran's Missile Power Not Negotiable Tasting Justice: ISIL Being Driven Away in Iraq and Syria Iran, Russia Stress Boosting Mutual Cooperation Spokesman: AEOI Not Concerned About Trump Aides' Remarks Hashd Al-Shaabi Rescues 300 Sunni Families Battle for Mosul Day 28: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Mosul Operation Russia, Iran Plan $10bln Arms Deal Report: Russian Strategic Bombers Prepare to Strike Terrorists in Syria Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syria: Jeish Al-Fatah Declares State of Emergency in Aleppo Iran Urges Unity Among Muslim Nations Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army troops continued to hit the terrorist groups' defense lines and gatherings and seized back new regions in Western Ghouta, tightening the siege of the militant-held town of Khan al-Sheih.

The way we capture formal productivity data hasn’t kept up with modern ways of doing business. As a result, I believe economists underestimate productivity increases. I have since refined that conclusion: Productivity models don’t properly capture gains created by the application of new technology. Furthermore, without a revamp of Bureau of Labor Statistics’ productivity models, this distortion is going to become greater because of the latest iterations of mobile technology apps. This is important because productivity is a crucial driver of economic growth, which by conventional measures hasn’t been very impressive since the financial crisis. When studying any subject, the place to start is with facts and data. Consider the following technologies: Slack, Soundcloud and Google Docs. Slack: Using an app such as Slack to communicate with an entire company, including task-specific groups, management teams and subgroups is a big productivity enhancer. Having the ability to securely share documents and messages as opposed to emailing multiple parties is a huge benefit to any business that handles confidential material. Oh, and it’s searchable and can be archived for future audits. Soundcloud: Imagine having a 90-minute conversation with an investment firm chief, or a Nobel prize winner or a top grad school professor, then being able to share that with as many people as you can, who in turn can listen at a time of their choosing. We now take for granted that this is an ordinary thing, but it wasn’t possible without a full radio or television studio just a few years ago. Google Docs: The full suite of Microsoft tools for businesses costs $400 a year on a subscription basis for a single user. How do you capture the productivity gains of putting all of that computing horsepower in everyone’s hands at no charge, as Google has done? Or try to imagine what it would have taken in time, personnel and money to do the same things just a few short years ago. How do you measure that obvious improvement in productivity? You can probably name dozens of similarly indispensable technologies that make you, your co-workers or your employees more productive as well. Now consider the newest technologies in the sharing economy. Unproductive assets -- from spare rooms to unused equipment to parked cars -- are being transformed into revenue generators. What is the impact of Airbnb, Rent the Runway, Uber and dozens or hundreds of others on productivity and how is the Bureau of Labor Statistics capturing these gains in the formal data? Arun Sundararajan, professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business and author of “The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism,” makes the point with a few specific examples: There are 80 million power drills in the US and on average each is used just 13 minutes during its lifetime; there are 250 million cars in the country and most do nothing more than take up parking spaces or fill garages; millions of dwellings have spare rooms that sit empty; unworn clothing fills closets. The economic impact of using these assets when they normally would sit idle is potentially enormous. It isn’t hard to see that some industries, such as retail, might be hurt if more people are sharing. By the same token, manufacturing might gain if things like tools and cars are used more often and need to be replaced more frequently. We are overdue for a comprehensive overhaul of productivity models in the modern era. There really should be little doubt at this point that the way we measure productivity today, which captured the output of the economy in the last century, isn’t up to the task in this century.

NEW YORK — You can easily save hundreds of dollars on an Android phone — especially if you, like many people, don’t need a top-end camera. Cheaper Android phones are, in many respects, adequate substitutes for pricier high-end models such as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Google’s Pixel. I’m recommending three out of the handful I’ve tested: the OnePlus 3, Sony’s Xperia XA and Motorola’s Moto G4. All three are easy to use and have great battery life, enough for four or five movies on Netflix. The drawbacks? For one, availability. Only the Moto is compatible with all the major U.S. carriers. And then there’s the camera. All smartphones take decent shots in good conditions, but high-end phones typically do better in the dark. I’ll trade hundreds of dollars in savings for a camera that does well most of the time.   ONEPLUS 3 ($399) WHAT’S GOOD: You’re not sacrificing the speed or power of top-end models. The OnePlus also has a fine camera. To combat blurry shots, especially in low light, the OnePlus has an anti-shake technology that’s rare for mid-range phones. Even selfies taken at dusk turned out well. The camera’s interface is nice, too, letting you swipe up or down to change from video to photo mode. OnePlus also has a fingerprint scanner to unlock phones and a wireless chip for making payments in retail stores using Android Pay. It ran Netflix the longest among the three phones tested. WHAT’S BAD: The 5.5-inch screen is great for watching video but makes the phone too big to use comfortably one-handed. Taking a screenshot is awkward, requiring the power and volume key to be pressed simultaneously, which is harder than it sounds. Folder icons don’t show what apps are inside, making navigation difficult. The phone’s not water-resistant. DOWN THE ROAD: You can’t add storage, but it comes with a fairly generous 64 gigabytes. You don’t have as much flexibility to change carriers, as it’s not compatible with Verizon or Sprint. SONY XPERIA XA ($279) bAesthetics-wise, this light, sleek phone is my favorite. It is easy to hold and use this 5-inch phone with one hand. Taking a screenshot is simple — hold down the power key, tap the screenshot option. Folders sport mini-icons of the apps they contain. You can set an alarm clock from the home screen. The phone supports Android Pay, too. WHAT’S BAD: Its battery is the weakest of the bunch. At default settings, the phone’s display is so dark that I sometimes had to squint to look at it. It’s better once I turned off “adaptive brightness” in the settings. Photos taken in a dimly lit room didn’t turn out well. Although one swipe switches the camera from photo to video mode or from selfie to outward-facing shots, it wasn’t intuitive and took a few hours to notice. There’s also an annoying lag when switching between the modes. The Xperia lacks a fingerprint scanner and isn’t water-resistant, unlike Sony’s top-end models. DOWN THE ROAD: You can add a MicroSD card for more storage beyond the stingy 16 gigabytes offered. As with the OnePlus, it won’t work with Verizon or Sprint. MOTO G (starts at $200) WHAT’S GOOD: The phone has a textured plastic back, so it doesn’t feel as slippery. You can customize the phone’s look when you order it with different color combinations. The camera was fine, although not as good as that on the OnePlus. There’s easy access to an alarm clock on the home screen. A swipe to the right brings up your calendar, weather and news stories linked to the Google Now digital assistant; although this is standard Android, it’s missing on the other two phones. For $50 more, you can get a Plus version with a more powerful camera and a fingerprint reader (I tested the regular model). WHAT’S BAD: It is bulkier than the other phones and looks cheaper. Like the OnePlus, you need two hands for the 5.5-inch phone. Taking a screenshot is difficult, and folders don’t show the apps inside. There’s no Android Pay. Oddly, there’s also no indicator light when the phone is charging. You can flick your wrist to switch from selfie to regular camera mode, but I found this difficult to do. Getting from photo to video mode takes two taps. Though Motorola says the phone will resist spills and light rain, you can’t submerge it in water. DOWN THE ROAD: The regular G4 and Plus version both start with 16 gigabytes of storage, but you can add storage later with a MicroSD card. And hallelujah, it’s compatible with all major U.S. cellular networks.

You Google. You Uber. Are you ready to “gov?” Actor (and tech investor) Ashton Kutcher thinks so and it was a theme at the Reverb conference in Denver. by Elaine Pittman / November 3, 2016 Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper discussed the state’s “entrepreneurial energy” at the Reverb conference on Nov. 3 in Denver. Government Technology DENVER — “Google it.” “Uber home.” “Airbnb-ing.” Will government be the next noun to morph into a verb? That’s the hope and a driving force behind the Reverb conference, which brought government, tech startups and venture capitalists together Nov. 3 in Denver to discuss innovation in the public sector. RELATED 3 Reasons Some Local Governments are Eschewing Big Tech Vendors for Startups Colorado Appoints First Digital Transformation Officer Gov Tech Market Event to Dig into an Evolving Industry “These fundamental technologies have changed the actions so drastically that they have redefined the verb, because saying you’re getting a ride isn’t the same as getting an Uber,” said Ashton Kutcher, who is well known for acting but also has been investing in tech startups for more than a decade. “The essence of Reverb is really at the core of what these technologies do because when they're done right and they're done well and they're done efficiently, they change the verb, they reassign the verb,” said Kutcher. The event, hosted by the Colorado Innovation Network and Sound Ventures (Kutcher is a co-founder), focused on collaboration, partnerships and the future of public-sector IT, while also providing a venue for government tech leaders to meet directly with startups. Housed within the state’s Office of Economic Development and International Trade, the Colorado Innovation Network (COIN) has traditionally worked to spur entrepreneurialism in the state, but this year used its annual conference to change the conversation to accelerating innovation in government. Ashton Kutcher said that if the Reverb event is successful, the idea could be rolled out across the U.S. Photo by Government Technology. “Reverb was a new pilot to see if we could deeply connect our public-sector leaders with early stage companies to drive real innovation value inside of the public sector,” Erik Mitisek, the state’s chief innovation officer, told Government Technology. The one-day meeting was broken into keynote sessions and breakout tracks, while concurrently pairing startups with government representatives to discuss potential needs and opportunities. About 150 people were in attendance, with government, startups and “network leaders,” which included venture capitalists, equally represented. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper identified a need for “friendly friction” between government and tech companies to move public-sector IT forward. “In the state and, in many cases, counties and municipalities have this kind of old-fashioned approach to procurement — how do they really innovate that, how do they change that?” he asked during the morning keynote. “An event like this today can go a long way. COIN ... is all about bringing together the best and the brightest from different industries to harness that friendly friction, that innovation.” Collaboration and partnerships could be a key pairing to move the needle forward on gov tech innovation — but it’s not a new idea. "I would say that the state of Colorado has been at the forefront of working with startups,” state CIO Suma Nallapati told Government Technology. As an example, she referenced the 2013 flooding in the state and how there was an immediate need for a platform that would allow multiple entities to track incident response and recovery. “My Google team worked very closely with a company called Simply Local out of Boulder, and we stood up that website in 48 hours,” said Nallapati. “We had to have user interface design happen very quickly so we worked closely with Galvanize [a tech co-working space] and we hired a bunch of programmers on a temporary basis and gave them this project.” The site, Colorado United, is still used today, and Nallapati said it’s become a model for resilience and recovery. So what verb will innovation in government lead to? One wasn’t specifically mentioned at the conference, but Colorado’s CIO agrees that it’s only a matter of time until one rises to the surface. “We Google, we tweet, we Uber, we Airbnb,” Nallapati said. “We should come up with a great word for that, and it should be so modern and effective that people look forward to interacting with government. We are on the path toward it.” Elaine Pittman  |  Managing Editor Elaine Pittman has nearly a decade of experience in writing and editing, having started her career with The Coloradoan daily newspaper in Fort Collins, Colo.

(Photo: Blizzard.com) Google’s DeepMind AI unit, which earlier this year achieved a breakthrough in computer intelligence by creating software that beat the world’s best human player at the strategy game Go, is turning its attention to the sci-fi video game Starcraft II. The company said it had reached a deal with Blizzard Entertainment Inc., the Irvine, California-based division of Activision Blizzard, which makes the Starcraft game series, to create an interface to let artificial intelligence researchers connect machine-learning software to the game. London-based DeepMind, which Google purchased in 2014, has not said it has created software that can play Starcraft expertly — at least not yet. "We’re still a long way from being able to challenge a professional human player," DeepMind research scientist Oriol Vinyals said in a blog post Friday. But the company’s announcement shows it’s looking seriously at Starcraft as a candidate for a breakthrough in machine intelligence. Starcraft fascinates artificial intelligence researchers because it comes closer to simulating "the messiness of the real world" than games like chess or Go, Vinyals said. "An agent that can play Starcraft will need to demonstrate effective use of memory, an ability to plan over a long time and the capacity to adapt plans to new information," he said, adding that techniques required to create a machine-learning system that mastered these skills in order to play Starcraft "could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks." Virtual Mining In the game, which is played in real-time over the internet, players choose one of three character types, each of which has distinct strengths and weaknesses. Players must run an in-game economy, discovering and mining minerals and other commodities in order to conquer new territory.A successful player needs to remember large volumes of information about places they’ve scouted in the past, even when those places are not immediately observable on their screen. The player’s view of what an opposing player is doing is limited — unlike chess or Go where opponents can observe the whole board at one time. Furthermore,unlike in a game where players take turns, a machine-learning system has to deal with an environment that is constantly in flux. Starcraft in particular also requires an ability to plan both a long-term strategy and make very quick tactical decisions to stay ahead of an opponent — and designing software that is good at both types of decision-making is difficult. Facebook, Microsoft Researchers at Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have also published papers on ways to interface artificial intelligence systems with earlier versions of Starcraft. And some Starcraft-playing bots have already been created, but so far these systems have not been able to defeat talented human players. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has taken swipes at Google’s focus on games in its AI research, telling the audience at a company event in Atlanta in September that Microsoft was "not pursuing AI to beat humans at games" and that Microsoft wanted to build AI "to solve the most pressing problems of our society and economy." Games have long-served as important tests and milestones for artificial intelligence research. In the mid-1990s, International Business Machines Corp.’s supercomputer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov on several occasions. IBM’s Watson artificial intelligence beat top human players in the game show Jeopardy in 2011, an achievement that showcased IBM’s strides in natural language processing. In 2015, DeepMind developed machine learning software that taught itself how to play dozens of retro Atari games, such as Breakout, as well or better than a human. Then, in March of 2016, DeepMind’s Alpha Go program, trained in a different way, defeated Go world champion Lee Sodol. In the twenty years since Starcraft debuted, the game has acquired a massive and devoted following. More than 9.5 million copies of the original game were sold within the first decade of its release, with more than half of those being sold in Korea, where the game was especially popular. Starcraft II shattered sales records for a strategy game when it was released in 2010, selling 1.5 million copies within 48 hours. Pitting two players against one another in real-time, Starcraft was a pioneer in professional video game competitions and remains an important game in the world of e-sports, although its prominence has since been eclipsed by other games.

Don't let this happen here. Now that James Comey has dedicated the FBI to the election of Donald Trump, a remote possibility is a serious prospect. But we don't have to wonder what the first 100 days of a Trump presidency would look like. Trump has given a clear picture of what he plans, and the rest would be filled in by events beyond Trump's control. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Among things you can expect: a trade war with China and Mexico, a restarting of Iran's nuclear program, millions losing their health insurance, the start of mass deportations, a possible military standoff with China in the South China Sea and North Korea, the resumption of waterboarding, the use of federal agencies to go after Hillary Clinton and other Trump critics, the spectacle of the commander in chief suing women who have accused him of sexual misconduct and a constitutional crisis as the president of the United States attempts to disqualify the federal judge in a fraud suit against him because the judge is Latino. Oh, and the Federal Reserve would be audited, and guns would once again be allowed in schools. Trump has said that on his first day in office he will label China "a currency manipulator" — kicking off punitive tariffs. Trump said he will seek a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. Likewise, he will on his first day announce that he will renegotiate or (more likely) withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. He favors 35 percent tariffs on Mexican imports. China and Mexico, thrown into recession, will likely retaliate by blocking U.S. business from their markets. In the ensuing trade war, American consumers would be unable to purchase products they rely on, and inflation would soar. American businesses would lose hundreds of billions of dollars in exports. A Moody's report done for The Washington Post predicts a net cost to the United States of 7 million jobs. Recession would come within a year — unless further economic shocks bring about a 1930s-style depression. Trump has said he will ask Congress, also on his first day, to repeal Obamacare. This would mean the loss of health insurance for 24 million Americans, and mass chaos. At the same time, Trump would deliver a shock to labor markets: He would, on his first day, begin the deportation of more than 2 million "criminal illegal immigrants." The liberal Center for American Progress calculates this would cost $20.1 billion, and there's only enough funding currently to deport 400,000 per year. Simultaneously, Trump pledges to deliver an immediate blow to local-government finances, cutting off hundreds of millions of dollars in public safety and other funds to "sanctuary cities." U.S. universities and laboratories would be hit by Trump's pledge to cancel payments to U.N. climate-change programs, the Center for American Progress says. Huge tax cuts that Trump pledged would require either massive cuts in government spending (and resulting job loss) or a vast increase in debt. The backdrop for these economic shocks: international chaos. Many Trump early-days promises — halting immigration from terrorist-prone countries, renegotiating NATO terms and the Iran nuclear accord, pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate-change agreement — will open rifts with allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. As trade wars spread, shocks to the economy mount and allies retreat, the new president will be distracted by legal proceedings. Though "Crooked Hillary" gets the attention, a judge in New Jersey last month ruled that there is probable cause to investigate a complaint of official misconduct against Gov. Chris Christie — the head of Trump's would-be transition — because of his role in the Bridgegate scandal. Ties to Russia by two Trump loyalists are reportedly under federal examination. Trump University is facing multiple investigations and class-action suits accusing it of fraud. One such suit is scheduled to go to trial on Nov. 28 before U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel. Trump called Indiana-born Curiel "Mexican" and said the judge can't be impartial because of his ethnicity. Trump has threatened to use the power of the presidency against Curiel, much as he has threatened to use it against Clinton and the media. This is life in the early days of a Trump presidency: economic shock, international instability and constitutional crisis as Trump makes the presidency his plaything. Don't say you weren't warned.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 5, 2016 at 3:04PM There's been a lot of buzz in the tech world about virtual-, augmented-, and "mixed"-reality devices. All this talk about different digital "realities" is exciting, but it can also be confusing for investors who haven't been following these next-gen markets. Therefore, let's take a moment to review what those three markets actually consist of. Image source: Getty Images. Virtual reality Virtual reality (VR) devices immerse a user in a virtual world, which mostly blocks their view and perception of the outside world. Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that this market will grow from nearly nothing today to $30 billion by 2020. The hardware market mainly consists of tethered, mobile, and standalone devices. Tethered VR headsets, such as Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift, HTC's Vive, and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation VR, must be connected to a high-powered PC or gaming console. These devices generally offer the highest-end VR experiences and track a user's head position with optical sensors and lasers installed in "base stations" around the room. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently revealed several new tethered VR headsets that can track a user's head position by using internal sensors instead of base stations -- making it easier for multiple users to share the same physical space. Mobile VR headsets, such as Samsung's Gear VR and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cardboard, use smartphones as the "brains" of their devices. These devices are cheaper and less powerful than their tethered counterparts, but users' movements aren't restricted by wires or their proximity to a PC or console. Google Cardboard (L) and Gear VR (R). Image source: Company websites. Standalone VR headsets aren't widely available yet, but they could strike a balance between the power of tethered headsets with the convenience of mobile ones. Oculus VR's upcoming Santa Cruz headset will free the Rift from PCs for a fully wireless experience. Augmented and mixed reality Augmented reality (AR) devices project digital overlays over real-world objects. Niantic's Pokemon Go, which projects Pokemon into real-life environments with the smartphone camera, is an early example of AR gaming. Digi-Capital believes that the AR market could be worth $90 billion by 2020, thanks to the growth of AR apps on mobile devices. In the near future, depth-sensing cameras will probably accurately place digital creatures onto real-world surfaces such as tables and floors -- paving the way for all new gameplay possibilities. Google Glass was also an early attempt to "augment" a user's reality with digital information, but it flopped because of privacy concerns. Looking ahead, the most closely watched AR device is Microsoft's HoloLens, which detects surfaces and projects holographic images on top of them. Microsoft has already showcased how the device can be used for tabletop Minecraft, the creation of 3D designs, or even projecting a hologram of another person into your room. The development version of the HoloLens still costs $3,000, but it should cost a lot less when it's finally released to the general public. Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is also trying to reduce the price of these next-gen AR devices down with Project Alloy, an open-source standalone headset that also projects virtual objects onto real-world ones. That device is powered by Intel's RealSense depth-sensing camera and a sixth-generation Core processor. Mixed reality (MR) is a newer term that's often used interchangeably with AR. Headsets such as the HoloLens and Project Alloy are often called MR devices because they "mix" VR features of head and motion tracking with AR features of digital overlays on real objects. Nonetheless, they can still simply be called AR devices because they "augment" users' reality without immersing them in a "virtual" world. Watch the ecosystems and the suppliers As these markets grow, battles between ecosystems will erupt. Facebook is already expanding its Oculus Home platform on the Rift and Gear VR, Google is introducing its rival Daydream platform, and Microsoft plans to turn Windows 10 into a holographic platform for its upcoming VR headsets and HoloLens. Suppliers will also engage in fierce battles to provide the components. InvenSense, STMicroelectronics, and Bosch are battling each other to supply the gyroscopes and accelerometers that track users' movements. AMD and NVIDIA are already making gaming GPU cards much cheaper with low-end "VR ready" cards. A $120 billion market opportunity If all goes well, the combined VR and AR market might be worth about $120 billion by 2020. However, mainstream adoption could be tough if VR and AR devices are merely considered pricey toys for hardcore gamers and tech enthusiasts. Therefore, prices will need to drop and killer apps (on par with Pokemon Go) must emerge to pique the public's interest. If that happens, the VR market could become a new pillar of growth for many of the companies mentioned here.

South Korea started the e-sports industry in the early 2000s, and it continues to be a world leader in competitive gaming. There are not only professional video game players, but also broadcasting channels and professional leagues for different kinds of games. South Koreans can easily watch professional gamers playing on both television and the internet. Jungho Choi/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of From Chess to Go, board games have been the first frontier of artificial intelligence research for decades. Now, the team at Google’s DeepMind wants to take AI to a whole new level in order to beat the online strategy game, StarCraft II. DeepMind announced its decision to partner with StarCraft’s creator, Blizzard, at a conference in California. The two groups say that they look forward to programming a computer to react to strategic problems in real time. “DeepMind is on a scientific mission to push the boundaries of AI, developing programs that can learn to solve any complex problem without needing to be told how,” wrote DeepMind in a blog post. “Games are the perfect environment in which to do this, allowing us to develop and test smarter, more flexible AI algorithms quickly and efficiently, and also providing instant feedback on how we’re doing through scores.” Recommended: How well do you know hacker movies? In StarCraft, players begin the game on different sides of a virtual map, where they must discover information, build a team, and strategize to win virtual battles. The "fog of war" prevents players from seeing the whole playing area (unlike Go or chess), and this presents  a new challenge for artificial intelligence. Test your knowledge How well do you know hacker movies? Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/14 “An agent that can play StarCraft will need to demonstrate effective use of memory, an ability to plan over a long time, and the capacity to adapt plans based on new information,” writes DeepMind. Artificial intelligence has grown rapidly more sophisticated since its’ first major game breakthrough, IBM’s Deep Blue computer’s victory over chess world champion Gary Kasparov in 1997. It took AI developers 40 years to beat a chess champion. For a long time, it was unclear whether or not computers could ever develop the same “smarts” that allow chess champions to win again and again. Prior to Deep Blue’s victory, The Christian Science Monitor’s Laurent Belsie reported that: “Even though these machines are beginning to beat us at our own games, their "smarts" and mankind's intelligence are fundamentally different. Thus, the foreseeable future will not entail some apocalyptic vision of mankind versus machine. Overall, computers cannot match human wits. Instead, artificial intelligence will complement real intelligence.” Computers don’t come with “built-in common sense,” wrote Belsie. In 1997, this was true. Deep Blue eventually beat Kasparov, not because the AI was a better long-term strategist, but because it was better at calculating the best move for any given position on the board. What Google’s UK-based Deep Mind is trying to accomplish, however, is something far more sophisticated than Deep Blue’s “brute force” victory, or IBM’s Watson’s later Jeopardy trivia wins. Instead, Deep Mind wants its newest AI to remember, to strategize, and to learn. Earlier this year, Deep Mind’s AlphaGo took artificial intelligence several steps farther, beating world champion Lee Se-dol at the complex strategy game, Go. Through analyzing thousands of games, AlphaGo learned to follow patterns and strategies, eventually beating Mr. Lee. With StarCraft II, Deep Mind’s AI will have to go to a whole new level, managing a shifting game economy, gathering resources, and out-strategizing an able, human opponent. To be competitive, it will have to be able to be flexible and adaptable, ready for changed strategies at the drop of a hat. With Blizzard, Deep Mind is hoping to develop such a program. And Blizzard stands to benefit, finding new ways to improve StarCraft itself. “Is there a world where an AI can be more sophisticated, and maybe even tailored to the player?” said Blizzard’s Chris Sigaty, executive producer of StarCraft II, according to the Guardian. “Can we do coaching for an individual, based on how we teach the AI? There’s a lot of speculation on our side about what this will mean, but we’re sure it will help improve the game.” Next up Test your knowledge Passcode How well do you know hacker movies?

DeepMind is partnering with developer Blizzard to release an open research environment that better allows AIs and machine learning systems to interact with the game. Launched 20 years, StarCraft is a long-running, highly competitive franchise that continues to be played by professional gamers. The real-time strategy game involves mining resources to build new buildings and units. Players are required to make numerous decisions efficiently and quickly, while an opponent does the same. Further restrictions including not being able to see the entire combat map, but only areas within range of deployed units. AIs were able to excel in chess and Go due to the ability to see the entire board and better strategize. Decisions to send scouts blindly into the field have to be made to gain intel on your enemy. Winning requires both offensive and defensive strategies. In general, games are used to develop and test algorithms as they provide instant feedback through scores. StarCraft provides a realistic equivalent of the world’s “messiness.” AIs will learn skills that have real world applications like memory, long-term planning, and ability to adapt plans based on new information. Before AIs can being developing these skills, StarCraft II’s controls has to be adapted for a computer. A common misconception is equating speed in terms of inputting control with intelligence. Blizzard and DeepMind are currently working on having computers play within the limits of human dexterity. Particularly, coordinating mouse clicks, camera, and available resources is still challenging. So-called agents will “play directly from pixel” through a new image-based interface that outputs a simplified low resolution RGB image data for the map. The environment will be available in the first quarter of 2017 and open to all AI researchers. Additionally, Blizzard will make available game replays to provide a dataset to learn from.

I’m sad to see them go, they had amazing chemistry and gave us a filthy Tango to remember.

My highlights: Judge Rinder’s Quickstep, Ore’s Salsa shimmy, Natalie snubbing Greg on the chaise longue, Ed’s footwork, Chas & Dave, and the double prop whammy of both Strictly Lamppost and Café Table in Louise and Kevin’s Argentine. Lowlights: Daisy and Aljaz’s sugary Viennese (bleurgh), Claudia and AJ’s Pop Paso (stop it), Giovanni’s shameless limelight theft and Tess’s awful one-shouldered polyester pantsuit, which I can attest looked no better close up. Couldn’t get excited about either Danny and Oti’s Jive or Louise and Kevin’s Argentine Tango – although I’ve watched both again today on YouTube and there’s no doubt that both have partners who bring out the best in them. Also the music for both was fab-u-luss.

[READ: Video calling on WhatsApp now live for smartphones running Android and Windows] Now, WhatsApp is testing a new feature called Status and its public beta build has been made available to its Android and iOS clients, according to Mashable. The report added that the feature can be accessed by beta testers, and those who have a jailbroken iPhone or a rooted Android phone. The new feature will let users share multiple updates in a day and the status will have a lifespan of 24 hours. Available on WhatsApp's Status tab, the feature enables users to share the status with select people or with everyone in the contact list. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, has 1.6 billion monthly visitors but a study by research firm Piper Jaffray has found out a few months ago that teens prefer messaging app Snapchat to other social networking sites like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. The study published in spring this year said that 28 percent of the total 6,500 teens questioned during the research think that Snapchat in the most important social networking platform, followed by photo sharing app Instagram at 27 percent. The social media juggernaut could be trying to woo young audience by roping in a popular feature seen in Snapchat.

Likely Not Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images As this absurd election season careens to a close, any cybersecurity story with the word “Clinton” or “Trump” in the headline has become a magnet for controversy—and deserves a close fact-check. So when Slate this week reported that the Trump organization ran a secret server to communicate with a Russian bank, the story briefly blew up the Internet’s political sphere. And then the cybersecurity community rushed in to debunk it just as quickly. Political fervor and thinly reported megascoops aside, we covered other news in the cybersecurity world this week: A long-awaited exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act finally took effect on Monday that gives customers and researchers expanded ability to hack the digital components of things they own—from insulin pumps to cars. Researchers are creating tools to block a type of ultrasonic tracking used for marketing. A hacker-artist’s project turned a boring-looking printer into a rogue cell tower to intercept mobile communications. TED is working with Audible to produce audio content in which presenters are completely anonymous. And the security team for Google’s Chrome browser released new data about their initiative to pressure the web to universally adopt encrypted connections, hopefully making browsing safer for everyone in the process. And there was plenty more. Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth but that still deserve your attention. As always, click on the headlines to read the full story in each link posted. And stay safe out there. A Trump Server Secretly Communicated With Russian Bank—or Not The notion that Trump—not just Clinton!—had a politically damning secret server was perhaps a story too juicy to fully fact-check. So when Slate published a report that the Trump organization ran a server designed to covertly communicate with a Russian bank, it was taken as the strongest proof yet of Trump’s potentially corrupt Russian ties. Even the Clinton campaign trumpeted it. The Slate story was based on an anonymous cybersecurity expert’s analysis of DNS logs, the system the internet uses to translate domain names into numerical IP addresses, which seemed to show that a Trump server was communicating exclusively with the Russian bank AlfaBank. But cybersecurity consultant Rob Graham and the Intercept quickly published their own takes on the story, slicing away chunks of its credibility. The Intercept, for instance, checked IP addresses for computers on the anonymity network Tor and found that there was no evidence of an “exit node”—a computer used for rendering internet traffic tougher to trace in Tor’s system—that the Slate article had claimed AlfaBank had used. Graham showed that a domain name for the server was actually registered to the email marketing firm Cendyn. The Intercept went so far as to publish one of the marketing emails Cendyn sent on the Trump Organization’s behalf. All of that suggested Slate’s secret Russian-connected server was in fact used for something far less interesting: spam. Now the Democratic National Committee Says It Wasn’t Just Hacked—Its Headquarters May Have Been Bugged The Democratic Party recently told the FBI that it found evidence during an October security sweep of a possible listening device used to spy on its office. Democratic officials told Mother Jones that the probe had turned up a radio signal by the DNC chairman’s office, which may have been broadcasting to a device outside. The DNC did not find an actual device, and does not have evidence of who the culprits might be. A DNC official told Mother Jones, “We were told that this was something that could pick up calls from cellphones. … The guys who did the sweep said it was a strong indication.” Massive DDoS Attacks Hit Liberia’s Internet The same type of botnet that bombarded the internet infrastructure company Dyn with an internet-shaking attack last was used this week to launch the same sort of distributed denial of service against the servers of two telecom companies that own the only fiberoptic internet link in Liberia. As the companies struggled to handle 500gbps of malicious traffic (less than the 1.1 tbps attack on Dyn, but still sizable) connectivity in Liberia came in and out, and websites hosted in the country were not available externally, according to ZDNet. (Security blogger Brian Krebs, however, questioned the dubious claim that the attack had actually “shut down the internet for an entire country,” as the Hacker News had headlined the story.) The Mirai botnet used against Dyn and in this case (through a variant called Botnet 14) is open source, making it easy for anyone to access and use. Only about six percent of Liberia has internet access to begin with, and the lack of connectivity options means the country’s internet infrastructure is a relatively easy target for attack. But the incident has broad implications as hackers create even more powerful botnets and test larger and larger DDoS attacks. FBI Says It’s Investigating Its Own Twitter Account Early this week, a verified FBI account, @FBIRecordsVault, started posting about recently released political documents—including some about Donald Trump’s father Fred Trump and President Bill Clinton’s contentious Marc Rich pardon. The @FBIRecordsVault account, which hadn’t tweeted in a year, generally tweets links to documents from an FBI Records page called The Vault. But the timing of these releases seems suspect given the upcoming election and the account’s previous lack of activity. On Thursday, ThinkProgress reported that the FBI’s Inspection Division would investigate the Twitter account, given that federal law forbids the FBI from trying to influence American electoral politics. The FBI, for its part, contended in a statement that the documents were released “per the standard procedure for FOIA” and were posted automatically. Montreal Police Monitored Canadian Journalist’s iPhone Montreal police spied on Canadian journalist Patrick Lagacé’s iPhone for several months during 2016 as part of an internal police investigation into the possibility that certain gang and drug trafficking investigators were falsifying evidence. Five officers were arrested and two charged in the investigation, which turned up a connection between one of the policemen and Lagacé. The Montreal police department’s special investigations section got at least 24 surveillance warrants to monitor Lagacé’s whereabouts and incoming/outgoing communications. Lagacé says that the spying “was incredibly aggressive,” and some Canadian politicians have condemned the probe. Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre said on Monday that he supported police chief Philippe Pichet but found the situation concerning. Google Revealed a Serious Windows Bug Before Microsoft Could Patch It On Monday, Google’s Threat Analysis group disclosed a critical Windows vulnerability 10 days after initially reporting it to Microsoft. Under a 2013 Google policy, researchers only need to wait seven days before disclosing a vulnerability, but the tight turnaround made it difficult for Microsoft to ready a Windows patch. Microsoft executive vice president Terry Myerson said in a blog post on Tuesday that “Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk.” Myerson also noted that Microsoft has observed the vulnerability being exploited in spear phishing campaigns by the Russian hacking group Strontium, also known as Fancy Bear. Microsoft will release a patch on Tuesday Nov. 8, and the company says that customers using Windows 10 and the Edge browser should already be protected. Maybe Google researchers were trying to push Microsoft to patch the bug before the election. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

The researchers have just announced a new partnership with game developer Blizzard that will see the pair develop a platform to teach AI how to play StarCraft II, the immensely popular real-time strategy (RTS) title. The new project was announced at Blizzard’s own BlizzCon this weekend, and instead of focusing on DeepMind building its own AI to crush human opponents at StarCraft II, it aims to give anyone from hobbyists to scientists a way to build and train their own AI bots on how to play. Blizzard says it will be releasing an API in the coming months, allowing anyone who’s interested to participate. In a blog post announcing the partnership, Oriol Vinyals, a DeepMind researcher (and former top-ranked StarCraft player from Spain), explains why the game, one of the most competitive titles in professional gaming worldwide, was chosen for AI research: “StarCraft is an interesting testing environment for current AI research because it provides a useful bridge to the messiness of the real-world. The skills required for an agent to progress through the environment and play StarCraft well could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks.” In terms of gaming, this could lead to things like better AI for Starcraft II, improved AI player coaches, and, of course, the possibility of an AI bot that can take on even the best human players. But DeepMind hopes its research will have real-world applications too, such as in the science and energy fields. Serious StarCraft II fans need not worry just yet, however, as the researchers note they are a long ways off from developing an AI that can take on a top-ranked player.

Currently available only on Chrome Canary, ‘Chrome Home’ would relocate the address bar and tabs browser to the bottom of the screen. Pin it This move makes sense: with the address bar at the bottom of the screen, the user will no longer need to stretch their fingers all the way to the top of the screen (which matters in larger phones and tablets) to access browser options. So far Google has not made this officially available, so the only way you can try it out is to download Chrome Canary at the Playstore then type in the following in your address bar: chrome://flags/#enable-chrome-home Once the page fully loads, enable Chrome Home. After that, the app will automatically restart, and you’ll see the address bar repositioned to the bottom of the screen. Let us know if this works for you or if you’d like to keep things where they’ve always been. Pin it The feature itself isn’t perfect of course, as the relocated address bar leaves a white space at the top the page where the address bars and options used to be. However, as this feature is very much still in its early stages, the flaws will be fixed in due time. More Load More Posts © 2007‐2016 Hongkiat.com (HKDC). All Rights Reserved.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Brian Fung November 5 Follow @b_fung (Blizzard) Earlier this year, researchers' artificial intelligence beat a human in the dazzlingly complex board game known as Go. Not just once, but four times. It was a milestone in machine learning. Now, the same Google-backed researchers who designed AlphaGo have their sights set on dominating a new game: Starcraft, the classic computer strategy game that has attracted millions of fans, some of whom duel online in professional tournaments hosted by real-life sports leagues. Researchers from U.K.-based DeepMind want to train a bot that can play StarCraft II in real time — making decisions about which military units to send on scouting missions, and how to allocate resources and ultimately conquer other players. Beginning next year, the game will serve as a research platform for any AI researcher who wants to use it, potentially allowing myriad player-algorithms to train off of the same game. And joining the effort is the game's publisher, Blizzard, which is working with DeepMind to set up the platform. Unlike Go, StarCraft represents an entirely different challenge. Whereas players of the ancient board game take turns putting down stones to control physical territory, StarCraft players have to manage a constantly shifting digital economy to achieve victory. They have to mine minerals and gases, build defensive structures and offensive troops, survey the terrain and, finally, close with and engage the enemy. The best players have to know not only what's going on at their home base but also what may be happening in distant corners of the battlefield. Efficiency of motion is key; commentators talk of “actions per minute” as a way of measuring a human player's productive capacity. “StarCraft is an interesting testing environment for current AI research because it provides a useful bridge to the messiness of the real-world,” DeepMind wrote in a blog post Friday. “The skills required for an agent to progress through the environment and play StarCraft well could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks.” At this point, you may be wondering what kind of “real-world tasks” a computerized military genius might put its mind to — hopefully, that doesn't include sending siege tanks or space marines after us. The reality is that we're nowhere near to building the kind of “general” artificial intelligence that science fiction has trained us to fear. Our most sophisticated machines tend to be strong at pattern recognition but relatively weak at logic and deductive reasoning. [Everything you think you know about AI is wrong] DeepMind is not the first to think of using StarCraft as a training tool. In fact, AI researchers have spent years thinking about StarCraft precisely because of the unanswered problems for AI created by the game's open-ended style of play. And all joking aside, the implications are enormous. “Optimizing assembly line operations in factories is akin to performing build-order optimizations” in strategy games, according to one paper by an international group of researchers in 2013. “Troop positioning in military conflicts involves the same spatial and tactical reasoning used in [real-time strategy] games. Robot navigation in unknown environments requires real-time path-finding and decision making to avoid hitting obstacles.” Since at least 2011, one annual competition has pit dozens of bots against one another in games of StarCraft. And that's increasingly true of other games: Last month, developers of the turn-based strategy game “Civilization VI” unleashed eight computer players on one another to see what would happen. You can watch that here. Until a few years ago, “computer gaming” used to mean sitting down in front of a keyboard and mouse yourself. Now, it seems to mean teaching the computer to play, too. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

No fireworks from me this week, at least. Readers write to me often with many queries. Often, they just want to know how on earth I manage to find anything to write about, or curious to know where I get my information. So, todays article is about finding information that will, may, can, and does affect you. Information is all encompassing. So much out there, so little time to even begin to digest it all. Where do you start? What are you looking for? How will you know that you have what you need? Lets take a few topics that might be of interest, or relevant to your everyday life. First, where does my information come from. Everywhere. Reading! Learning! Listening! Extrapolating and anticipating changes to our way of life. I subscribe, read and have feeds from the New York Times, Bloomberg, Business Insider, the Huffington Post (US, UK, Canada, Germany), The Guardian, The Economist, The Financial Times, Google news, OECD economic reports (I am an OECD-approved journalist), Mondaq, Lexology, International Law Office, IRS Newswire, the Globe & Mail, Federal Tax Crimes, Seeking Alpha, McKinsey & Company, Wolters Kluwer Tax Blog, US Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Division, AICPA Tax Insider, KPMG and EY articles, Financial Planning Digest, Canada Revenue, Her Majestys Customs and Revenue Service (UK), the White House, US Congressional Record, Investopedia, etc, and many other peer professional blogs. Dont forget YouTube (a phenomenal source, almost always free) and Khan Academy just a truly wonderful resource, especially, if you hate reading, have a short attention span but truly enjoy videos  for learning everything from WordPress, music, maths, science, computer programming, accounting, taxes, college, economics, history, currency trading, furniture making, construction, home repairs  you name it. What should you have on your list? Well, besides fun things  everyone needs those, you should at least know about your environment and the world around you. And you are never too old to learn. Learn to defend our home. We, Bermuda residents live in a microcosmic economy surrounded by mega giants, that are always looking for esoteric reputational weapon threats to neutralise a small, albeit incredibly successful, financial centre. We, not just you, should learn everything we can about these persistent threats to our very existence, our sustenance of life. In my opinion, our economy and our island business model should be taught in every school, starting at a very young age. Our money flow through on the island just doesnt happen to circulate on hope and operating in a life the way it used to be. Not today. Everything has changed, and will continue to change in competitive global trade. To find the maximum research opportunities, you do need a computer, a smart, smart phone, or without these necessities (yes, they are expensive), you do have our trusted libraries. Search engines. I rely enormously on the infinitesimal capabilities of Google, where everything will ultimately be revealed if you are persistent and diligent. Sometimes an answer is readily not forthcoming, but rephrasing the question or broadening the search will yield many results. People search. This is easy. Lets say you have met someone, a savvy investor who wants you to invest a significant sum in a new and up-and-coming business. All appearances are that this person is genuine, honest, and has integrity, but you just want a third-party opinion. If you know the real legal name, the nationality, and the persons country of origin, the results are instantaneous. Here is an example. Say the individual sports a few of those authentic (or not) credentials, why not do some research? A few years ago, an elderly person came to me for a second opinion on a financial adviser (a CFP), who was promoting, a wonderful investment  a return of 15 per cent a year for a number of years. He was a visiting suitcase salesman who managed to conduct some business in Bermuda. We took his name, his credentials, and went on a research jaunt. A review of both the US and Canadian Certified Financial Planner Boards of Standards did not list his name. The biggest item, though, was right there on front page. Said adviser had been up on US securities fraud charges  twice. This search took all of five minutes. Enough said. Anything and everything is uploaded to the internet nowadays: licences, car registrations, property sales and purchases, marriages, deaths, consumer protection sites, medical information, educational / professional credentials, crimes, convictions, court cases, budgets, meetings, athletic races, politics (oh, how we are sick of them), travel in and out of the US, congressional records (for many countries)  the list is endless. Stocks. Just bought a Toyota car and want to know more about the manufacturing company itself. Type in Toyota stock, see the result at one of the best financial reporting resources out there. Yahoo Finance. Boy, I hope that website is maintained if Yahoo is sold! https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TM?ltr=1 You can learn even more details from focused investors, go to Seeking Alpha Toyota. http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TM Dont understand your pension annuity product. Start with a YouTube Annuity 101 series on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjxDHauOtsM Immigration. Thinking about moving abroad. Research requirements to get there for US, UK, Canada. https://www.dhs.gov/how-do-i/move-united-states https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/moving-to-the-united-kingdom http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/index.asp You are the executor of a Bermuda will.

This writer almost lost her children's birth pictures and other milestone thanks to a technical glitch. Photo: iStock Who knows whether jpegs, a common file format for photographs today, will remain the standard in, say, twenty years? mail print View all comments Tweet By Denise Lim - features@mediacorp.com.sg - Published: 6:00 PM, November 5, 2016 Updated: 12:10 AM, November 7, 2016 SINGAPORE — I heard the ominous clicking sounds and my mind raced through the thousands of treasured family photographs, stored only in digital form. I considered my children’s birth pictures, close-up shots of toothy toddler grins and puree-stained pudgy cheeks, and our outdoor family portraits. My heart skipped a beat, and I feverishly attempted to revive the external hard drive that my laptop was no longer detecting. “Not now,” I muttered. For a while, I had been meaning to print those cherished photographs. But overwhelmed by the massive backlog of files I had to wade through, I let inertia creep in. Print out important digital photographs or risk losing them forever — this was the stark headline by Google vice-president and chief Internet evangelist Dr Vinton Cerf in 2015, and the advice loomed ominously whenever I thought about my family photographs. Fortunately, I had another backup external drive, and spent intense pockets of time over the next week poring over my digital photographs. Painstakingly, I created a photo-book of my favourite pictures from the first year of my children’s lives. It was laborious, but I found myself smiling as I relived precious milestones: Their first tummy sessions, first steps, piling on weights from 2.5kg to 11.5kg in just one year — all cherished memories that would no doubt fade over time if not for photographs. THE PERILS BEHIND GOING DIGITAL When I carted my completed layout online for print, the harrowing episode had me considering the irony of the situation. I diligently save and back up my family photographs digitally, thinking that it ensures long-term survival. But is a digital version truly safer and more enduring than a physical hardcopy, for memories I hope to preserve for the next generation? Digital photos are susceptible to instant destruction, being saved on consumer devices that easily decline with moisture, dust or short circuits. And all hard disks, as we easily forget, are bound to fail eventually. A friend told me how she had wept when she discovered that her entire suite of photographs from her wedding and children’s early years was unrecoverable, due to a disk crash. I felt her pain. I remember carting about ubiquitous floppy disks and winzips to save documents in junior college and university. (I am considered a millennial, so I can’t be too ancient.) Yet the hardware needed to run those floppy disks has become relics of museums today. Mention laser discs and VHS, and you get guffaws of how clunky those things were. I have bid farewell to some of my old multimedia projects, as software has advanced so rapidly that those files cannot be opened in newer formats. Technology is progressing at an even faster rate today — who knows whether jpegs, a common file format for photographs today, will remain the standard in, say, twenty years? Armed with digital and smartphone cameras today, we tend to go trigger-happy, amassing swells of digital photographs, and consider ourselves conscientious if we back them up on hard drives or clouds as long-term solutions. It would be painfully paradoxical, then, that the most photographed generation – the inventors of the selfies and wefies – are at risk of being without pictures in decades to come, if we were to lose our softcopies due to device failure or digital obsolescence.   THE TIMELESSNESS OF PAPER “No one prints photos anymore,” a friend said matter-of-factly when we were discussing this issue. “But imagine this,” another countered. “In 2050, our grandchildren ask for photographs from their parents’ childhood, and we whip out our external drives, moaning that there is no machine that can read those plastics.” In contrast, paper records have been time-tested with papyrus scrolls having lasted centuries, and photographs, beyond decades. I have never met my Peranakan great-grandparents but know well what they look like, and their ‘serenoh’ (proper) dressing, thanks to their printed portraits that hung on my grandmother’s walls for years. Tech gurus are now figuring how to preserve and render data that can be read in centuries. Google, for one, is working on a broad platform that saves digital copies, and maintain specifications of the operating systems required to read them, so data can be re-established in future. Meanwhile, after some research, I have decided on a multi-pronged approach to preserve my family’s digital memories — including printing our most precious pictures. Back up beloved family photographs in multiple drives and media, but keep a steady eye on evolving technologies, say experts. And although the process seems arduous, it is a good idea to move files periodically from old hard disks to new ones, or even new types of media. I have set a bi-annual reminder in my smartphone for this. My ex-colleague, a tech whiz who has photographed his daughters beautifully from birth, lives by the ‘3-2-1 rule’: hold three backup copies in two different locations, including one off-site. Cloud computing, such as iCloud and Dropbox, has also emerged in recent years, and is worth considering. Still, anecdotally — among my circles at least — there seems to be some caution towards virtual storage. This could be due to costs, as well as concerns about security and privacy. “S$2,” said an attendant curtly at a neighbourhood kiosk when I enquired the cost of printing a 5R photo (what a far cry from the 30 cents I remember from years ago). But there are print packages online, as well as photo-book tools that allow you to layout as many — or as few — pictures in a page. I have also been researching the longevity of such photo-books, given these are a fairly recent invention and growing in popularity. So far, they appear viable, if one engages photo-book companies that use high-quality paper and ink meant for longevity. Some friends have used apps that pull photographs off their social media sites, printing photo-books using simple one-page layouts. This would certainly benefit those who have been sharing much of their family moments on social media, and wish to create hardcopies in a quick, fuss-free manner. My photo-book arrived in the mail that day. I heaved a small sigh of relief, because there is now a physical record of my children’s first year. I now have lofty goals to print photo-books for each phase of my children’s lives and present the collection of childhood memories to them when grow up. But let me not get ahead of myself. Only one book is complete, and I have to summon up courage to plough through many more years’ worth of images. I consider how quickly my rambunctious children grow and how photos are like time machines. These, plus lingering apprehension from that high-tech trauma, should hopefully be enough motivation.   Denise Lim is a freelance writer. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Lifestyle READ COMMENTED “I love having camera phones” “Forgive my honesty, but is there a local fashion or modelling scene in Singapore today?” ’Twas the night before Christmas ‘X’ marks the sport ‘White makes you a winner’: Thai skin whitening ad provokes race storm Why this plate of nasi lemak costs S$12.80 Which COE scheme is right for you?

It’s hardly new, and women aren’t the only victims, but certain public figures’ egregious behavior against women has recently renewed our focus – and this mom’s worries. What can we do about it? Women have always worried about harassment and assault, but it seems to me that in recent days they’re also talking about it. A lot. And that’s a good thing. Because the more we share, the more we’re aware. That’s part of the solution, I think. We need to read others’ accounts, learn and listen. Really learn to listen, and leave the “yeah, but” out of it. We need to ask questions, and we need to believe each other. Men need to believe women, not write them off as liars. They must be raised to believe them, to take them seriously as viable equals, not objects to be exploited. We parents need to speak frankly with our teenagers (within reason), even our precious boys. What on earth for? Think about it: keeping our experiences (and others’) a secret does nothing but allow such behavior to go unchecked and denies our blossoming young adults an opportunity to develop empathy and appropriate boundaries and expectations. I have the expectation that my children will be safe in this world. Some things are beyond my control, but I’m an information-is-power kind of mom. I tell my children that they have ultimate authority over their own bodies (getting them to believe this begins early in life: they control their own intake of food, for example), and encourage them to take themselves seriously, to believe themselves and to exercise their developing intuition. “How can you tell the good guys from the others, who might make bad choices?” Sometimes you can’t, but it’s easier to do if you’ve had practice tuning in to your gut from the get-go. For example, a few years ago, Holly couldn’t decide between flip-flops and sneakers.  “Which ones should I wear?” she asked, holding them up. “That’s up to you honey,” I replied, as I cleaned up the breakfast dishes. “But I can’t decide,” she moaned, staring at her naked feet. This was hardly a major life decision, but when you’re 11 and it’s your second day of middle school, shoes matter. “What does your gut say?” I asked. “My gut is broken,” she quipped. “What does your gut say?”   “Ah, but my gut won’t do you any good,” I replied, remembering that she’d commented a week earlier about how impractical flip-flops would be, since her schedule required her to hike from one end of her large school to the other and back again, and up and down busy stairwells. “I’m not the one who has to live with this decision. You know better than I do what will feel right to you.” A few minutes later I noticed she’d chosen the sneakers. It may seem like a small thing, these moments of choice, but they’re wonderful opportunities for growth. We can’t always be there to protect our children as they age – from catcalls, or worse. But we can help them to fill up their own emotional tool boxes so they’ll be better prepared to navigate their world with a healthy sense of personal authority and boundaries, even with an exercise as apparently trivial as deciding what shoes to wear. This is how developing the skill of “listening to your gut” is allowed to blossom. It’s that simple. And when apparently negative things do happen, we can help our kids to process them, calmly and without judgment. We can ask, “What about that situation felt ‘off?’” or “What did your gut tell you?” (I try not to worry about how I’ll handle these moments when they show up. I relax and let my own intuition guide me. I’m finding that the more I trust this, the more the right words – if any are needed – are there when I need them.)  When Holly arrived home that day, wearing the sneakers, she volunteered that she’d decided to get off the bus one stop early with her friend. It seems a few older boys she didn’t know were acting up. She wasn’t exactly sure what they were up to, but the situation felt “off” to her and she was certain that at that moment she didn’t want to be left alone with them, “the only girl on the bus.” She said her friend then walked her to the corner, from where Holly could see our house and her friend could still see hers. I was so proud.  “See, that’s called using your gut!” I said, “I guess it works, after all.” “My gut got fixed today,” she replied, as she turned and headed back out the door and into the world.

The London-based AI research firm and subsidiary of Google announced that the gaming company will release an API early next year allowing "researchers and hobbyists around the world to build and train their own AI agents to play StarCraft 2." "DeepMind is on a scientific mission to push the boundaries of AI, developing programs that can learn to solve any complex problem without needing to be told how," DeepMind research scientist Oriol Vinyals wrote in a blog post published Friday (4 November). "Games are the perfect environment in which to do this, allowing us to develop and test smarter, more flexible AI algorithms quickly and efficiently, and also providing instant feedback on how we're doing through scores. "StarCraft is an interesting testing environment for current AI research because it provides a useful bridge to the messiness of the real-world. The skills required for an agent to progress through the environment and play StarCraft well could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks." Since its release in 2010, StarCraft 2 has become one of the world's most popular eSports that requires tactical thinking, quick reaction time and strategic gameplay. "Players must send unites to scout unseen areas in order to gain information about their opponent, and then remember that information over a long period of time," Vinyals wrote. "This makes for an even more complex challenge as the environment becomes partially observable - an interesting contrast to perfect information games such as Chess or Go. And this is a real-time strategy game - both players are playing simultaneously, so every decision needs to be computed quickly and efficiently. "An agent that can play StarCraft will need to demonstrate effective use of memory, an ability to plan over a long time, and the capacity to adapt plans based on new information." DeepMind will work closely with the makers of StarCraft 2 to create an API featuring a new image-based interface that will allow AI to play directly from pixels and allow bots to take control of individual units. The interface will churn out "simplified" low-resolution images for the map and minimap used by the AI. An option to break down the features into different "layers" such as terrain heightfield, unit type, unit health and others will also be included. The DeepMind team is also working with Blizzard to design "curriculum" scenarios to provide increasingly complex tasks for researchers to use to "get an agent up and running, and benchmark different algorithms and advances." Researchers will also be able to create their own tasks using StarCraft 2 editing tools as well. Earlier this year, Google DeepMind's AI software AlphaGo defeated Go world champion Lee Sedol in a historic victory for AI research and development. However, DeepMind does note that it will be a while before its AI system can take on a professional human player at StarCraft 2. "While we're still a long way from being able to challenge a professional human player at the game of StarCraft II, we hope that the work we have done with Blizzard will serve as a useful testing platform for the wider AI research community," Vinyals wrote.

Full Site Menu Forget the start-up garage myth. We need golden triangles and super clusters 10 days ago / World Economic Forum LONDON - One of the most powerful myths surrounding technology entrepreneurs is that of their journeys beginning in a humble garage. The founders of Amazon, Apple, Dell, Disney, Google and Microsoft have all made this claim. Hewlett Packard really does have roots in a garage – at 367 Addison Avenue, Palo Alto. HP’s first product, the HP200A audio oscillator, was manufactured there in 1939 and used to test sound equipment. Yet, like many other entrepreneurial stories, its origins actually lay in a research university. This early hit for HP – eight were sold to Disney for its production of Fantasia – did not just magically emerge from the imagination of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard working in the latter’s Stanford garage. It can be traced back to Hewlett’s Master’s thesis at Stanford University, where he enjoyed access to cutting-edge technology, fellow enthusiasts and the guidance of legendary electrical engineer Fred Terman, one of the entrepreneurs’ lecturers. If you visit 367 Addison Avenue, a plaque marking the “birthplace of Silicon Valley” will greet you - denoting the origin of the greatest tech cluster of them all. And it is clusters, not garages, that accelerate innovation. It is clusters that bring together start-ups, established corporates, specialist and aligned businesses, and, very importantly, research-intensive universities. Steve Wozniak disavows the garage myth around Apple – perhaps a product of his co-founder Steve Jobs’ “reality distortion field”. The Homebrew Computer Club connected Jobs and Wozniak to a network of fellow enthusiasts – many with access to university computing and engineering facilities. Jobs’ course in calligraphy at Reed College inspired him to build Apple’s personal computers with beautiful typefaces and design. Time and again it is access to the brains, equipment and collaborative environment of research universities that spurs on great innovations and high-growth companies. This is seen in most of the high-growth vibrant technology clusters around the world. New York’s cluster of fast moving firms, including Buzzfeed, Foursquare and Tumblr, working at the interface of technology and media, are sucking in talent and taking advantage of collaboration with the city’s universities. In Bangalore, where the International Institute of Information Technology cultivates brilliant computer scientists, specialist firms in high tech services and outsourcing, such as InfoSys and Wipro, are clustering and growing fast. The same dynamic is at work in cities such as Berlin and Tel Aviv, and it is especially apparent in London. Such is the intensity of world-class universities, tech-savvy consumers, start-ups, availability of finance and culture, that London can more fairly be described as a ‘supercluster’, or cluster of clusters. These intense concentrations of innovation in and around universities are forging ahead in artificial intelligence, fintech, medtech, life sciences, design and fashion. Whatever the consequences for Britain post-Brexit, London is likely to continue to be a magnet for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs and tech-savvy consumers cluster in London In AI, bright young entrepreneurs such as Rob Bishop and Zehan Wang, who met as students at Imperial College London, found the community, mentorship and resources that connect academia and business. Their machine learning visual processing firm Magic Pony was recently sold to Twitter for $150 million. Bishop and Wang plan to stay in London to help develop Twitter’s global AI R&D centre. Their success came soon after Microsoft bought another London AI spinout, Swiftkey, for $250 million. The AI clusters emerging around universities in London, Oxford and Cambridge are connecting in what is being called the ‘golden triangle’. Amazon, Apple and Google have invested hundreds of millions in Cambridge and Oxford AI startups such as Evi, Vocal IQ and Deepmind.One lab, 75 companies Universities, historically the quiet heart of clusters, are playing a more active and assertive role. Harvard’s innovation lab has helped more than 75 companies get off the ground since 2011. Imperial Incubator has seen scores of spin-outs connected to Imperial College agglomerate and grow on campus. In less than a decade – from the basement rather than a garage of an academic building – Imperial Incubator firms have attracted more than $1 billion in investment. Major corporations are developing their ability to replicate and engage with the collaborative innovation of universities. In the UK, the drug company, GSK, and telecoms company, BT, are creating their own clusters, encouraging universities to engage with them. Since its 2014 launch, Microsoft Garage – there’s the word again – allows its staff to work with academic-like freedom on projects unrelated to their core roles. Staffers and student interns collaborate across the 114,000-strong workforce. Failure is encouraged, but so is rapid adoption of new features and ideas that come out of the Garage. Vastly different areas of expertise mix, just like at the best universities. Ambitious projects are nurtured. As the Microsoft Garage motto commands, “Do epic s—t”, expressing the same sentiment, if not the exact language, of great universities. Successful technology businesses can be fantastic myth-makers. Many have stories of questionable veracity, typically involving that perennial of start-up lore: the modest garage. In reality, however, their ideas frequently originate in university laboratories and lecture rooms. Those ideas turn into innovations in clusters, within which universities play vital roles, including the provision of spaces and facilities for start-ups.

(Apple) Share Written by Mike Murphy November 05, 2016 Perhaps it was the lack of ports that did it for you. Or maybe it was the removal of the MagSafe power connector. Or maybe it was the weird mini-touchscreen that replaced the function keys for an extra $300. Or maybe you just think Apple is boring now. Whatever the reason, it seems that the new MacBook Pro, announced last week, has been somewhat underwhelming critics and prospective buyers. While the computers are as well-built as any Apple product in recent memory, they seem to be needlessly minimalistic and expensive, removing all the ports, bar four USB-C ports that don’t connect to any legacy Apple products, or even the company’s newest smartphones without buying more cables. They also feature a thin touchscreen that is likely frustrating to use if you’re blind, and last year’s processors. If any of these factors are causing you to reconsider your relationship with Apple’s laptops, this guide is for you. Quartz has complied a list of Windows laptops to consider, as well as Windows programs, to replace the MacBook-shaped hole in your life. Windows laptops There was a time when Apple was really the only company that seemed to be able to pull off well-designed laptops. But in recent years, some of the largest Windows computer manufacturers have shown that they too can produce some great designs, and Windows 10, Microsoft’s latest operating system, is actually not terrible. Here’s a few computers that longtime Mac users may want to consider over the new MacBook Pro: Ones that look like MacBooks ASUS ZenBook (ASUS) The ASUS line of laptops have been getting decent reviews, and the UX303UA model looks like a slightly more angular MacBook Pro. For $900, you get a 13-inch machine with the same basic specs as the new MacBook Pros (an Intel Core i5 processor and a 256 GB solid-state hard drive) as well as decent battery life and a touchscreen. And it comes in rose gold. The UX390UA model, which ASUS is also calling the ZenBook 3, happens to look just like a MacBook, as well, except that it comes in a nifty shade of blue: (ASUS) HP EliteBook Folio. From a distance, it would be very easy to mistake this for a MacBook, were it not for the rather large HP logo just below the screen. The Verge called it a “beautifully designed laptop” (although gave it an underwhelming 6/10 review). For $1,000, you get a 128 GB solid-state hard drive and 8 GB of RAM, but you also get a touchscreen that folds down 180 degrees (for some reason), a biometric infrared eye scanner (like the one in the exploding Samsung Note 7), and a computer that is apparently drop- and dust-proof. HP Envy 13 (HP) CNET said HP’s other MacBook clone was one of computers that ushered in an era where “quality became affordable” in Windows computers. This $850 machine has the same basic specs as the EliteBook Folio, without the touchscreen. HP Spectre (HP) HP’s super-thin flagship laptop, which the company says was built with “artisan materials and striking craftsmanship,” looks rather like a MacBook designed in the 1980s: Replace the silver for black and gold, and you get the Spectre. The computer has a 13.3-inch touchscreen, a battery that can last all day, 8 GB of memory, a 256 GB solid-state hard drive, and will set you back about $1,200. Microsoft Surface Book Microsoft’s first homemade laptop got a specs refresh just last week and is definitely a different machine from the MacBook Pro, even if it looks quite similar. It features a zany bendy hinge, a detachable touchscreen, and works with a stylus so you can draw circles on the screen to your heart’s content. For $1,500, you get the pen, 8 GB of memory, and a 128 GB hard drive. There are lots of upgrade options, all the way up to a $3,200 machine with a 1 TB hard drive and 16 GB of memory, if that’s something you feel you need. Ones that look like something different Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga (Lenovo) Lenovo’s ThinkPad design, which dates back to when IBM still produced these laptops, has been around for decades. But this machine features a high-resolution 14-inch touchscreen that folds back to turn it into a tablet. It also has a fingerprint reader, and iffy battery life, according to The Verge. For $1,400, you get a 128 GB hard drive, 8 GB of memory, and that weird little red nub mouse thing that’s been on every ThinkPad computer ever. Lenovo Yoga 900 (Lenovo) Much like the other Lenovo Yoga on this list, this thin touchscreen laptop can contort itself into a tablet setup, but this one comes in a striking shade of bright orange, and doesn’t have the weird nubby mouse. For $1,150, you get a 13.3-inch screen, 8 GB of memory, and a 256 GB hard drive. (There’s also a newer 910 model that costs about $200 more for roughly the same specs and does not come in the same shade of orange, sadly.) Dell XPS 13 (Dell) Many publications, including The Verge, Wirecutter, and PC World, have called Dell’s laptop the “best” Windows computer out there. The screen is wonderfully sharp, and almost seems to bleed onto the edges of the device, as there’s almost no bezel around it. The body is a combination of aluminum and carbon fiber, and would not look out of place in a Christopher Nolan Batman film. The XPS 13 starts at a measly $800, and for that you get Intel’s newest processors, 4 GB of memory and 128 GB of storage. For $1,150, you can get the specs to match the MacBook Pro. Dude, you might be getting a Dell. Razer Blade Stealth (Razer) Gaming-computer company Razer has made some impressive laptops in recent years that are powerful enough to play some of the most processor-heavy video games on the market—something Apple has never striven to do. The Blade Stealth kind of looks like a metal version of the old plastic MacBooks, and for $1,600, you get the newest Intel chips, a 4K touchscreen, 512 GB of storage, and a whole bunch of ports. But you’d also be supporting a company that has recently made some very questionable marketing decisions. Replacements for Apple apps One of macOS’s main selling points over the years has been the suite of (relatively) simple-to-use and often free software that comes bundled with Mac computers. There aren’t direct correlations on Windows, but here are a few programs that could replicate some of the most-used Apple apps: iTunes. There aren’t a whole lot of decent music management programs out there in 2016 (and even iTunes isn’t all that great), but you can use iTunes on Windows machines if you’re sticking with your iPhone. If, however, you want a clean break from Apple, Google’s music management service, Google Play Music, is pretty great. Follow these instructions, and Google’s music manager will trawl through your computer and upload all the music on your hard drive for free, up to 50,000 songs. There’s also always Windows Media Player, but that’s never really been a great choice. Photos. Windows comes with a built-in ability to manage photos, but if you want something a bit more powerful, you can subscribe to Adobe Lightroom for $10 per month. Otherwise, again, Google offers a powerful free solution, called Google Photos. There are Android and iOS apps, as well as a website that lets you upload and catalogue every photo you’ve ever taken, and search them using regular words. You can search for your photos of “cats” or “taxi” or “food” or “France,” and it’ll find all the photos that fit that description using AI. Google Photos also allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos and videos in HD, though not the full resolution of the photo. Yahoo’s Flickr offers a similar service, with 1 TB of photo-storing space for free. iWork (Pages, Numbers, Keynote). This one should be pretty easy to replace: For office productivity software, the unsurprising choice is Microsoft Office. You can buy a home edition online for about $120, or subscribe to Office 365 for about $70 per year, which gives you access to your documents in the cloud (with 1 TB of storage), and auto-updating desktop apps. There are also far cheaper options out there, such as Google Docs, whose web apps work about 90% as well as their Microsoft or Apple counterparts. GarageBand. This is one small area where the Mac ecosystem really shines, as there aren’t many great inexpensive replacements on Windows. You could get an emulator to try to run the Mac program on a Windows computer, but I wouldn’t recommend that. If you’re just looking for a simple voice recording tool, there are options like Audacity, which works exceedingly well for what it does. For more complex projects, there’s the open-source LMMS, which is maintained by a group of engineers for free. Stagelight 3, which looks very similar to GarageBand, costs $10 for the basic software, or $50 for the full package. There’s also more professional software like Abelton Live, which ranges from $100 to over $700. iMovie. Similar to Garageband, there aren’t any direct correlations between Windows and Mac for hobbyist movie-makers. Microsoft does make a program called Movie Maker that is not wholly unlike iMovie, but a version for Windows 10 hasn’t officially been released yet. There are free options like avidemux and the VSDC video editor. If you want something with the utility of iMovie, you’re likely going to have to pay for software like Adobe Premiere, which you can purchase as part of a $20-a-month or $50-a-month subscription bundle from Adobe.
