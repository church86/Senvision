It’s large, has the killer camera and specs combo, and it’s a Pure Google device. That’s great for consumers with $899 burning a hole in their pocket, but what about the rest of us? Ambitious, bold, and aiming for the big guns in the smartphone flagship market, Google’s Pixel XL and its smaller brother, the Google Pixel, aim to give consumers the Google phone that they have always wanted but which the earlier Nexus devices may have failed to deliver.  Pixel represents a brand new chapter for Google as an end-to-end creator of consumer products. The Pixel extends the Made by Google ethos, which is to deliver high-quality devices that serve as the best containers for Google’s technology. This idea has been percolating with the expensive and premium Chromebook Pixel, the similarly costly and ambitious Pixel C 2-in-1, and now is encapsulated in the Pixel family of phones as well as in Google’s Home and Wi-Fi focused devices. Google is evolving and so is the point of access The adverts for the Pixel phones start off with a search bar which slowly morphs into the shape of a rectangle signifying a smartphone. Google understands that its services and technology are being accessed more and more via mobile devices and now it is taking full stewardship of this experience. Aside from providing a premium smartphone with what they claim to be the best camera, top tier specs, unlimited video and photo storage capability as well as the an entirely new interface running on top of Android 7.1, Google hopes to showcase its lead in A.I., that’s Artificial Intelligence, or machine learning, if you prefer. Next Level Personal Assistant This is the next level of the personal assistant. One that’s not just  proactive and smart but which can also engage in conversations with you. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the idea was for everyone to have, “their own personal Google.” Using voice as the key interface, you now have the best of Google at your disposal. Some of the cool things it can do are give you a daily briefing at the start of the day, including your schedule, the weather, and it can even play the news from sources like NPR or CNN to give you an overview of what faces you that day. If you want some tunes, you simply say, “Hey Google, can you play The Cure on YouTube,” and it will fire up the YouTube app and play “Friday I’m in Love,” by the band The Cure. It is in understanding this context and nuance that Google Assistant transcends what we’ve seen so far with technologies like Siri, Cortana and Google’s own Google Now. Other useful examples are “Ok, Google go to Huffington Post.com,” to fire up Chrome and go to that website’s mobile page. As someone who doesn’t particularly like talking to technology, I’ve only scratched the surface of what Google Assistant has to offer me, but from what I’ve seen, it is impressive and seems to be evolving, which will really help in pushing it to where it needs to go in people’s consciousness. Pixel Phone by Google  Google has always relied on HTC for making its landmark products. The very first Android smartphone was the HTC Dream (G1) and while clunky, it did provide the blueprint for all devices to come. The very first Nexus device, the Nexus One, was also an HTC/Google collaboration and set the pace for the developer-focused Nexus program which caught on big with many Android aficionados. It comes as no surprise, then, that HTC is the manufacturer of the Pixel and Pixel XL.  While Google takes full credit for the design and development of the Pixel, it was created with HTC’s expertise and I think this was an excellent choice of manufacturer. HTC has been one of the strongest Android OEM’s in terms of build quality, design and materials and this shows with their latest flagship the HTC 10 as well as the Pixel XL. It was rumoured that Chinese smartphone maker Huawei was going to make these devices, I'm glad HTC was chosen instead. Huawei's product's simply don't feel as premium or as polished as HTC's. Design and Materials Like many, I initially pooh-poohed the Pixel’s appearance as being a straight-out copy of Apple’s iPhone 6 design (which seems popular enough that Apple used it for three generations of flagships, including the iPhone 7). After having used the device for some days, I realize things aren’t as black and silver as they seem. The placement of the Pixel Imprint fingerprint sensor on the rear makes a lot more sense than where the iPhone has it at the bottom. The Pixel has chamfered edges that make it easier to grip. There’s enough Google DNA in this product that gives it its own character. Not bad a at all for a first product that had a shortened 9 month development time. In terms of build quality, The Pixel XL is very well put together and has used some neat engineering tricks to avoid having a camera bump and including a headphone jack. Slightly thicker at the top, the Pixel tapers down slightly on the sides until one bevel almost completely disappears. Its a neat trick, one that keeps the device balanced while making it look seamless and monolithic.  At first, I was bothered by the slate of glass on the rear where the Imprint fingerprint sensor lies, but I have gotten used to the look and feel of this and it does give the Pixel its own character and quality feel.  So, while it may look boring and indistinctive at first glance, there’s a lot to appreciate with the Pixel XL’s build quality and tactile feel. I like it more than Huawei’s odd Nexus 6P Design which, while premium in feel, looked like a lazy design and was one of the least attractive Nexus devices in my opinion. Functionality  The Pixel XL, which has a 5.5-inch 2K display, fits nicely in the hand although it isn’t the easiest smartphone to navigate in one hand. Taking it out of your pocket and bag makes resting a finger on the the Imprint sensor easy and quickly enables ‘waking’ the Pixel from sleep. Scrolling down from the Imprint sensor offers a neat way to peruse notifications, scrolling down persistently opens up the short-cut drawer and eventually the settings. Android 7.1 Nougat brings a new Pixel launcher with rounded icons which is minimalist yet quite intuitive. Google gets its own button (plus can be triggered by pressing the middle navigation button or triggered by voice), so it is front and centre. Aside from Google apps being pre-loaded, you also get Google Allo and Google Duo, the new text and video messaging apps from Google which takeover where Hangouts used to be. These apps are just okay, they are tied to your phone number and there's just not too many people using them yet, so they're not essential. Performance and multi-tasking is top notch. Pure Android plus the Pixel’s top of the line specs with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor (2.15 GHz + 1.6 GHz, 64-Bit Quad-Core processor) and 4GB of RAM is a combo that’s tough to beat. This means slicing through apps and in between tasks is fast and friction free. Honestly, performance on the Pixel XL is unlike anything I've tried on any Android device. The Pixel XL doesn’t have wireless charging, nor does it have stereo speakers and it also isn’t waterproof (it is rated at IP53). The Pixel XL comes in 32GB and 128 GB capacities but continues on the unfortunate trend set by Nexus devices in that it doesn’t offer microSD card expansion. The Pixel phones do offer quick charging with a claim of 7 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes. Battery life is quite good and can last all day and night on a single charge, but given this is a large phone with a 3,450 mAh battery, that’s not surprising at all. The Pixel’s Secret Weapon  Google knows that a smartphone’s camera is easily it’s most used and valued feature. Their teams of photography gurus and image processing experts spent a year designing and optimizing the entire camera stack. Google boldly claimed that the Pixel had the best camera on any smartphone. Ever. This is a huge claim backed by DXOMark (which, has been referenced by HTC for the high camera score on the HTC 10), While DXOMark is highly regarded, I’m still skeptical of a for profit organization that sells its own photography products making proclamations based on their findings. I decided to test the Pixel’s 12-megapixel camera myself and was, quite frankly, astonished at the high-quality and consistency of the photos and videos that the Pixel produces. I was able to take great photos in a range of conditions, from a dark evening, indoors in a museum and outside on a cloudy day as well as a sunny day. The Pixel’s f/2.0 aperture and 1.55 μm large pixels for clear low-light pictures are one thing, the Pixel also comes  with Fast auto-focus in any light condition with Phase Detection Auto-Focus (PDAF) and Laser Detection Auto-Focus (LDAF). More importantly, Google engineers optimized the software to operate beyond what hardware alone can do. After four weeks of using the Pixel XL as my main smartphone, I learned that it has one of the most remarkable cameras on any smartphone. This may not be the case in terms of hardware specs alone, but the computational muscle and staggering AI that ensures you get the best photos at any condition is simply stunning. The HDR+ implementation, which Google suggests users leave on by default, ensures best photos in any condition. A Smartburst mode can be applied in various situations and the software will pick and choose the best photo of the bunch. As a bonus Google generously offers unlimited online storage of photos and videos shot on the Pixel phones which will be stored at full resolution and backed up from the devices. The Pixel effectively reduces noise, minimizes blur, and gives the best result by taking multiple images and quickly recomposing them to fill in the gaps. HDR+ on the Pixel has zero shutter lag, no other smartphone can claim this when using HDR feature.   The most impressive feature of the Pixel XL is the digital image stabilization. With this feature employed, By using the gyroscope at 200 times a second to anticipate how the camera is moving, you can get blur free video in most conditions. I put together series of sample videos including riding in a car, walking on a beach and others, which show how this image stabilization works. There’s also a comparison with optical image stabilization from a competing 12-megapixel smartphone. Image stabilization is very good, it looks a bit unnatural, sort of like the effect some first-person shooters have when you duck and strafe. Still, there's no denying there's a breakthrough at play here since this smartphone is creating steady video which even on standalone video cameras would require some kind of gimbal or steady-cam type contraption to achieve. Google’s Pixel really delivers impressive video and photo performance in almost any situation and is among the best camera on devices I have tested this year (led by the iPhone 7 Plus as well as the Samsung Galaxy 7). The offer of unlimited online storage on Google Photos (in full resolution, no less) means you should be able to buy the 32GB versions of the Pixel and have more than enough space for unlimited photos and videos. I am a prolific photo-taker and I've already exhausted 14.5 GB of the Pixel XL's 32GB non-expandable storage. Using the 'free up space' feature, I was able to gain back 3.7 GB while my photos are still accessible on Google Photos. Not for the price sensitive The move up from Nexus to Pixel brings us a Googlier experience, better hardware integration and premium features and materials plus a bevy of capabilities that could remain Pixel exclusives long before they trickle down to other OEMs. Each Google Pixel also comes with a hotline, a 24/7 support feature that makes it possible to reach out to a Google expert via chat, voice and even share your screen to help troubleshoot issues. The downside is that the pricing goes up, considerably. The Pixel and the Pixel XL are smack dab in iPhone 7 and premium Samsung territory. It’s easy to simply say that premium features and materials=higher quality and therefore a higher price. But iPhone and other flagship products are long established players. They have retail store support, a wide range of accessories and peripherals, they are a known quantity. Sure, exploding Note7’s have created a crater-sized void in the market and users looking for options can definitely consider a Pixel XL, it’s large, has the killer camera and specs combo and it’s a Pure Google device. That’s great for consumers with $899 burning a hole in their pocket but what about the rest of us. In the past, Nexus devices could be had off contract for under $600, and these had many of the perks that the Pixel line offers plus the air of exclusivity of being Google exclusive devices. There’s no longer a budget option for those who want to go with Google and that’s going to be an issue.  The Pixel XL represents the Google Phone we’ve always wanted in terms of quality, features, innovation and ease of use. Google Assistant is impressive and has what it takes to bloom beyond being a fad feature, the new Pixel launcher is cleaner and more intuitive and the camera and video capability of the Pixel is truly top notch. But, this is still a generation 1 device playing in a hotly contested premium market and it brings a design aesthetic that isn’t entirely new. The Pixel is a good start, but it has a lot to prove that it is worth the price of admission. Note that the fine print says the Pixel and the Pixel XL are good for two years of software updates and three years of security updates. That's all Google guarantees, consider that the Apple iPhone 4 from 2010 just got obsoleted this year (6 years after its release) and weigh that into your long term consideration.  With the demise of Windows Phone and BlackBerry, which have faded into oblivion this year,  many phone buyers who don't subscribe to the Apple way, now have another viable option in the Pixel and the Pixel XL. I'm crossing my fingers that Google will ensure the best possible Android experience available. Hits: -Pixel represents an all new integrated premium Google Phone strategy -Google Assistant is the real deal, the next generation of personal A.I. -The Pixel’s camera achieves astonishing photo and video performance -Best implementation and placement of a fingerprint scanner -Top flight specs, great new launcher and access to exclusive software make the Pixel a compelling flagship -USB Type-C with quick charge -Unlimited free storage for photos and videos in full resolution   Misses: -Pricing is high -No wireless charging or water resistance -No microSD expansion -Design presents nothing new -Review unit sporadically disconnected from data and voice network losing the ability to accept calls or access the Internet -Onboard Google Support had no useful solution for the issue above other than 'contact your carrier'. Verdict: So long Nexus, the Pixel is the new crown jewel of Google’s mobile strategy, and this line of devices is shooting for the stars of the premium smartphone space in terms of materials, build and also pricing. The Pixel XL starts strong with great performance, effortless ease of use, and a stunning camera that many will consider a generational leap from where Nexus cameras were a year ago in terms of speed, quality and performance. Google engineering and innovation run in the Pixel’s DNA even if the hardware design may seem underwhelming and tired. Don’t be fooled, the Pixel XL is every bit the flagship killer that Google set out to make.   Rating: 4.5 out of 5 Gadjo Cardenas Sevilla | Post a Comment | Share Article Print Article Permalink tagged Canada, Google, Pixel, Pixel XL, phone Email Article in Android, Apps & Launches, Breaking news, Buyers Guide, Events and Launches, First Looks, Google, Lifestyle, Mobile, Product launch, Public service Reader Comments There are no comments for this journal entry.

One of the nicer touches that Google added with the Pixel in this writer’s opinion is a wide variety of stock wallpapers to choose from. It seems that the wallpaper picker is pulling some of them from the web, but some others — the ones you see below — are actually found in an APK that ships with the Pixel… You may be aware that these leaked earlier this year, but we thought we would pull apart the APK ourselves now that we have our hands on the Pixel XL and share them with you. We also figured that you might be in search of them now that the Pixel is about to ship, especially if you’re anxiously awaiting yours to hit your doorstep. Yes, that’s a little bit obsessive, but it’s okay. We know how it is. Check out the gallery below to download all the “New elements” and “Sky high” wallpapers from the Pixel in full resolution. These aren’t all the Pixel wallpapers, mind you, but they’re the ones that we could easily get our hands on.

DreamWorks will cooperate with lawyers for former animators and visual effects employees who are pressing forward with their class-action case against Walt Disney Co. and its Lucasfilm and Pixar units, plaintiffs’ attorneys said in a court filing Monday seeking approval of the accord. Two Sony Pictures units and Blue Sky Studios already have won preliminary approval for settlements totaling $19 million. The antitrust suit against the California-based companies is based on allegations that they conspired to suppress wages through a “gentleman’s agreement” not to solicit each other’s workers. Apple, Google, Inc., Intel Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc. last year paid $415 million to resolve their part in a similar case that was brought against a group of Silicon Valley technology companies that had been investigated for collusion by the U.S. Justice Department. In a follow-on case, LG Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. were sued in September over claims they conspired to suppress wages by agreeing not to recruit each other’s employees. Comcast spokeswoman Jennifer Khoury didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Monday’s settlement. Stocks Google hits record high Alphabet Inc. shares hit a record high on Tuesday after mostly positive reviews for its new Pixel phones, the first line of phones designed in-house by its Google unit. The Mountain View company’s stock gained 1.82 percent to close at $821. 49 after earlier reaching $828, the highest price since Google’s shares were first traded in the public markets on Aug. 19, 2004. The mostly positive reviews are a change for Google, a company that has occasionally pushed out glitch-ridden devices before they were ready for mainstream consumption. Automakers Tesla updates delivery date Tesla Motors Inc. said buyers who place new orders for Model 3 vehicles can expect to begin receiving deliveries as soon as mid-2018, with production starting as scheduled late next year. “Production begins late 2017. Delivery estimate for new reservations is mid 2018 or later,” the electric-car marker said on its website Tuesday. Tesla shares briefly pared gains after the news was initially interpreted as a delay in the introduction of the vehicle. The shares rose $5.14 or 2.65 percent to close at $199.10. “Today’s website update doesn’t reflect any change in our plans,” Tesla said. “We still plan to begin Model 3 deliveries in late 2017, and we adjusted the date on our marketing page to reflect more accurate timing for new/future reservation holders.” The Model 3 update comes as Tesla is scheduled to unveil a new product Wednesday, leading to speculation about what the company will announce. Energy Airbnb teams with SolarCity Airbnb Inc. is teaming up with SolarCity Corp. to encourage the home-sharing company’s hosts to install solar-panel systems. Those renting out properties via Airbnb can get up to $1,000 cash back if they use the San Mateo company to install solar systems. That deal is valid through the first three months of 2017; after that, the discount will be $750. Additionally, existing SolarCity customers who become Airbnb hosts will get $100 in credit to stay in an Airbnb property. “This gives the Airbnb host an incredible opportunity to understand the benefit of solar and to really differentiate their property,” said Toby Corey, president of global sales and customer experience at SolarCity. “It represents an entirely new incremental user base for SolarCity.” Chronicle News Services Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps BREAKING NEWS Live updates: Yesterday, you couldn't come to town, today you can't leave. Chaos in capital ... read more Smartphone camera showdown: Google Pixel v iPhone v Samsung JEFFERSON GRAHAM Last updated 12:20, October 19 2016 Reuters Google Pixel got an all-time high ranking of 89 from DxOMark. Google says its new Pixel smartphone camera is the highest rated smartphone camera ever. Ever? Naturally, we set out to find if that was true. But before we jump into our analysis, some quick housekeeping. Google bases its advertising claim on an early review on the mobile smartphone site DxOMark, the lens and camera testing research arm of the DxoLabs camera company. DxO, which says on its Facebook page that no money exchanged hands for the early review heavily touted in Google's advertising, gives Pixel an all-time high ranking of 89. And that compares to 88 for the Samsung Galaxy S7 and 86 for the iPhone 7. But take the rankings have to be taken with a grain of salt, because DxoMark hasn't reviewed the iPhone 7 Plus yet, which has the stronger two-lens package that the iPhone 7 doesn't have and has been considered the best of show since its September release. READ MORE: * Smartphone camera shootout: iPhone SE, Samsung's S7 Edge, Huawei's P9 * Dual-camera smartphones could be the next big thing We took out the XL for a shoot-out, along with the iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, attached to a tripod so we could get similar, back to back results. We shot in great light (mid-day) so-so (dusk) and terrible (pre-dawn.) We shot video while walking and bike riding to test the image stabilisation for video, and shot panoramas, slow-mo video, quasi-360 "photo spheres" and "lens blur" portraits that uses software to produce a "bokeh" effect that puts the background out of focus. The victor? Well, the results from all three are so stellar, they're a testament to just how good little lenses and software have come to produce 2016 state of the art photography. All three make the $500 point-and-shoot camera with limited zoom now irrelevant. They're that good. That said, I would indeed give the nod to the Pixel by a small hair: 9.8 out of 10, to the iPhone 7+'s 9.77 and the Galaxy's 9.76. It's that close. Reuters The Samsung Galaxy S7 scored 88 on the on the mobile smartphone site DxOMark. It comes down to software and usability. So let's dive in: - The Pixel has a 28mm equivalent back wide angle lens with a f2.0 lens opening. That compares to 28mm f1.9 for the iPhone 7 Plus and 26mm f1.7 for Galaxy. The camera has a 4x digital zoom (software speak for cropping the picture instead of truly zooming in) compared to the 10x digital zoom of the iPhone 7 Plus and 8x for S7. (Like with other digital zooms, the Pixel digital zoom quality is lacklustre.) Reuters The iPhone 7 scored 86 on the on the mobile smartphone site DxOMark. - The camera icon is front and centre on the Pixel home screen, and there's no need to search for the Camera Roll, or Gallery app to find your stored photos, as they automatically go to Google Photos, the popular Android and iPhone app for archiving photos. The app offers free unlimited storage for non-Pixel users at a lowered resolution, but on the Pixel, they're stored at full resolution. (If you take photos when the phone is offline, they still go to Google Photos, and get uploaded to the cloud when you're back online.) - HDR+. Like the iPhone and Galaxy, Pixel also offers HDR, the ability to take three shots in a row, one at normal exposure, and the other two under and over, and then combined for one perfect shot. The + stands for "low light", supremacy, Google says. Ad Feedback --Software tricks: They're found by swiping right to go to video mode, where slow motion (for video) panorama, photo sphere (quasi 360) and lens blur settings are found. Lens blur again puts the centre in focus, and you achieve by shooting vertically, and tilting the camera upwards while shooting. This is hard to pull off in a horizontal shot. Burst mode (like the iPhone) lets you hold your finger down on the shutter and get multiple (I picked up to 50) shots at one time, which is great for action. An added bonus: Google automatically produces an animated GIF from the files, which you can share easily.  - Selfies: A switch next to the shutter button lets you flip to the front facing camera for selfie shots. - Manual overrides: White balance adjustments are at the top of the screen, along with a tab to turn the flash on and off. On screen you can adjust focus and exposure pretty effectively. The goods: I've posted 30 back to back shots on my website. I invite you to go in and check out the complete results. Despite the hype, the Pixel isn't a revolutionary camera that will change the way you look at photography and make pros want to ditch their DSLRs. It is another slight step forward in what can be done with a tiny point-and-shoot lens and software. But most of you won't be shooting in the middle of the night. For average, daytime snapshots, group photos at restaurants and homes and the like, you can't go wrong with any of the choices here. And the iPhone 7 Plus adds the secondary portrait lens, which you don't get with the Pixel or the Galaxy. The results for are all three are so close, but has to go to Pixel by a hair for the low-light software tricks that Google has brought to the party.  - MCT Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: Review: Google Pixel smartphone Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

By Jason Hiner | October 18, 2016 -- 14:40 GMT (07:40 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was a keynote speaker at Gartner Symposium ITxpo 2016. Image: Jason Hiner/TechRepublic When Satya Nadella became CEO of Microsoft in 2014, he asked what the company's place in the world is, and how it could make the biggest contribution. What he kept coming back to was that the company builds things that empower people to build their own things. When he looked at Microsoft, he saw software that could be a force to "democratize and empower people." Nadella articulated what that vision means for the future of Azure, Windows, Office, Cortana, Linkedin, and more during his keynote address--on a telepresence link--at Gartner Symposium ITxpo 2016 in Orlando on Tuesday. In conversation with Gartner analysts that featured lots of Nadella's usual well-crafted, nuanced statements, he also boldly declared: "Windows is the most open platform there is." It came in the context of Nadella talking about Microsoft's mission to unite the three big constituencies in the technology world. "That's the approach we've always taken," said Nadella, "bringing users, IT, and developers together... When you bring them together, that's where the magic happens." SEE: Photos: A look inside Google's, Microsoft's and Facebook's datacenters (TechRepublic) He reminded the audience of several thousand technology leaders that Microsoft began by making tools, then it made apps, and now it makes platforms. Or, it buys them. In June, Nadella and company bought Linkedin for $26 billion, and ever since the technology world has wondered what it plans to do with the service that owns the social graph of the working world. "I love Linkedin for Linkedin," said Nadella. "We are just custodians of that data, and we need to add value to that data." He said that the world needs a vibrant professional network where people can realize the value of their skills and find the opportunities to maximize them. But Nadella got most excited when he explained that Linkedin also has valuable solutions for businesses--hiring, marketing, training, and selling -- "and there lies natural opportunities for integration." He specifically pointed to Dynamics and Office 365. The other topic where Microsoft's approach to data privacy came up was Cortana, the company's AI-powered virtual assistant that is competing in an increasingly crowded field that includes players such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and IBM Watson. Nadella highlighted several key principles in Microsoft's approach to privacy on Cortana: Whatever data we have, we have to keep it secure Provide transparency (users know what Cortana knows about them and can control it) Be compliant with regulations In comparison to other AI assistants, Nadella said to look for Microsoft to focus Cortana on the things that Microsoft cares about the most--worker productivity and business processes. Of course, Nadella's baby is Azure. It's the thing he usually talks about the most and the area where Microsoft has the most momentum. On Tuesday, Azure was a bit of a footnote--even though it increasingly powers a lot of the other products and platforms Nadella mentioned. Still, Nadella did take a moment to mention that Azure has now passed certification for government use. "It's exciting to see the public sector being able to tap into the cloud," he said. SEE: Gartner's 10 big trends that will change how IT operates (TechRepublic) Nadella is bound to take some heat for his statement about the openness of Windows, especially from open source advocates who would argue that Linux, OpenBSD, and other open source platforms have claimed that crown for decades. Nadella's argument in this case is about the number of products built on top of Windows--creating billions of dollars worth of value that "dwarfs other platforms." That's unlikely to convince many open source gurus--many of whom are comfortably building solutions using Linux on Azure. But, it's not really Nadella's style to start of war of words over software's moral high ground, and I don't think that was his intention in the keynote. Instead, it was all part of his renewed appeal to attract makers, builders, and coders into the Microsoft fold. He said, "We want to be that platform that enables every developer."

Chaos in capital ... read more Smartphone camera showdown: Google Pixel v iPhone v Samsung JEFFERSON GRAHAM Last updated 12:20, October 19 2016 Reuters Google Pixel got an all-time high ranking of 89 from DxOMark. Google says its new Pixel smartphone camera is the highest rated smartphone camera ever. Ever? Naturally, we set out to find if that was true. But before we jump into our analysis, some quick housekeeping. Google bases its advertising claim on an early review on the mobile smartphone site DxOMark, the lens and camera testing research arm of the DxoLabs camera company. DxO, which says on its Facebook page that no money exchanged hands for the early review heavily touted in Google's advertising, gives Pixel an all-time high ranking of 89. And that compares to 88 for the Samsung Galaxy S7 and 86 for the iPhone 7. But take the rankings have to be taken with a grain of salt, because DxoMark hasn't reviewed the iPhone 7 Plus yet, which has the stronger two-lens package that the iPhone 7 doesn't have and has been considered the best of show since its September release. READ MORE: * Smartphone camera shootout: iPhone SE, Samsung's S7 Edge, Huawei's P9 * Dual-camera smartphones could be the next big thing We took out the XL for a shoot-out, along with the iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, attached to a tripod so we could get similar, back to back results. We shot in great light (mid-day) so-so (dusk) and terrible (pre-dawn.) We shot video while walking and bike riding to test the image stabilisation for video, and shot panoramas, slow-mo video, quasi-360 "photo spheres" and "lens blur" portraits that uses software to produce a "bokeh" effect that puts the background out of focus. The victor? Well, the results from all three are so stellar, they're a testament to just how good little lenses and software have come to produce 2016 state of the art photography. All three make the $500 point-and-shoot camera with limited zoom now irrelevant. They're that good.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (33) Post your comment Google Pixel XL review roundup 18 October 2016 You may have noticed, there is a bunch of Google Pixel phone reviews flying in every direction. If you have been wondering why every tech website out there has one today, the reason is that Googles review embargo has officially been lifted and were all allowed to have our say about Googles latest smartphones. Except, we personally dont have that much to say yet, as our review units were stranded somewhere along their way to us. As we were checking out the detailed hands-on accounts of our fellow tech journalists, we figured you actually might find it useful if we distilled what they all have to say about the phones - and we focused on the Google Pixel XL as it got much more attention than its 5-inch sibling. Rest assured, a review of our own is coming, but it won't be out before next week. Stay tuned! Disclaimer: We dont necessarily support all the opinions of our colleagues. Frankly, some the quotes below may come through as way too polarizing, but even if you disagree with them, we hope that at least you will be able to appreciate their entertainment value. We cant have the others have all the fun, right? So here's what some of the most popular mobile tech websites have to say about the Google Pixel phones. On design David Ruddock of AndroidPolice: "Lacking a camera hump on the rear, the Pixel really is a minimalist phone design. Frankly, for what praise I can give to Google on the look and feel of quality, I can't award much for actual appearance. At its best, in the black finish, the Pixel looks vaguely generic." Chris Velazco of Engadget: "I wish the Pixels looked a little more distinctive. Google's true art is software, and one could argue this low-key design was meant to let that software really own the spotlight. That, or Google just doesn't have a great grasp on what beautiful hardware looks like yet. That glass panel is an ... interesting design choice, to say the least. For the most part, the components Google and HTC have stuck in the Pixels are first-rate. They're just sort of let down by their sense of style, or lack thereof." Google Pixel XL Dieter Bohn of The Verge: "On the front, it's easy to kvetch about the large bezel on the bottom, but I don't mind it; it makes the phone feel balanced and it's more comfortable to hit the on-screen home button. Maybe Google will do that eventually [find its own, techier aesthetic like Samsung], but for this first try I think it wants the thing to look like what people are used to. People are used to iPhones." Walt Mossberg of The Verge: "Its a pleasant, familiar design that feels good in the hand. But it isnt an attempt to show off any design or hardware chops and it gives Apple a break in a year when the new iPhone has the same body for a third year in a row." Juan Carlos Torres of AndroidCommunity: "Unfortunately, the Pixel leaves a lasting first impression that can be described as ambiguous at best. Unfortunately for Android fans, some of the details that do make the Pixel unique arent exactly flattering." Stephen S. of PhoneArena "Crafting a smartphone these days that offers a unique look is no small feat. As some brands churn out featureless slate after featureless slate, or others find themselves repeating variations on the same standard design over and over again, a breath of fresh air can be hard to come by. But with Google's new Pixel phones, the company may have done just that." Michael Nunez of Gizmodo: "The Pixel is an ugly phone. The design is nowhere near as sleek, clean, and easy to use as the iPhone 7." Our commentary: Most tech reviewers, us included, find the design - and more specifically the glass rectangle on the back - ugly. But most people opt for the extra protection and the peace of mind that a protective case brings along. In other words, if you are going to slap a case on it anyway, there isn't much use in discussing the design aesthetics of the back, is it? On Google Assistant David Ruddock of AndroidPolice: "I think the potential of Assistant is amazing. But the experience right now is... not. It's just Google's intelligent search results with a more streamlined interface. It's just that the current Assistant experience simply isn't as intelligent or powerful as Google wanted us all to believe when it got on stage and talked about it like it was ready to change the world. Maybe it will be ready in a few years. Right now, we've got a skeletal version - a promising blueprint. But sorry, this isn't going to sell phones, not as it works now." Chris Velazco of Engadget: "All told, Google's Assistant is a surprisingly thoughtful system as long as you play within the range of prescribed actions. When it can't figure out a more appropriate way to respond, the Assistant just defaults to reading web search results." Dieter Bohn of The Verge: "And like all [digital] assistants, this Assistant is kinda dumb. It still has ways to go but it's probably the best there is out there right now. That just doesn't mean that it's amazing." Walt Mossberg of The Verge: "The Assistant blew away every competitor Ive tried. It shredded Siri, which has a five-year lead. It not only did on-phone tasks reliably  like launching an app, or creating reminders or notes or playing music  but it understood most of the wider-world questions I asked it. Even more impressively, it remembered the general subject I was asking about, so I didnt have to repeat the topic with every question." Michael Nunez of Gizmodo: "Googles AI is too stupid to be meaningfully helpful at this stage. Googles is better than whats offered by competitors. [But] smartphone assistants arent smart enough to be defining features." Juan Carlos Torres of AndroidCommunity: "Google Assistant holds a lot of promise and makes even more promises. But in its current incarnation in the Pixel, it is clearly still rough around the edges." Our commentary: Googles AI is certainly more capable than Apples Siri and Microsofts Cortana and you would probably be happy with it as long as you keep your expectations in check. On the camera David Ruddock of AndroidPolice: "In my opinion, the Pixel is the best smartphone camera on the market. It's not just the quality of photos; it's everything that makes the camera so capable and simple. I've simply never used a smartphone camera that is this fast. While not as reliable on focus as Samsung's crazy-fast dual pixel AF, or as able to draw out light in extremely dark conditions, the Pixel makes up for these technical shortcomings with a host of practical advantages and photo quality that, to me, feels the most natural and realistic of any smartphone this year." Chris Velazco of Engadget: "While not perfect, Google's pair of Pixels can indeed capture fantastic photos -- detailed and crisp, with mostly correct colors. It shouldn't surprise you to hear that the Pixel and Pixel XL excel in bright conditions, but their cameras are actually remarkable in dim situations too. I occasionally noticed that the hybrid laser-and-phase-detection autofocus system got skittish while trying to lock onto a subject." Dieter Bohn of The Verge: "The [camera] results on the Pixel are very, very good. I put it in the same ballpark as the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7 in most situations, which is not something I expected to say going in. The distinctions between all three of these phone cameras are more about the stylistic decisions each company is making. Both Google and Samsung are slightly more aggressive at processing the image into something pleasing, while the iPhone seems to give a more natural look. The camera app opens fast and takes pictures immediately." Walt Mossberg of The Verge: "The Pixel has a very good camera that should please almost every user in almost every situation." Stephen S. of PhoneArena "The camera's fast as hell to use, grabbing focus in a snap thanks to both its phase-detection and laser-assisted techniques, and even HDR processing doesn't really slow things down. We're not sure if it's really the best camera ever on a smartphone  that's one heck of a high bar  but the Pixel XL is very much up there among some of the best-performing models you can pick up today." Juan Carlos Torres of AndroidCommunity: "Of course, the camera works best in bright light, but it was able to produce acceptable images [in low light], albeit with some expected grain." Michael Nunez of Gizmodo: "Google has really harped on this feature [the camera], and based on our naked-eye assessment, the Pixel lives up to most of that hype. Every shot is accurately colored, super sharp compared to other Android phones, and vibrant as hell." Our commentary: The Pixel camera seems to be quite good and gets a lot of things right. Stuff such as fine detail, dynamic range, and colors are all superb for a cameraphone. The HDR+ mode has been revamped and should help tremendously in improving low light photos  less noise in the shadows and more color. The Electronic Stabilization System works tremendously well in stabilizing videos. On battery life Chris Velazco of Engadget: "All told, I could reliably squeeze a day and a half of use out of it on a single charge, or closer to two workdays, even, when I took things slow." Dieter Bohn of The Verge: "Over the week and a half I tested the phones, I got absolutely stupendous battery life, especially on the Pixel XL. Last Sunday I streamed two hours of the Vikings-Texans game, used the phone throughout the day, and obsessively scrolled Twitter during the presidential debate. At the end of the day I was still at 30 percent." David Ruddock of AndroidPolice: "I would say this [battery life] is comparable to what I typically get with the Galaxy S7 edge (SD820 version), a device that has been lauded for its battery life. As such, I'm actually pretty happy with the Pixel XL in this regard." Stephen S. of PhoneArena "In our custom battery tests, that [the battery capacity] translated into a little under seven-and-a-half hours of continuous screen-on time. Compared to other phones with similar hardware, that's in the right ballpark of expectations; it's nothing game-changing, but nor does it disappoint." Our commentary: It seems the Pixel XL battery life will be one of its strong suits, though we dont expect it to win any awards. On whether you should buy it David Ruddock of AndroidPolice: "So, are the Pixels good value for money? Sure, if you're of the opinion that an iPhone is good value for money. Are they great value for money? Probably not. In that sense, they're typical. What you're paying for here is more the promise of future support, advanced software features, and for an experience that is purely Google." Dieter Bohn of The Verge: "This is Google's first phone, and for a first effort it is remarkably good. By almost every metric I can think of  speed, power, camera, smart assistant, you name it  it matches or exceeds the best phones available on the market today. And though the design is far from groundbreaking, its certainly approachable. The whole package is pretty incredible, and if you're not put off by the premium price, you'll be very happy with this premium phone." Walt Mossberg of The Verge: "If youre an Android fan, willing to buy a premium phone, the Pixel is your answer. To repeat: its simply the best Android phone Ive tested. If youre an iPhone user thinking of switching, the Pixel will seem physically familiar, but youll have to overcome the sticky links youve developed with fellow iPhone users, things like iMessage (which Google cant match yet) and iCloud Photo Sharing (which Google is trying to copy). Youll also have to do without the comfort of your neighborhood Genius Bar." Stephen S. of PhoneArena "Who's the Pixel XL for, then? Really, this phone is all about Google's services, and if you're already an Android user with your pics, movies, music, communications, and all that good stuff tied up with Google's servers, the Pixel XL will be ready to hit the ground running, giving you a really tight, nicely integrated smartphone experience. The Pixel brand represents a new beginning for Google's smartphone efforts, and this looks like a great place to start." Juan Carlos Torres of AndroidCommunity: "Whereas the Nexus showcased the best of what the Android operating system has to offer, the Pixel is meant to flaunt Googles chops in search, cloud storage, and, most especially, machine learning and artificial intelligence. That, in the final analysis, makes the Pixel a harder sell. In the end, the Google Pixel is a smartphone clearly designed by Google, but also clearly designed for those who really believe in Google as well." Michael Nunez of Gizmodo: "Would I recommend this phone to the average person? The short answer is "no." If youre like me, and have avoided the iPhone all these years, its time to give in. The iPhone is definitively better this year. The current roster of flagship Android phones are a complete joke." Final words Google could have done better with the design and features of their top phone if they wanted to sell it in huge numbers. Pricing seems to be a huge divisive point the two phones cost as much as the current gen iPhones, which are, give or take, the most expensive phones on the market. The pricing comes especially surprising to the American market where the Google Nexus phones have always been considered inexpensive smartphones with a great value-for-money ratio (not as much in Europe, though). The Pixel XL is a really good phone but so are the competitions smartphones. Since the Pixel XL doesnt have a real trump card and since Google is not intent on undercutting the competition with pricing alone, we can only assume that they will try to win the market the Apple way - a small device portfolio with premium branding. The Pixel XL, however, is not the disruptive proposition that the original iPhone was so it won't be overtaking the ship overnight. Its going to be a gradual process (if they ever succeed) so we think it would take a few more years until we announce Google as a phone maker to be reckoned with, even though its a market that they helped build in the first place. Here are the full reviews themselves. There are certainly other excellent tech websites and we don't intend to suggest that these are the best reviews out there.

Those aren’t the only barriers, though, the study determined. “Underrepresented groups also face social barriers to learning computer science, such as the continuing perception that computer science is only for certain groups, namely white or Asian males,” Google and Gallup reported. Mountain View-based Google also released some studies that served as companion reports to the primary research. “Black students are less likely than white students to have access to a computer science class in school,” Google and Gallup reported. “Female students are less likely to be aware of computer science learning opportunities online and in their community.” Despite those barriers, black students are l.5 times more more likely than white students, and Hispanic students are 1.7 times more likely than white students, to be “very interested” computer science learning, the research determined. An estimated 47 percent of black students say they have dedicated computer science classes, compared with 58 percent of white students and 59 percent of Hispanic students. An estimated 58 percent of black and 50 percent of Hispanic students use a computer at least most days at home. That is compared with 68 percent of white students with such usage frequency. Google reported through the research that 39 percent of girls are being told by parents or teachers that they would be good at computer science. That’s well below the 56 percent of boys who receive such encouragement. Girls also are less likely than boys to be aware of computer science learning opportunities outside of school. Gallup surveyed students, parents and teachers during portions of December 2015 and January 2016. The survey polled 1,672 students in grades seven through 12, 1,677 parents with at least one student in those grade levels, and 1,008 teachers in grades one through 12. The study suggested that school officials have begun to remedy the technology learning gap. “We found that 40 percent of K-12 principals say they offer CS classes with programming/coding, up from 25 percent the year before,” Google reported. “However, a great deal of work still remains.”   Photo illustration from Miami Herald/MCT archives Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: African-Americans, black, computer science, education, Gallup, gender, Google, Hispanic, Mountain View, Silicon Valley, Tech   More Posts in Silicon Beat California expected to top quarter-million EVs this month November 14, 2016   Apple will ‘suffer’ if Trump starts trade war, Chinese government-backed media warns November 14, 2016   Edward Snowden to speak at Oakland conference November 14, 2016       Share this Post Tweet           About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter GMSV     Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Is activist investor Starboard looking to run at Hewlett… Petition for electoral college coup against Trump gets more… Surveillance, encryption concerns in the wake of Donald… Social media and the election through the eyes of Donald… Grubhub CEO faces backlash for anti-Trump message to…     Archives Archives Select Month November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2016 Bay Area News Group.

The results released Tuesday represented Yahoo's first financial update since announcing in late July its deal to sell its digital operations to Verizon. The numbers showed Yahoo is profiting from a cost-cutting program that has jettisoned 2,200 workers, or about one-fifth of its workforce, during the past year. The Sunnyvale, California, company earned $163 million, or 17 cents per share, more than doubling from the same time last year. But Yahoo's revenue plunged 14 per cent to $857 million after subtracting advertising commissions for the period covering July through September. It marks the fourth consecutive quarter that Yahoo's net revenue has dropped by at least 10 per cent, a trend that management forecast will extend into the final three months of this year. ___ Google's Pixel phone: Not much new, but still a standout NEW YORK (AP) — Google's ambitious new smartphone, the Pixel, doesn't offer a lot that's new. Yet it's still one of the best out there. Google achieves that by pulling together the best features from Apple, Samsung and other phone makers and offering them at prices comparable to iPhones — starting at about $650 for the regular, 5-inch model and $770 for the 5.5-inch "XL" edition. Both versions go on sale Thursday through Verizon, Best Buy and Google's online store. The Pixel isn't quite an iPhone replacement, as Google wants you to believe; hardware is just part of what makes an iPhone an iPhone. But it might serve up a strong challenge to Samsung, especially as people look for alternatives to the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. ___ US stocks rebound on strong company earnings; oil rises Surprisingly strong earnings from Netflix, UnitedHealth Group and other companies put investors in a buying mood Tuesday, driving U.S. stocks solidly higher. Health care stocks led the gainers. Materials, utilities and a broad swath of other companies also posted gains. Industrials and consumer-focused stocks notched the smallest gains. Energy stocks also rose as the price of crude oil recovered from an earlier slide. The rally wiped out the market's losses from the day before. ___ $4 a month? Social Security recipients to get tiny increase WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Social Security recipients and federal retirees will get a 0.3 per cent increase in monthly benefits next year, the fifth year in a row that older Americans will have to settle for historically low raises. The adjustment adds up to a monthly increase of less than $4 a month for an average recipient. The cost-of-living adjustment, announced by the government Tuesday, will affect more than 70 million people — about 1 in 5 Americans. For recipients, the average monthly Social Security payment now is $1,238. Unfortunately for some seniors, even the small increase will probably be wiped out by an expected increase in Medicare Part B premiums, which are usually deducted from Social Security payments. ___ Trading gains drive Goldman Sachs' profits sharply higher NEW YORK (AP) — Goldman Sachs' earnings soared in the third quarter, driven largely by trading and investment gains. The results easily surpassed analysts' estimates. The New York-based bank said Tuesday that it earned $2.1 billion, or $4.88 per share, up from $1.33 billion, or $2.90 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Wall Street analysts were expecting Goldman to earn $3.82 a share, according to FactSet. While the firm's investment banking division reported flat revenue, a reflection of the fact fewer companies did deals in the quarter, Goldman's trading desks and the division where it invests its own money did exceptionally well. Revenue in Goldman's fixed income, currencies and commodities division jumped 34 per cent to $1.96 billion. Goldman benefited from similar forces that helped boost trading of other major Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America. ___ A surprisingly high number of first-timers now buying homes WASHINGTON (AP) — For years, the U.S. housing market looked bleak for young couples hoping to buy their first homes but struggling with high student debt, low pay and meagre down-payment savings. But a new survey by the real estate firm Zillow suggests that first-time buyers may be entering the market in greater numbers than industry watchers had assumed. Over the past year, the survey found, nearly half of home sales have gone to first-timers. That's a much higher proportion than some other industry estimates had indicated. And it comes as a surprise in part because ownership rates for adults under 34 are at their lowest levels since the government began tracking the figure in 1994. ___ Gov't announces new steps to protect airline consumers WASHINGTON (AP) — Airlines would be required to refund fees when checked bags are "substantially delayed" under a proposal released Tuesday by the Transportation Department, one of a series of steps the Obama administration says it's taking to boost consumer protections for passengers. The government already requires airlines to refund fees for bags that are lost, but the proposal would go a step further by including delayed bags. Transportation officials said they haven't yet defined what constitutes a substantial delay. ___ US consumer prices rose in September on higher oil costs WASHINGTON (AP) — Higher energy costs fueled U.S. consumer prices in September, but overall inflation remained in check as it has for the past several years. The Labor Department said Tuesday that consumer prices increased 0.3 per cent last month. Much of that rise stemmed from energy, housing and prescription drugs. Energy costs surged 2.9 per cent in September as oil and gasoline prices rebounded from recent lows. Previous price declines still mean that gas costs 6.4 per cent less than a year ago. Inflation has stayed relatively low despite job growth that has brought more workers into the economy. Until last month, the modest levels of inflation largely came from muted oil prices and a stronger dollar. ___ US homebuilders' confidence eases slightly U.S. homebuilders' confidence eased this month after surging to the highest level in nearly a year in September. Even so, builders remain optimistic overall about sales growth in months ahead, a reflection of how steady job gains are leading more Americans to buy newly built homes. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Tuesday fell two points this month to 63 following a reading of 65 in September. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has held above 60 the past two months after hovering at 58 earlier this year. ___ Foreign holdings of US Treasury securities fell in August WASHINGTON (AP) — Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities fell again in August as China, the biggest foreign owner of Treasury debt, trimmed its holdings for the third straight month. The Treasury Department reported Tuesday that total foreign holdings dropped 0.8 per cent to $6.20 trillion in August following a 0.5 per cent decline in July. China reduced its holdings 2.7 per cent to $1.19 trillion after declines of 1.8 per cent in July and 0.3 per cent in June. Japan, the second largest foreign holder of Treasury debt, reduced its holdings by 0.9 per cent to $1.14 trillion in August. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gained 75.54 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 18,161.94. Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 13.10 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 2,139.60. The Nasdaq composite index added 44.01 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 5,243.84. U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 35 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to close at $50.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 16 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to close at $51.68 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline inched up a penny to $1.51 a gallon. Heating oil was little changed at $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas rose 2 cents to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

SUBSCRIBE How Trump & Clinton have failed to use free space in Google for US presidential candidates For a week, neither campaign used the special program giving them guaranteed listings in Google for their name. Danny Sullivan on October 18, 2016 at 6:57 pm More With the US presidential election hotter than ever, Google’s program to give the major candidates valuable yet entirely free space in its search results wasn’t used by either campaign for the past week. The Hillary Clinton campaign finally began using the space again today, while the Donald Trump campaign has yet to resume. Free space for candidates, provided by Google The space is provided through a program that lacks an official name but is commonly referred to by those outside Google as Google Podium or Google Posts. It allows both of the major candidates to have whatever they want to appear in Google’s search results in response to a search for their names. Here’s an example of how it looks for a “Hillary Clinton” search: I can’t show an example for the Trump campaign because it hasn’t posted within the last seven days, for some reason. The section only shows posts from the last seven days. Trump’s campaign has used the program in the past, like this at the end of September: When I was checking on search results for both candidates today, I noticed that the special section was missing for Trump results. That made me think perhaps the Trump campaign had stopped making use of the feature. After all, it has done that before. It had a six-month gap between posts — from March through August of this year — before resuming at the end of September. But digging further into the issue, I noticed that both the Clinton and Trump campaigns stopped posting at nearly the same time earlier this month. Space goes unused for a week The Trump campaign stopped posting as of October 9. The Clinton campaign stopped posting as of October 10, until it resumed earlier today (and for the record, the resumption happened before I contacted Google or either campaign about this story). You can see all the posts from both campaigns here: Clinton and Trump. Here’s a side-by-side of the latest posts by both: Clinton’s campaign has been far more consistent than Trump’s in posting, though it also had a large gap from April through mid-June. I’ve asked both campaigns for comments but have yet to hear back. My assumption is that neither campaign sees making use of this free space as essential and likely doesn’t bother with it at times. If so, that’s extremely odd. Both campaigns appear to be running paid ads on Google (Clinton for “Hillary Clinton” and Trump for “Donald J Trump”). It’s strange they would spend money on paid Google listings but not take advantage of getting free ones in a guaranteed space. As for Google, it gave me this statement: Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have access to this experimental search feature and have used it in the past. Posts appear for 7 days and if there is no new information shared, the carousel will not appear in Search until they post again. In short, if you don’t see candidates with posts appearing in that area, that’s down to their campaigns, not Google. It’s still running the experimental program as usual.

Lack of data makes it hard to know By Michael Laris / The Washington Post Published: Tuesday, October 18th, 2016 at 4:57pm Updated: Tuesday, October 18th, 2016 at 6:15pm An instrument panel illustrates the road ahead using autopilot technology in a Tesla Model S P90D vehicle. MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Christopher Goodney Christopher Goodney, Bloomberg .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........President Barack Obama says automated vehicles could cut the yearly death toll on U.S. roads by tens of thousands. His highway safety chief talks about “a world where we could potentially prevent or mitigate 19 of every 20 crashes on the road.” Uber says self-driving cars “can help save millions of lives” worldwide. Their message is clear: Robots will be better drivers than we are. But despite the excitement and the hype, top engineers and federal regulators face a basic problem. They’re still struggling with exactly how to compare man (or woman) with machine. “One of the hardest questions to answer is, ‘How do these cars compare to human drivers?’ ” Chris Urmson, then the chief of Google’s self-driving car project, told transportation engineers in Washington, D.C., this year. “And part of the reason why that’s hard is we don’t actually have a good understanding of how good human drivers really are.” Advertisement Continue reading One problem is that the U.S. government keeps no comprehensive database of crashes. That complicates what otherwise might seem to be a simple task: figuring out which vehicles are more likely to crash, human-driven ones or those run by software and sensors. Researchers at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, in a study funded by Google, dug into the data and discovered just how incomplete the federal numbers are. An annual national tally of crashes relies heavily on those reported to police. It understates the actual total of crashes with injuries by at least a quarter and “property damage only” crashes by anywhere from 60 to 84 percent, they concluded. And they consider those numbers conservative, given the mishmash of state reporting requirements and holes in the local data used by federal agencies. “It is crazy,” said Myra Blanco, a senior Virginia Tech researcher who was lead author on the study. “We knew there were going to be some discrepancies” with other sources, but not that many. Many drivers prefer to keep crashes off the books, either because they can’t be bothered to report minor run-ins or to avoid insurance premium hikes. The researchers cited an earlier federal analysis and telephone survey for the lower-end estimates of the underreporting. A bigger shortfall was revealed by in-car cameras that captured thousands of motorists in the wild as part of a major federal safety study. Even though they had volunteered to cooperate – and be recorded – some of those drivers failed to notify researchers when they crashed as they were told to. “As human beings, we don’t want people to think poorly of us,” Blanco said. Advertisement Continue reading But the cameras didn’t lie: 84 percent of crashes weren’t reported to police. Based on general accident data, Google’s self-driving cars appeared to crash more often than cars operated by humans. But once the underreporting was factored in, they performed better than people. The researchers also noted that the self-driving cars were not at fault in any of 11 crashes studied. The small numbers made it statistically tough to identify “true differences,” the researchers said. “We understand this is just directional, and we understand it’s not definitive. But it’s exciting and interesting,” said Urmson, a longtime driverless-car leader who left Google this summer. Police-reported crashes reached 6.3 million last year, according to U.S. figures, about half the number reported to insurers. One federal study estimated 13.6 million total crashes in a year; Virginia Tech used an upper estimate of 29 million. Google wants the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to cut through the noise and create a comprehensive database or provide reliable sampling”in order to accurately benchmark the performance of self-driving vehicles.” NHTSA chief Mark Rosekind said this summer that “equivalency” between human and machine is far from good enough. “We should not move forward when automated vehicles are just as safe – or really, as dangerous – as human drivers. They need to be much safer,” Rosekind told industry leaders in San Francisco. He made it clear that how much safer was enough remains an open question: “Two times safer? Five times? Ten times? And what does ‘safer’ actually mean?” Road deaths, tracked in a detailed census, climbed 7 percent to 35,092 last year, and alarmed federal officials this month said they soared an additional 10 percent in the first half of 2016. Advertisement Continue reading Rosekind has been traveling the country asking manufacturers, software developers and safety experts some version of the same question: “What are the new safety metrics we need to be using now? Do we count by crashes? Do we count by fatalities?” He also pressed for ways to “count the lives saved” by the technology. In policy guidance for tech and auto companies released last month, federal officials laid out a 15-point safety assessment. Companies are asked to describe where and under what conditions their cars are designed to drive: for instance, in daylight on dry roads or in a particular city. Then they’re asked to document how they know the cars will be safe. But officials didn’t set out actual safety measurements, saying the federal government first needs to do more research, including gaining real world insights from the companies. Coming up with “performance metrics” was put on the list of “follow-on actions.” Skeptics see this as a bad sign. “It actually speaks volumes when an agency says: ‘Help us. We don’t even know how to measure you,’ ” said Missy Cummings, who heads Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab and has warned that self-driving cars have been unleashed before being proved safe. “That’s the job.” Others called that an unfair swipe at a federal effort to tap the expertise of private industry in a fast-changing area. Federal officials say they want to avoid imposing half-cocked standards that end up stymieing innovation. They also say the regulator’s traditional job description needs to be reexamined. Advertisement Continue reading “There’s a tremendous power in harnessing this technology for good,” said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. Regulations will come later, as industry and the department learn more, Foxx said. Although regulations in the past have generally been put in place after technologies have gone to market, Foxx said, the department is trying to shape safety on the front end. “But you can only begin at the beginning, and that’s where we are today,” Foxx said. Still, the question remains: How will the government know when algorithms are safer than humans? How will companies know? And which humans are we actually talking about being better than? “Twice as good as what? Twice as good as a 16-year-old? Twice as good as a 50-year-old?” asked Brandon Schoettle of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Who you choose for the sake of comparison “really makes a big difference,” Schoettle said. Complicating matters further, experience is just one of countless variables. Drunken drivers are involved in about a third of all fatal crashes, for example, dragging down the stats for the rest of us. “If you’re an alert, attentive, sober driver, your risk is really low. You’re really good at avoiding crashes,” said Tom Dingus, director of the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. “It will be difficult making automated vehicles that are as good at avoiding crashes as you are.” Over 25 years, the average driver will successfully step on the brakes 3 million times and smash into the car ahead just once, Dingus said. Beating that performance in all conditions will be tougher than people think. Advertisement Continue reading In the meantime, there will be a range of designs and results, Dingus said. That’s particularly true with partially automated cars, in which the human driver is supposed to be ready to take control at any moment. “There’s likely to be good ones and bad ones. There may be some that actually increase crashes and not decrease them,” Dingus said. Pioneering electric carmaker Tesla has collected tens of millions of miles of driving data from customers’ cars to see how its semi-automated features stack up. Tesla says human drivers working with its “autopilot” technology are safer than humans driving alone, despite a crash death in May. The company noted that one person dies for every 89 million miles traveled on U.S. roads. “Autopilot miles will soon exceed twice that number, and the system gets better every day,” Tesla said. The company says “both the frequency and severity of collisions” should be part of any metrics evaluated by the government. Whether or not they end up being required by law, “I think everybody agrees there need to be metrics” and effective tests to make sure driverless cars are “really ready,” Dingus said. For now, the lifesaving promise of automation often gets boiled down to a single statistic: 94 percent. Obama, safety regulators, Google, Tesla and Uber all cite the number. It’s the share of U.S. car crashes that, as Obama put it, are “the result of human error or choice,” a catchall for the combination of imperfections, idiocies and tragic mistakes that hurt millions every year. It’s a basis for the broad safety claims made by industry and officials. Advertisement Continue reading But knowing the depth of human havoc on the road is just the beginning. “It’s too simplistic to think that because 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error, that taking the human out of the equation is going to eliminate 94 percent of the crashes,” said David Zuby, chief research officer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Tracking actual safety gains will be messy. For many years, humans may do better in some areas while robots outperform them in others. “You may just need to set up different comparison groups and convince yourself, ‘Maybe in this one comparison we’re not better than humans, but look at all these areas where our crash rates are better than humans,’ ” Zuby said. And as cars with imperfect automation are turned loose on the roads, which he finds likely, “it will be interesting to see how many crashes they really eliminate. There isn’t really a good way to know that without seeing it.” driverless-safety-repeat Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

But Nexus' days are over, and Google has jumped directly into the phone design game, releasing the Pixel and Pixel XL.  While the Nexus phones were mid-range devices, made to mid-range specs and sold for mid-range prices, the Pixel and Pixel XL were designed to be flagship phones through and through — from the specs to (sadly) the price. So, how do they stack up to the rest of the Android universe — and to the iPhone 7?  The Best Android Phone Ever? Yes, The Best Android Phone Ever "The best Android phone money can buy." [VentureBeat] "The Pixel is easily the best Android phone I’ve ever tested." [Recode] "Google hit a home run." [The Verge]  "[The Pixel is] the best pint-sized Android phone we’ve used all year." [Digital Trends] "The best Android phone." [Ars Technica] The Design Leaves Something (Or A Lot) To Be Desired Assessments of the Pixel's design range from "unexciting" to "ugly": It's increasingly difficult to put a screen on the front of a 5- to 6-inch metal slab in a way that actually turns heads and opens wallets... The fruit of Google's labor is a phone that's pleasing to both the eyes and the hand, yet at the same time feels relatively safe and non-risky in design terms. [Android Central]  The Pixel is an ugly phone. The design is a little wider and taller than last year’s Nexus 6P, and the bezel on the bottom lip of the phone is much bigger. Yuck. There’s also a big slab of plastic at the top of the phone’s back that feels sticky and a little uncomfortable to hold. The design is nowhere near as sleek, clean, and easy to use as the iPhone 7. These are all weirdly regressive design choices, but the most regressive is that the phone isn’t water resistant. [Gizmodo]  And Battery Life Is Still Up In The Air Battery life is notoriously hard to gauge, and Pixel reviewers came back with different reports. The good: Both phones proved to be serious contenders in day-to-day use as well. After a full day of work, the XL would typically hover around 46 percent, and then, when my schedule quieted down, it just sipped on its remaining power. All told, I could reliably squeeze a day and a half of use out of it on a single charge, or closer to two workdays, even, when I took things slow. The smaller Pixel fared well too, sticking around for a full day and clinging to life the next morning. [Engadget]  The not-so-good: [I]n my short few days of testing, using the smaller Pixel, I never approached the 13 hours or so Google claimed for most activities. On a day when I was focused on battery life, streaming a 90-minute movie and playing music for hours, I got only a few minutes over nine hours — not even enough to get most people through a full work day, including commutes. [Recode]  But The Camera Is On Par With The iPhone 7 Plus If Apple's consistently great camera offerings have kept you in the iPhone camp, the Pixel could give you a reason to consider Android: The "best ever" label may be up for debate, but the Pixel camera consistently produces great shots for a smartphone camera. Smartphone cameras are all so good now that there isn't much separation to see in well-lit shots, but in low light the Pixel captures stands out when producing bright colors and preserving detail. It's easily on par with the iPhone 7 Plus camera — despite that one having two lenses. [Ars Technica]  CNET took the Pixel and the iPhone 7 Plus out for a test run. You can check out the photos here — and here's their conclusion: If you tend to shoot portraits and that's what matters to you most, the iPhone 7 Plus is an obvious choice. Portrait mode is dSLR-esque in beta and we only expect it to improve by the time it gets a public release. But if brighter colors, sharper detail throughout the backgrounds of photos and capable low-light photography is more important, it's the Pixel. I have to admit, I initially thought Google over-promised on its new flagship — especially after those disappointing Nexus — but I was wrong. It's a new chapter for Google phones and this one earned its name. [CNET]  It's Plenty Fast Performance is superb on the Pixel XL, which is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip and 4GB of RAM. When you do something, it responds without delay. Swipe up from the bottom? Up the icons come. Swipe down? Down they go, just as fast as they appeared. Swipe down from the top? Here come the notifications. Down again? There are the quick settings. Up? Notifications. Up again? Back to the home screen. Apps open immediately. In short, the user interface always responds instantly to your input. This is freeing. But the best part is that unlike some phones, the Pixel XL doesn’t slow down when you’re low on battery life. [VentureBeat]  And It's Finally Simple And Intuitive — Like An iPhone The iPhone is the Default Phone, the one you buy when you want a phone, not a project. The Google Pixel changes that. It offers the look and competence of an iPhone, with a truly great camera and loads of innovative software and services. It changes my answer to the question I hear most often: What phone should you get? You should get a Pixel. [WIRED]  Google Assistant Is The Best AI Assistant... But That Still Doesn't Mean Much To be very clear: the Google Assistant is absolutely the smartest of the assistant bunch, but it's not yet in a class of its own. Google knows so much more about me than, say, Apple, and it’s assistant should reflect that. Because Google itself is placing so much emphasis on the Assistant, it should be held to a higher standard than all the rest — and there's clearly still some work to do. [The Verge] In its current state, attempting to accomplish complex tasks with Assistant on Pixel will waste more time than it saves. [New York Times] TL;DR — Yeah, It's Good The Pixel isn’t a slam dunk that suddenly makes all other premium Android phones obsolete. But if you want a high-end phone, it deserves to be on your short list. And if you’re sick of bloatware, heavily customized interfaces, and delayed OS updates, there’s really no other choice.

An attempt Tuesday brought back the following proposals: "How to register to vote" "How to play Pokemon Go" "How to be single" "How to tie a tie" What are the most commonly Googled "How to" searches in the country? What about by state? What questions do Oregonians ask Google most often? A blogger at Estately decided to figure out the answer to that question. Using Google's autocomplete function, he generated hundreds of the most popular how-to-questions typed into Google. He then ran that group of searches through Google Trends, providing a look at which searches were asked the most in each state over the past five years.       Here's a look at the results that came back for Oregon and a couple of its neighboring states. Oregon The most disappointing part of the study is that it brought back only two results for Oregon: "How to hack wifi" and "How to make floral arrangements." Practical choices, for sure. Washington Washington's list was more comprehensive than Oregon's, with nine results, ranging from "How to use a French press" and "How to eat a fig" to "How to survive an earthquake" and "How to dab." California As you can imagine, California's was an eclectic list, including such queries as "How to play Stairway to Heaven," "How to rig an election," "How to get on Wheel of Fortune" and "How to ruin everything." Idaho Idahoans really wanted to know "How to address a letter" and "How to cook quinoa," among others. Nevada Zombies on the brain? What else could explain the search in Nevada for "How to survive a zombie apocalypse," "How to buy a gun" and "How to fight." Some of the other interesting popular queries around the country include "How to Google something" (Indiana), "How to join the Illuminati" (Arizona), "How to be a ninja" (Hawaii), "How to pass a drug test" (Kentucky and Tennessee), "How to tip cows" (New Hampshire), "How to give yourself a hickey" (New York), "How to spell 40" and "How to spell 90" (Texas), and "How to move to Canada" (Vermont).

Finance Search Tue, Nov 15, 2016, 11:05 AM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 4 hrs 55 mins Strong earnings boost stocks as markets eye ECBBy John Biers | AFP – Tue, Oct 18, 2016 11:30 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo London gained 0.8 percent following data that showed British annual inflation surged to a near two-year high of 1.0 percent in September, as a tumbling pound raised prices of imported goods and attracted tourists Global stocks rose Tuesday following a plethora of mostly good US corporate earnings and ahead of a European Central Bank meeting that is expected to keep monetary stimulus alive. In the US, the tech-rich Nasdaq fared especially well, with blowout results from Netflix lifting the on-demand television service by nearly 20 percent and positive reviews of Google's new smartphone boosting Google parent Alphabet to a new all-time high. "The Netflix news was taken pretty positively," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, adding that the balance of third-quarter earnings has been solid thus far. "Investors are increasingly believing that this will be the first quarter in five that we'll have earnings growth," Ablin said. Others in the US to report strong earnings included the health insurer UnitedHealth and Goldman Sachs, while IBM disappointed after reporting lower revenue for the 18th straight quarter. Bourses in both Paris and Frankfurt climbed more than one percent, with banking shares especially strong ahead of Thursday's ECB meeting. Some analysts expect the ECB to maintain current programs to spur growth and could open the door to additional stimulus in December. London gained 0.8 percent following data that showed British annual inflation surged to a near two-year high of 1.0 percent in September, as a tumbling pound raised prices of imported goods and attracted tourists. But on Tuesday, the pound pushed higher against the dollar and euro after British government lawyer James Eadie told Britain's High Court that Britain's parliament will "very likely" need to approve any official deal with the European Union following Brexit. That translated into "another delay for Brexit which has caused the pound to appreciate," said Stephen Simonis, chief currency consultant at FXDD Global. "Although no formal decision has been announced as of yet, reports of Parliament's involvement is positive for the currency as many members disapprove of a 'hard Brexit,'" said BK Asset Management analyst Kathy Lien. - Key figures at 2100 GMT - New York - DOW: UP 0.4 percent at 18,161,94 (close) New York - S&P 500: UP 0.6 percent at 2,139.60 (close) New York - Nasdaq: UP 0.9 percent to 5,243.84 (close) London - FTSE 100: UP 0.8 percent at 7,000.06 points (close) Frankfurt - DAX 30: UP 1.2 percent at 10,631.55 (close) Paris - CAC 40: UP 1.3 percent at 4,508.91 points (close) EURO STOXX 50: UP 1.3 percent at 3,046.99 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.4 percent at 16,963.61 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 1.6 percent at 23,394.39 (close) Shanghai - Composite: UP 1.4 percent at 3,083.88 (close) Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0979 from $1.1001 Monday Dollar/yen: DOWN at 103.87 yen from 103.88 yen Pound/dollar: UP at $1.2295 from $1.2182 Euro/pound: DOWN at 89.29 pence from 90.31 pence Oil - West Texas Intermediate: UP 35 cents at $50.29 per barrel Oil - Brent North Sea: UP 16 cents at $51.68 @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Sydney Airport gets new COOAAP Sydney Airport has appointed chief financial officer Hugh Wehby as the new chief operating officer from January … Trump to roll back Obama energy policiesAAP SEC Chair says to step down before term endsAFP German travel site trivago files for IPO in USAFP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7565 +0.0009 +0.12% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6046 +0.0002 +0.03% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.7038 +0.0007 +0.10% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Budget Rent a Car Salim Mehajer Travel insurance Pasquale Barbaro Online car insurance quote Julian Assange Free iTunes download NZ earthquake Currency Converter Stephen Bannon Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Oct 18, 2016 Share Tweet 0 Gathering Google search data from each state once again, Estately has created a map illustrating the most frequently searched how-to questions in each state. A previous map of searches from Estately in May showed the most Googled questions in each state.    Estately said it compiled the data by using Google Autocomplete to find the questions people most typed in the search bar. “We then ran those searches through Google Trends to determine which state queried each of these selected searches the most over the past 5 years,” Estately wrote in a post on its website. A map of the United States almost five months after Estately’s previous findings show the country has moved on from topical questions like "Can Sen. Bernie Sanders win?" and "Is Sen. Ted Cruz the Zodiac killer?" to queries about Pokémon Go. But the election is still on New Jersey voters’ minds, with the most frequently searched how-to question in that state being: “How to stop Trump?” We’re sure failed presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a frequent Trump surrogate, wouldn’t be too happy to hear what his constituents are searching.   Other standout state questions include Florida, which previously asked, “Why does everyone hate Florida?” (Maybe because it does things like this.) Floridians, seeming to have found the answer to their previous question, are now searching “How to get out of Florida?” instead. Good luck with that.   You can see Estately’s full findings here.

The results released Tuesday represented Yahoo’s first financial update since announcing in late July its deal to sell its digital operations to Verizon. The numbers showed Yahoo is profiting from a cost-cutting program that has jettisoned 2,200 workers, or about one-fifth of its workforce, during the past year. The Sunnyvale, California, company earned $163 million, or 17 cents per share, more than doubling from the same time last year. But Yahoo’s revenue plunged 14 per cent to $857 million after subtracting advertising commissions for the period covering July through September. It marks the fourth consecutive quarter that Yahoo’s net revenue has dropped by at least 10 per cent, a trend that management forecast will extend into the final three months of this year. ___ Google’s Pixel phone: Not much new, but still a standout NEW YORK (AP) — Google’s ambitious new smartphone, the Pixel, doesn’t offer a lot that’s new. Yet it’s still one of the best out there. Google achieves that by pulling together the best features from Apple, Samsung and other phone makers and offering them at prices comparable to iPhones — starting at about $650 for the regular, 5-inch model and $770 for the 5.5-inch “XL” edition. Both versions go on sale Thursday through Verizon, Best Buy and Google’s online store. The Pixel isn’t quite an iPhone replacement, as Google wants you to believe; hardware is just part of what makes an iPhone an iPhone. But it might serve up a strong challenge to Samsung, especially as people look for alternatives to the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. ___ US stocks rebound on strong company earnings; oil rises Surprisingly strong earnings from Netflix, UnitedHealth Group and other companies put investors in a buying mood Tuesday, driving U.S. stocks solidly higher. Health care stocks led the gainers. Materials, utilities and a broad swath of other companies also posted gains. Industrials and consumer-focused stocks notched the smallest gains. Energy stocks also rose as the price of crude oil recovered from an earlier slide. The rally wiped out the market’s losses from the day before. ___ $4 a month? Social Security recipients to get tiny increase WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of Social Security recipients and federal retirees will get a 0.3 per cent increase in monthly benefits next year, the fifth year in a row that older Americans will have to settle for historically low raises. The adjustment adds up to a monthly increase of less than $4 a month for an average recipient. The cost-of-living adjustment, announced by the government Tuesday, will affect more than 70 million people — about 1 in 5 Americans. For recipients, the average monthly Social Security payment now is $1,238. Unfortunately for some seniors, even the small increase will probably be wiped out by an expected increase in Medicare Part B premiums, which are usually deducted from Social Security payments. ___ Trading gains drive Goldman Sachs’ profits sharply higher NEW YORK (AP) — Goldman Sachs’ earnings soared in the third quarter, driven largely by trading and investment gains. The results easily surpassed analysts’ estimates. The New York-based bank said Tuesday that it earned $2.1 billion, or $4.88 per share, up from $1.33 billion, or $2.90 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Wall Street analysts were expecting Goldman to earn $3.82 a share, according to FactSet. While the firm’s investment banking division reported flat revenue, a reflection of the fact fewer companies did deals in the quarter, Goldman’s trading desks and the division where it invests its own money did exceptionally well. Revenue in Goldman’s fixed income, currencies and commodities division jumped 34 per cent to $1.96 billion. Goldman benefited from similar forces that helped boost trading of other major Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America. ___ A surprisingly high number of first-timers now buying homes WASHINGTON (AP) — For years, the U.S. housing market looked bleak for young couples hoping to buy their first homes but struggling with high student debt, low pay and meagre down-payment savings. But a new survey by the real estate firm Zillow suggests that first-time buyers may be entering the market in greater numbers than industry watchers had assumed. Over the past year, the survey found, nearly half of home sales have gone to first-timers. That’s a much higher proportion than some other industry estimates had indicated. And it comes as a surprise in part because ownership rates for adults under 34 are at their lowest levels since the government began tracking the figure in 1994. ___ Gov’t announces new steps to protect airline consumers WASHINGTON (AP) — Airlines would be required to refund fees when checked bags are “substantially delayed” under a proposal released Tuesday by the Transportation Department, one of a series of steps the Obama administration says it’s taking to boost consumer protections for passengers. The government already requires airlines to refund fees for bags that are lost, but the proposal would go a step further by including delayed bags. Transportation officials said they haven’t yet defined what constitutes a substantial delay. ___ US consumer prices rose in September on higher oil costs WASHINGTON (AP) — Higher energy costs fueled U.S. consumer prices in September, but overall inflation remained in check as it has for the past several years. The Labor Department said Tuesday that consumer prices increased 0.3 per cent last month. Much of that rise stemmed from energy, housing and prescription drugs. Energy costs surged 2.9 per cent in September as oil and gasoline prices rebounded from recent lows. Previous price declines still mean that gas costs 6.4 per cent less than a year ago. Inflation has stayed relatively low despite job growth that has brought more workers into the economy. Until last month, the modest levels of inflation largely came from muted oil prices and a stronger dollar. ___ US homebuilders’ confidence eases slightly U.S. homebuilders’ confidence eased this month after surging to the highest level in nearly a year in September. Even so, builders remain optimistic overall about sales growth in months ahead, a reflection of how steady job gains are leading more Americans to buy newly built homes. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Tuesday fell two points this month to 63 following a reading of 65 in September. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has held above 60 the past two months after hovering at 58 earlier this year. ___ Foreign holdings of US Treasury securities fell in August WASHINGTON (AP) — Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities fell again in August as China, the biggest foreign owner of Treasury debt, trimmed its holdings for the third straight month. The Treasury Department reported Tuesday that total foreign holdings dropped 0.8 per cent to $6.20 trillion in August following a 0.5 per cent decline in July. China reduced its holdings 2.7 per cent to $1.19 trillion after declines of 1.8 per cent in July and 0.3 per cent in June. Japan, the second largest foreign holder of Treasury debt, reduced its holdings by 0.9 per cent to $1.14 trillion in August. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gained 75.54 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 18,161.94. Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 13.10 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 2,139.60. The Nasdaq composite index added 44.01 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 5,243.84. U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 35 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to close at $50.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 16 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to close at $51.68 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline inched up a penny to $1.51 a gallon. Heating oil was little changed at $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas rose 2 cents to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

While that’s great news for tech evangelists, it’s a potential source of more confusion than excitement for your average consumer, whose knowledge of smart home “ecosystems” is often obscured by the increasing number of options out there. That’s where we come in. From price to compatibility and, of course, style, here are the details on the offerings from Apple, Amazon, and Google: how they differ, how much they cost, and all the basics you need to know. Want more info on how to make your home a smart one? Check out our guide to doing just that. Amazon Echo The Amazon Echo Photo via Amazon When Amazon entered the smart home ecosystem fray in November of 2014, it made quite an impression. For one, the Amazon Echo is a Bluetooth-connected speaker that also plays music from Spotify and Pandora. But Echo went beyond the usual automated-control-of-lights-and-HVAC home tech paradigm with a voice-activated virtual assistant, Alexa, that can turn on the news, set alarms, give users intel on the day’s weather, and answer simple questions like “How many ounces are in a cup?” The Echo hub—a cylindrical, nearly 9.5-inch-tall unit with a black case and blue indicator lights—has a darker, moodier aesthetic than most of the Wall-E-style, white-and-silver home tech products out there, which also helps set it apart. While many consumers want a device that fades into the background, the Echo offers a similarly unobtrusive unit with a different look. Amazon’s Echo Dot Photo via Flickr Amazon announced a more compact version of the Echo, the Echo Dot, last spring, and though the smaller device costs a bit less, it still plays music (at lower quality and volume) and can be given voice commands. Who’s it good for? The Echo is a good option for music fans who also want the smart home experience and are down with trying voice-activated smart home interfaces. The brass tacks: The Echo starts at $179.99, and consumers can purchase it online at Amazon.com or at retail stores like Best Buy. The Echo Dot, which is only available for purchase with an Alexa device like the original Echo or Amazon Tap, retails at half the price of its older sibling, for $89.99. There’s an Echo app for both iOS and Android devices. Apple HomeKit Apple’s Home app was a centerpiece of this year’s WWDC conference. Photo via The Verge When Apple HomeKit was announced in 2014, there simply weren’t many compatible products available—as our sister site The Verge pointed out. Now that the requisite thermostats, door locks, and lightbulbs are, in fact, on the market and available to consumers, the new Home app rolled out with iOS 10 is great as a one-stop shop for toggling said lights on and off, checking the temperature in your home, and operating heating and cooling systems—or your home’s security cameras—remotely. Unlike Google Home and Amazon Echo, Apple HomeKit isn’t trying to sell consumers on a new, physical hub. There are some benefits there: Your existing, iOS 10-equipped iDevice (including iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, or Apple TVs) can serve as the nexus for your intelligent apartment through the Home app and with voice activation commands to Siri, the longtime virtual assistant available with Apple devices. This means you can stock up on all the HomeKit-compatible products you want and simply make sure your devices’ operating systems are up to date. Who’s it good for? Apple HomeKit is the choice for iPeople—folks who already have iOS 10-equipped or iOS 10-ready mobile devices (that’s a lot of us) or a new Apple TV from the company. If you primarily use an Android device, HomeKit likely isn’t the best option for you. The brass tacks: The Home app comes standard with iOS 10 on any Apple mobile device. You can purchase Apple devices capable of launching the Home app at the Apple website or at an Apple retail shop. Google Home Photo via Google You can already preorder Google Home, which ships to the public early next month (on November 4). Home is a direct competitor to Amazon Echo: Home, too, is voice activated (“OK Google”), can play music (from your Google Play, Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora, or TuneIn account), set alarms, spout dictionary definitions, and, of course, control lights and thermostats. For now, Google Home doesn’t work with nearly as many home tech products as Amazon Echo—which supports nearly 300 services—but expanded compatibility is likely to come with time. For now, Home works with some of the most prominent smart home companies, like Nest, IFTTT, Philips Hue, and anything SmartThings-branded. And, if you already use a Google Chromecast, you’re good to go there, too. Who’s it good for? Google Home is great for people trying to save 50 bucks (it will retail for $129.99, compared to Amazon Echo’s $179.99) and folks who dig the customizable, colorful speaker grilles available for each unit. It’s also fine for those who don’t mind the rather limited number of products it’s compatible with (at least for now). The brass tacks: Google Home is available for preorder now for $129.99 and will start shipping early next month.

Tap Install. Tap Accept. Allow the installation to complete. Once the installation is finished, tap your device's home button and then tap the entry for Action Launcher 3. You can tap either Always (to set Action Launcher as your default) or Just This Once (to test it out). When Action Launcher first starts, you will be greeted with a welcome screen that I highly recommend you read because it covers all of Action Launcher's features. The two standout features I won't go through a standard explanation of the features included with Action Launcher; instead, I'll highlight the two features that I think will compel you to make Action Launcher your default home screen launcher. I will demonstrate Action Launcher on the fantastic OnePlus 3, running Android 6.0.1. Covers Covers is Action Launcher's most impressive feature. The standard Android home screen allows you to combine icons together to create a folder. You tap that folder to open it and then tap to launch the app you want to use. With Action Launcher, you can convert those folders to Covers. A Cover offers two actions: Tap the cover to launch the default Cover app Swipe up to open the Cover and reveal all the apps within To create Covers, combine your launchers to create a folder. Tap the folder open it, and then tap the three vertical dots in the bottom right corner of the folder (Figure A). Figure A Image: Jack Wallen Creating a cover from a folder. Tap Make Cover, and the folder will be converted to a Cover. When you do this, the Cover icon will switch to the default Cover app. Swipe up from the Cover icon to reveal all the apps within or tap the Cover to launch the default app. To set the default app, swipe up to open the Cover and then long press and drag the app you want to use as the default to the upper left corner of the Cover. Once that app launcher is set in the upper left corner, it will be the app launched when you tap the Cover icon. Shutters Shutters is the other feature that might have you drooling for Action Launcher. It's only available in the Plus version, but it's very much worth the cost of admission. Here's how Shutters work: When you swipe upward from an app icon, the app's widget is revealed (Figure B), making it incredibly easy to interact with certain apps, right from within a Cover or a Folder. Figure B A Shutter for Facebook Messenger. There are a couple of things you should know about Shutters. First, not all apps are Shutter-enabled by default. When you open a Folder or a Cover, if you see two horizontal bars on an app (Figure C), that app is Shutter-enabled. Figure C Image: Jack Wallen Apps within a Cover that are Shutter-enabled. The next thing you need to know is that, even if an app isn't Shutter-enabled by default, for most apps, you can swipe upward on the launcher and allow Action Launcher to enable it for Shutter. Test the feature on those apps without the indicating bars and see if it will work. There's more where that came from Action Launcher contains quite a lot of goodness, but the Covers and Shutters features should have you running directly to the Google Play Store, installing this amazing home screen launcher, and setting it as your default. Once you've purchased the Plus version, you'll find so much more to love about Action Launcher, you'll wonder why it hasn't been your default all along.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A political weather map of America would show Wall Street under a cloud, and Silicon Valley bathed in sunshine. Over the Obama administration’s eight years, the technology industry has embedded itself in Washington. The president hung out with Facebook Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg and hired the government’s first chief tech officer. At least at the lower levels of officialdom, the revolving door with companies such as Google is spinning ever faster -- as it once did with Wall Street. Politicians have played down their connections to finance since the taxpayer bailout of 2008. No such stigma attaches to tech, for now. But as the Valley steps up its lobbying efforts, with a wish-list that ranges from immigration to rules for driverless cars, some critics warn that similar traps lie in wait: It’s not easy for the government to police an industry from which it poaches talent and solicits help with writing laws. “If you’re trying to influence government policy on behalf of a corporate sector, it’s not better that you do it for the tech industry than for Goldman,” said Jeff Hauser from the Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington. Hauser heads the Revolving Door Project, which scrutinizes political appointees. Even amid mounting concern over inequality, he says wealthy tech executives and their companies are still considered cool. In other words: It may be hard to persuade people these days that what’s good for Goldman Sachs is good for America -- but it might just work for Google. The five biggest U.S. tech companies are now the five biggest companies, period -- at least as measured by market value. And they’re flexing that financial muscle. The tech firms spent $49 million on Washington lobbyists last year, while the five largest banks shelled out $19.7 million, data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics shows. On the personnel front, the Campaign for Accountability, a non-profit group, studied the to-and-fro between government and Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc. It found that 183 people who worked under President Barack Obama through last year were hired by Google, while 58 headed the other way. Google is in Washington to “help policy makers understand our business and the work we do to keep the internet open and fuel economic growth,” the Mountain View, California-based company said by e-mail in response to questions. Facebook’s goals in the capital include protecting customers, “explaining how our service works, and maintaining an open Internet and a culture of innovation,” it said in an e-mail. There have been other high-profile moves out of Washington: former Attorney General Eric Holder this year took a job at Airbnb Inc., and David Plouffe, Obama’s one-time campaign manager, started at Uber Technologies Inc. in 2014. Persistent rumors have linked Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg with the post of Treasury secretary in a Hillary Clinton administration. Sandberg, a former chief of staff at the Treasury under Larry Summers, told a conference this month that she plans to stay at Facebook. Apple Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Microsoft Corp.’s founder Bill Gates were on a list of Clinton’s potential vice-presidential nominees, according to an e-mail allegedly from her campaign chair that was released by Wikileaks. The administration’s view is that tech people are welcome in Washington because they can help make things work better -- and help is certainly needed. Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary, says the government is shifting toward using technology the way business has been doing for years. It has set up a coding boot-camp for employees, while data scientists work across federal agencies to mine the archives and help improve transportation projects. ‘Data as Currency’ “We view data as currency,” Pritzker said in an interview. She travels to Silicon Valley at least once a quarter and has an advisory council of 21 tech experts. Megan Smith, the former Google manager who took a job as Obama’s chief technology officer in 2014, says the long-term goal is to make government services as smooth a user experience as that offered by, say, Amazon or Dropbox. Collaboration with tech companies pre-dates Obama’s creation of a special post to oversee it. Zillow Group Inc., the real-estate website, helped the Treasury after the housing-market collapse, according to Stan Humphries, its chief analytics officer. “I was struck by how little data the government had” in areas such as price indexes or foreclosures, Humphries said. The Seattle-based firm filled the gap, offering its micro-data to Federal Reserve researchers and even, on occasion, to Neel Kashkari, then an assistant secretary at the Treasury department and now in charge of the Minneapolis Fed. “They were soon sucking up every bit of data that we had available,” said Humphries. Biggest Fear In Washington, favors typically come at a price though. Tech giants, which are in the habit of buying up smaller companies and also trying to tie customers to their own platforms, keep a close watch on antitrust policy. In 2013, Google -- like Microsoft before it -- was threatened with a potentially costly legal battle. Federal Trade Commission staff said the company “unlawfully maintained its monopoly” over internet searches, though the 20-month probe was eventually closed. “Competition policy, that’s the thing they’re most scared of,” said Barry Lynn, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, a Washington think-tank. “If a Microsoft-style case was brought against any of these companies, it could totally change their business prospects. It could result in radical changes to the scale and structure of their corporations.” Cases have been opened in Europe against Google and Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, said Lynn. He’s a Republican, showing that concern about the growing power of the tech giants isn’t confined to the political left. Not that the left doesn’t share it. Clinton has talked about tougher antitrust laws aimed at ending the “abuse of economic power” by corporations. ‘Their Damn Computers’ She’s also taken aim at their shifting of profits overseas to avoid taxes. Hauser, who worked at the Justice Department’s antitrust division before joining the Revolving Door Project, said tech firms “are at the leading edge of tax avoidance because of the ways they’ve perfected moving their intellectual property overseas.” He said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew’s support for Apple, after the iPhone-maker was ordered to pay back-taxes in Europe, is an unprecedented stance for a Democratic administration. Clinton’s Republican rival Donald Trump proposed a tax cut for companies that repatriate profits, though it didn’t win him many converts in the tech industry. Then there’s the labor market. Trump has taken aim at Apple among other companies that have shifted jobs overseas. “We’re going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country,” he said in January. But the iPhone-maker announced this month it’s setting up a second R&D center in China. Big tech simply doesn’t hire on the same scale as its heavy-industry predecessors. And technology is reshaping the workforce in other ways too, with Silicon Valley favorites like Uber and Taskrabbit Inc. at the forefront. They’re central to the growth of a gig economy that’s spurred calls for rules on health-care and employment insurance to be updated. Tech companies also typically back immigration rights for skilled labor that have become politically toxic, and they support trade accords that both presidential candidates oppose. They’ve clashed with the government over the balance between internet privacy and national security, notably when Apple boss Cook refused to help unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. Beyond the shopping-list of specifics, says Lynn, the industry has one overarching desire: light-touch regulation. “They want to be left alone,” he said. “They want to be allowed to do what they want to do.” And to keep Washington at arm’s length, it helps to get close to it first.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

Mobile users will be able to receive updates on when prices will increase while also finding hotel deals on their smartphone. When it comes to flight information, users can select the flight of their choice to learn more about prices. A notification may pop up to alert the consumer on when the fare will expire and how much they can save. And when generally looking up routes, without having selected a specific flight, users can see a notification bar with “multiple tips showing how to find the best price for this route.” These tips can vary from alternate dates to other local airports offering lower rates. It can also include a tip on an “expected price jump” based on past rates and selecting the notification will provide more information regarding price hikes and when it will likely take place. Google rolled out an update for its Google Flights feature ahead of the holiday season. Photo: Google “Google Flights can now help you be more confident that you’re booking your flight at the right time to get the best price,” wrote Nabil Naghdy, product manager of Google Flights, in a blog post. “We now show you when prices are expected to increase for some specific flights and routes you’re interested in.” Users can also opt for tracking a specific flight and receiving updates via email on prices and expected changes in fare. According to Google: “Fare expiration and expected price jump notifications will be rolling out over the coming weeks everywhere Google Flights is available.” Additionally, Google is making changes to its hotel search function. The platform already alerts deals that are lower than usual pricing. Now, users can filter to search for hotel deals exclusively by tapping the upper left corner and filtering for “Deals.” It will also alert consumers for when loyalty members will be eligible for special savings.

On Sept. 29, the search giant began publishing a new website that uses the .google, rather than the standard .com, as its domain name. The new site, blog.google, consolidates 19 previously separate Google blogs. Google’s website is at the fore of an expected boom in websites taking advantage of a two-year-old change in internet rules that lifted the limits for these suffixes, called top-level domains. That’s brought .paris, .movie and .xyz to websites and email addresses. The new rules also can give brand names new prominence in internet addresses. Many companies have requested and received approval to use domain names including .kindle, .apple, .ibm, .canon and .samsung. And it’s not just tech. Also approved are .ford, .homedepot, .delta, .nike, .hbo, .statefarm, .oldnavy and .mcdonalds. Use of new top-level domains is growing, with about 25 million registered for use so far. Greensec GreenSecApproval, of course, is just a first step. It’s not clear how enthusiastic most companies will be about the new names. So far, Google is the eager beaver. “While we’re exploring other ways to use .google, we simply think blog.google is a fun way to use our own branded domain,” spokeswoman Andrea Faville said Monday. The company brought the blogs together on a new central site, the Keyword, three weeks ago. Early excitement around branded domains has cooled, said Tom Sepanski, a director of naming and verbal identity work for branding consultancy Landor Associates. Web addresses are “featuring less and less into the overall branding profile,” he said. “There are so many ways of engaging -- Twitter, Instagram, social media, search engines where you can just plug in the brand.” Sticker shock What’s fun for Google is a daunting financial commitment to others. A $185,000 application fee and annual $30,000 operation fee will keep mom-and-pop shops away from their own domains. Play Video CBSN Google launches tools to give users voting info Early voting has already started in many states and Google has launched new tools to make it easier for users to attain information about voting.... Still, plenty of businesses other than Google see the new domain names as a good investment. Branded domains can add distinction to an internet address, and renting out generic top-level domain (GTLD) names can potentially be a lucrative business. At a January auction, GMO Registry bid $41.5 million to win rights to sell .shop domain names. And in July, Nu Dot Co won .web with a bid of $135 million. Where does all the money go? To a nonprofit organization called ICANN -- the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. The organization oversees internet plumbing on behalf of companies, governments and universities, as well as the general public. You might have heard of ICANN recently -- it was in the headlines as part of a political battle that pitted Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump against the White House. Easing opposition Many brand holders vociferously opposed the expansion of domain names, but that didn’t stop them from signing up. Play Video CBSN Tech giants team up for artificial intelligence alliance Some of the biggest tech giants in the country, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and IBM, are teaming up to get ahead of the curve on artifici... “Once the applications were in, the number of brands that actually had applied for a new GTLD surprised everyone in the domain name industry,” said David Taylor, a Hogan Lovells attorney who handles brand issues and is a member of ICANN’s committee for competition, consumer choice and consumer trust. Of the original 1,930 applications for generic top-level domains, 246 were branded, Taylor said. “The general feeling from our clients that have applied is that it was a worthwhile exercise,” he said. Right now ICANN isn’t accepting new applications, but the window will open again, said ICANN spokesman James Cole. Exact timing is up to the ICANN community -- eight organizations and advisory committees representing industry, governments and the general public. Right now that community is reviewing the current GTLD process to see what can be improved, Taylor said. Millions raised in auction ICANN has been raking in money from the new domain names -- more than $233 million so far -- but under its own rules it is only allowed to use the money to cover the program’s costs. The organization hasn’t yet said what it will do with the extra money. However, it did say it’ll work with its community to figure it out transparently. Possibilities, according to the applicant guidebook for the GTLD program, include grants to lower the costs of signing up for a new domain name or research to improve the internet’s security and stability. If you want to have a say, you can join ICANN’s At-Large Advisory Committee. Landor’s Sepanski said enthusiasm for branded domain names could bloom as they become more common. “As bigger brands adopt them and use them effectively, you might see a tipping point where it becomes a necessary thing to do,” he said. “I don’t think we’re there yet.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

In this guide, we’ll help you pack for the trip and serve up a few tips to help the transition go smoothly. Breaking free of Google’s ecosystem and its team of manufacturers will present a few difficulties, sure, but we can find solutions. Related: New to the iOS ecosystem? Here are 100 of our favorite apps for the iPhone We’ll run through how to transfer your contacts, move your precious music, videos, photos, and find equivalent services on iOS to replace what you’re leaving behind. We’ll also help you find your feet with some tips, and show you how to get the best out of your newfangled iPhone. Let’s begin! What you’re leaving behind As you prepare to abandon Android, it’s worth considering what you can’t take with you. Your phone case is not going to be compatible with your new iPhone, and your dock might not be either, but there’s a good chance that any other Android accessories you bought will be. If they rely on Bluetooth to connect, then they’ll work just fine with the iPhone. Most speaker accessories and docks have iPhone compatibility as standard. Even traditional headphones will work with the latest iPhone, as it comes with a handy Lightning to 3.5 mm adapter. You obviously can’t take your Android apps with you, but there are lots of great options on iOS, so you’ll be able to replace the vast majority. Wave goodbye to home screen customization, you won’t really find it on iOS. Last, but not least, there’s the question of what to do with your old phone. Your best bet might be to wipe it and sell it, because you’ll need some cash for that new iPhone. Transferring contacts Naturally you’ll want to take your contacts with you, and there are various ways you can do that. Start with this guide on how to transfer your contacts between iPhone and Android, and you’ll find it’s easy to handle the process using Gmail and iTunes, in case you need to do that. Please enable Javascript to watch this video Switching from Google to Apple services When we covered how to switch from iPhone to Android, we discussed all the Google services that you might consider using in order to replace Apple’s offerings, but going the other way is a lot easier because the Google services you’ve been using on Android are all available on iOS as well. You can find a complete list on this Google page. Google Maps, Chrome, Google Play Music, Google Drive, and even Google Now (available through the Google Search app), among other things, can all be enjoyed on iOS. They might work a little differently from their Android counterparts, but if you’re heavily invested in using any of them, then their presence on iOS should certainly help you feel at home. Apple iPhone 7More Of course, there are still many Apple alternatives and they’ll be set as the default options on your new iPhone. You’ll want to try out: iTunes: Good for buying and organizing your music, movies, TV shows, apps, audiobooks, and more Safari Web browser: Can sync bookmarks across all your Apple devices iCloud: Can back up your files, contacts, calendars, and photos There’s also the Maps app for turn-by-turn directions, and a lot of premium optional extras. Creative people will want to try iMovie and GarageBand. Workaholics will love Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. There’s also iBooks for reading, and then there’s the largest collection of free education content available through iTunes U. Moving photos, videos, and music Read More Backing up your precious memories is vital. We took a look at how to back up, speed up, and clean up your iPhone or Android device, so you might want to start there. If you’d like to copy files over a wired connection, then plug your Android phone into your computer using your Micro USB to USB cable. Pull down the Notification shade on your Android phone, and make sure it’s connected. It should connect automatically in Media transfer mode (MTP). You should get a pop-up on your PC, which will give various options including Open device to view files. Alternatively you can go to Start > Computer, and you should find it listed. Navigate to the files you want, and drag and drop them onto your computer. Here’s how to transfer files from an Android phone to a Mac. To get files from your computer to your iPhone, you can plug your iPhone in and fire up iTunes. Select your device in the left panel in iTunes, click the Apps tab, and then scroll down to find the File Sharing section (if you don’t have a file sharing section, your iPhone has no file sharing apps installed). Choose the app you want to transfer the file to, and then drag and drop the file from your computer into iTunes onto the space on the right. Apple iPhone 7 PlusMore If you want to transfer all your photos, first make sure that any new photos you have on your iPhone are backed up, then go and select your device in iTunes again, and select the Photos tab up top. Make sure the Sync Photos box is ticked and tap on the drop down menu to choose the Copy files from folder. Now pick the folder of photos you want to transfer. Be warned: You may lose any photos you have on the iPhone when you do this, so back up first. Going wireless and using the cloud to transfer files can prove a whole lot easier. You could log in and use iCloud, but remember you only get 5GB for free. You can always bolster it with Google Drive, Google Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, DropBox, or another cloud service. You can access any movies, music, or books that you bought through Google Play through the browser on your iPhone, or by downloading the right Google iOS app. For example, if you’ve been using Google Play Books on Android, you just download the Google Play Books app for iOS and your collection is instantly accessible. If you’ve been backing up files on Google Drive or uploading photos to Google Photos, then you can do the same thing – snag the iOS apps and you have instant easy access to sync them across. It’s easy to transfer files using other cloud solutions. Most of the big names, like Dropbox, have Android and iOS apps, so simply download the iOS app, enter your account details, and copy across whatever you need. It makes sense to import your music into iTunes, and it’s easily done. Make sure you have the Music Manager for Google Play Music installed on your computer, or Google Play Music installed to your Chrome browser, and select Download my library from the Download tab. Choose the folder you want to download to and then fire up iTunes and go to File > Add Folder to Library, choose the same folder, and it will all be copied across. Once you have all your music in iTunes, check out our guide on how to download music to your iPod or iPhone. Moving your text messages It’s often a wrench to leave behind your old text messages when you switch to a new phone. Most of them won’t be missed, but sometimes you’ll have a special goodbye or a romantic message that you want to keep. Fortunately, there’s an app that makes this less of an issue, and it comes straight from Apple. Appropriately called Move to iOS, this free app will transfer your Contacts, Message history, photos, videos, Mail accounts, and other data you might want to keep. Welcome to iOS At first glance, it’s bound to look strange around these parts, and there are some things you’ll probably miss about Android, but iOS is designed to be intuitive, so you shouldn’t have too much trouble settling in. Let’s see if we can make it as soft a landing as possible. Finding your way The first thing you’re going to notice is the lack of a Back or Task switcher button. All you’ve got is the solitary Home button, which always takes you back to your home screen. In general, any back options will show up at the top left of the screen; otherwise tap that Home button to reverse out of an app. You open up recent apps or multitasking by tapping the Home button twice. You can also hold the Home button down to launch Siri. You can ask questions, get directions, set up appointments, and more.You can ask questions, get directions, set up appointments, and more. For settings, you’ll have to look in individual app menus, or try the Settings app. You’ll find that the pull-down Notifications bar is familiar to Android, but by default notifications will show up on your lock screen as well. You can always change this in Settings > Notifications. Just remember that if you tap or swipe on the notification it will probably open the relevant app. You have to tap the small cross at the top right to dismiss a notification. Some pop-up notifications do offer interactions now, so you can dismiss a notification or write a quick reply without leaving the app you’re in. You can also add widgets to the Notification center. Swipe down from the top or swipe right to open it, and then tap Edit to see what your choices are. apple-iphone-6-plus-review-notificationsMore Customization Your home screen in iOS is basically like your app drawer on Android – it’s just a list of all your apps. You can scroll right to access further home screen pages. You can tap and hold on an app to move or delete the icon. If you want to create a folder then drag it on top of another app icon and drop it. Setting your iPhone wallpaper is easy. Go into the Settings app, choose Wallpaper, and then select the image you want to use. If you want to make one yourself, the iPhone 7 has a resolution of 1,334 x 750 pixels, but you might want to make it slightly larger (1,592 x 893 pixels) to account for the parallax effect. For ringtones you can choose whatever you like, or make your own. Check out our how to make ringtones for iPhone guide to get the lowdown on that. Apps The selection of apps and games on iOS is excellent. All of the big name apps that you were used to on Android will be easy to find in Apple’s App Store. We’ve got a big list of the best iPhone apps and the best iPhone games to get you started. top-5-best-iphone-games-adventure-times-puzzle-questMore Software updates iPhones are the best devices if you like to get operating system updates. You’ll be glad to leave Android and Windows Phone behind in this respect. All updates for those devices have to go through wireless carriers before they’re approved, a process that takes months. With the iPhone, updates are universal and easy to apply. Older models might not support the latest software, so iOS is not entirely free of fragmentation, but it’s certainly much less of an issue. You have the option to do it wirelessly via Settings > General > Software Update, or you can plug it in and do it through iTunes. To get the most out of iOS 10, the latest version of iOS, here are a handful of useful iOS 10 tips. Battery life Apple works hard on battery life for the iPhone and some users report that their juice keeps on flowing for longer than it does on some Android flagship phones (this is highly debatable). You may miss home screen widgets, but at least there’s a reduced drain on the battery without them. Whether you find an improvement, or not, most of you are probably going to want to find ways of maximizing that iPhone battery life. Apple iPhone 7 PlusMore Extra iPhone options and tips We’ve got some handy iPhone 7 tips and tricks to help you get started with your new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. If you decided to save some cash and go for an older model, then start with our iPhone 6S tips or iPhone 6 tips.

Tony Abbott reiterated the point he made to Katharine Murphy last night – that the reason he put a sunset clause on the Adler import ban was due to “internal pressure” rather than Leyonhjelm. Treasury secretary John Fraser acknowledged the growing intergenerational inequality gap otherwise known as the avocado scandal. Bill Shorten had to tidy up some loose remarks about loving only some of his team. And estimates continue ... I will leave it there for the day.

Hanson’s visit on Tuesday will mark the first time a crossbench or opposition senator or MP has been to the island following the Australian parliament’s decision last May to abolish its system of self-governance. Now Hanson wants to dismiss the island’s administrator, Gary Hargrave, a former Howard minister, on the grounds of “serious misconduct”. Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) BREAKING: The results of my Norfolk Island fact finding mission. I have written to the PM because the Administrator should be sacked #auspol pic.twitter.com/JtjCUC7tq7 October 19, 2016 Updated at 2.31am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.05am EDT 02:05 Just a couple more things on the Adler. By putting the gun thing back on the table, David Leyonjhelm has opened up a further issue for Malcolm Turnbull with his Coalition partner, Barnaby Joyce. Not that Joyce has disagreed with Turnbull’s messages. But his National MPs have tried to remind everyone that this is a matter of categorisation of the gun - not the import. Because a number of the shotguns are already in the country. It looks like a Lib-Nat split. Tony Abbott’s revelation that the sunset clause on the import ban was a result of internal pressure from the National party and presumably some Libs, rather than Leyonhjelm, reinforces the “split” story for the PM. Nationals have confirmed they did push back on Abbott. Whether Keenan plus Dutton independently used the agreed sunset clause to barter with Leyonhjelm (given it was going to happen anyway) or whether Abbott gave permission to do so, we don’t know. So if the import ban is lifted – as at least some of the Nats would like – it will be painted as a watering down of the gun laws. Even though strictly speaking, it is not. It will also be painted as a win for the Nats over Turnbull. Enter WA premier Colin Barnett. He has said this: I’m far from being an expert on guns, but as a matter of policy, I do not support that gun. I saw some footage on television of it being fired; it’s obviously got a rapid-fire capacity. Australia has put in policies to contain gun ownership and use, and I do not support allowing a weapon like that into this state. If Barnett is going to be a hold-out on the Adler, it may be the best political outcome for Turnbull. It could both fix the wider political issue and his issue with the Nats. If the states cannot decide on the category – as they are required to do under the National Firearms Agreement – the import ban stays for the time being. This would solve the wider political problem by kicking it off into the long grass. The PM can tell the Nats his hands are tied by the states indecision – that is the condition of the Howard laws. As an aside, shooters who favour the import of the Adler are privately pretty ropable with Leyonjhelm. He has put the Adler squarely in the middle of a wider political debate, ensuring it will not be discussed in any sort of rational way. But Leyonjhelm wins either way. If the shotgun is permanently banned, he fought the good fight for shooters. If the ban is lifted, it was all because of him. The art of politics.

The high cost prostheses, which includes devices like pacemakers and replacement hips and knees, are currently being passed on to private patients through rising insurance premiums. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.58am EDT 00:58 Wayne Swan v BHP: Part four - the dummy spit You may remember last week Wayne Swan tore strips off BHP regarding their tax affairs last week. From our friends at AAP: Former treasurer Wayne Swan has accused BHP Billiton of a “dummy spit” over criticism of its tax affairs. The mining giant’s chief executive Andrew Mackenzie told a function in London on Monday the “continual questioning of our economic and social contribution” in Australia was “chilling” when compared to countries such as Chile. Mackenzie said the president of Chile, where BHP owns 57.5% of the Escondida copper mine, had recently praised the company’s economic and social contribution. But in our home country of Australia where we have contributed hugely to employment, and through taxes and royalties, we still find ourselves blamed for problems that we didn’t cause and the target, if you like, of people who assume that we are the ones trying to avoid tax. Swan told parliament on Wednesday BHP could not claim to be transparent over its tax affairs “given their failure to clearly outline numerous back payments to the Australian taxation office as a result of tax audits over a decade”. BHP are like that guest at the hotel. They have rented the penthouse, they have had full room service, but then they run off and leave a bill because they only paid for a standard room. The dummy spit by BHP executives in London last night is yet another example of how out of touch corporates are with ordinary people and why, around the world, many corporates are held in such low regard.

Facebook is diversifying beyond advertising with big investments in AI, messaging, and virtual reality. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 18, 2016 at 4:18PM Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) core business model is fairly easy to understand. It generates most of its revenue from targeted ads, which are customized from data mined from its users' social interactions. That business has been booming, boosting Facebook's revenue by 58% in 2014 and 44% in 2015.  Image source: Pixabay. But further ahead, we can see that Facebook is expanding into new markets to become much more than a social network. Let's examine three of the most exciting opportunities and how they could help Facebook evolve over the next few years. 1. Artificial intelligence Facebook's FAIR (Facebook AI Research) division develops tools for image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, real-time translation tools, machine learning, and other AI-related tasks. These features help Facebook better understand what it "sees" in users' posts, photos, videos, and social interactions -- allowing it to make "smarter" products for data mining and targeted advertising. Earlier this year, Facebook integrated chatbots directly into its stand-alone Messenger app. These bots enable customers to have automated conversations with customers instead of using traditional apps. Facebook is also expanding the same technology into smart homes with Jarvis, an upcoming in-home AI assistant that could be similar to Amazon's Echo. Facebook's AI efforts are aimed at disrupting Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dominance of the internet with its top search engines, browsers, and mobile operating systems. Instead of competing against Alphabet's Google in those markets to mine data, Facebook is simply improving the tools for mining the data of its 1.7 billion monthly active users. The better those tools become, the more relevant Facebook's ads become when compared to Google's search-based ads. 2. Facebook Messenger Facebook's decision to force users to install the stand-alone Messenger app was controversial at first, but it was necessary to expand its abilities as a stand-alone platform. Taking a cue from monolithic Asian chat apps like Line and Tencent's WeChat, Facebook added stickers, apps, mobile payments, chatbots, and group chats to the app. Image source: Google Play. Facebook also introduced Messenger for Business, which enables companies to open a live customer service chat channel to address problems. Businesses can choose whether they want a human customer service or chatbot on the other end. Customers can also use the channel to receive shipping notifications for incoming orders. It also launched M, a Siri-like assistant for Messenger, last year. Facebook even lets users sign up for Messenger without a Facebook account -- which helps it tether users who are only interested in sending and receiving messages to its ecosystem. Messenger already has over 1 billion monthly active users, so expanding the app's reach could unlock new sources of fresh revenue. 3. Virtual reality Two years ago, Facebook acquired Oculus VR for $2 billion. Earlier this year, it launched the Oculus Rift, the company's eagerly anticipated VR headset for PCs. Unfortunately, a recent Steam survey found that just 0.1% of its users owned a Rift, likely due to its $600 price tag, high PC requirements, and and limited software library. However, CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- who once called VR the "next major computing and communication platform" -- has some ambitious long-term plans. Oculus Home. Image source: Oculus VR. Oculus Home -- the device's app, video, and content portal -- already generates revenue for Facebook via a 30% cut of all sales. Several social games, which allow Oculus users to play VR games with each other, offer us a glimpse at how Facebook users might eventually visit each other's profiles in VR. Oculus Story Studio, its in-house VR movie studio, recently won an Emmy with its animated VR short Henry. Zuckerberg once suggested that in the future, people might be "enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world, or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home." If that happens, Facebook would certainly have a first mover's advantage in this fledgling market. The bottom line AI, Messenger, and VR all represent key ways that Facebook could evolve into a diversified tech giant. That growth trajectory indicates that even though Facebook shares have soared 230% since its IPO in May 2012, it could still have a lot of room to run over the next few years.

(Photo: Register file photo)Buy Photo What do you do when you want to know how to do something? Google it, of course. It's the one place we can ask whatever questions we want without fear of judgment. How to iron a shirt? You don't have to call your mom — just Google it. How to register to vote? Google will help you fulfill your patriotic duty. Some of us might be a little ashamed of our search histories at times but at least Google is always there for us. Estately, a real estate website, wants to better understand what people across the nation are searching for so they tapped into the power of Google to discover which how-to searches were most popular in each state over the past five years. (Note: This list doesn't tell us what Iowans Google the most. Instead, it shows what Iowans Google more frequently than other states.) Here is what Iowans need how-to help on: How to make Jell-O shots? How to screenshot? How to throw a curveball? None of these are too embarrassing. Other states certainly had us beat on that, like Kansas, which searches "How to find Kansas?" more than any other state. "How to tip cows" was not a favorite search of Iowans. (Looking at you, New Hampshire.) And we plan to stay far away from Connecticut, whose residents want to know "How to get away with murder?" How to make Jell-O shots? Maybe that just shows we like to have fun. How to screenshot? Look me in the eye and tell me you haven't had to search for that before. And with all of this playoff baseball hoopla, I'd like to know how to throw a curveball like Jake Arrieta, too. Take that, Estately. We're proud of our how-to Google searches. What say you, Kansans? 56 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2eOxz81 TOP VIDEOS Watch: Anti-Trump marchers say they protest to support victims of hate 0:40 Centennial downs Valley at state 0:51 Iowa Election Day #instastory 4:40 Rural Iowa voters boosted Trump, Republicans in election 4:49 East High students stage walkout of Trump win 1:02 Iowan born before woman could vote hopes for history 1:07 How Clinton used Iowa as a stepping stone for campaign 0:38 How Trump wooed Iowa votes with nontraditional campaign stops 0:43 Justin Martin’s funeral procession travels through Rockwell City 0:23 Final Call for Des Moines police Sgt.

Updated: 10/21/16 12:20 am EDT. NEW YORK (CNBC) - Reviews of Alphabet's first "Made by Google" mobile phone are out, and the new handset appears to go toe-to-toe with other premium phones, though it may not outpace them. "Google's ambitious new smartphone, the Pixel, doesn't offer a lot that's new. Yet it's still one of the best out there," The Associated Press' Anick Jesdanun concludes. Google's new Pixel phone has a sleek design that struck reviewers as familiar, if uninspired. While the pricey phone, starting at $649.99, faces some criticism of its photo quality, battery life and speed, other reviewers were blown away by its artificial intelligence, camera and software. With a sleek design, sharper display, good camera, and smarter voice-activated assistant, Pixel provides a compelling sell to iPhone 7 users,The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern writes. The battery life falls a bit short on the regular-sized model, but it charges faster than an iPhone, she says. She says the biggest challenge is the software. While the apps work more fluidly than Apple's iOS or other Android versions, and the updates are automatic, Stern notes that her friends and family are already entrenched in Apple's iMessage. Plus, Google's Assistant logs queries, she writes. "The Assistant works great but you have to be willing to let Google be Big Brother," Stern wrote. Brian X. Chen takes a more downbeat view in The New York Times, calling the phone "mediocre" and "underwhelming." "It is slower than Apple's iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung's smaller flagship phone. Photos shot with Pixel's camera don't look as good as the iPhone's. And Google's built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb. But hey, the Pixel probably won't burn down your garage or injure a child." Chen ran into some glitches with Google Assistant when trying to use natural language requests, and noted that the camera seemed to "exaggerate cyans and magentas," making images appear colder. Unlike Stern, Chen wasn't taken with the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone. Still, for Android loyalists, Chen recommends Project Fi, Google's experimental wireless service, which he found to be reliable and a "good, frugal option." Personal tech guru Walt Mossberg writes that the Pixel is the first-rate Android phone that, at long last, will shake up the industry. "Suddenly, there's no longer an Apple-Samsung duopoly in premium handsets," he wrote. The design is familiar, pleasant but conservative, Mossberg notes, and the Android platform is easy to use. "The Pixel is easily the best Android phone I've ever tested, and seems to hail from a different planet than the chunky, clumsy and pokey 2008 G1 which introduced Android to the world," Mossberg wrote in The Verge and Recode. The phone comes with a few minor inconveniences, he says: It doesn't ship with earbuds, and when asked for the ingredients of apple pie, Google's Assistant fails to list "apples." But it still outflanks Siri, according to Mossberg. The battery life fell short of 10 hours during Mossberg's test, below the 13 hours promised, and the camera was a bit weaker than the iPhone 7 in dim light, he says. Plus, Google's 24-hour chat support just isn't the same as going to an Apple store. USA Today's Ed Baig called the Pixel a "winner," noting two positives right off the bat: the presence of a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and the lack of a bump to accommodate the camera. The access to unlimited cloud storage boosts the usefulness of the Pixel's high-end camera, according to Baig, and he, too, notes how smart Google Assistant is when responding to more complicated queries. "I asked the Assistant to 'tell me about my day' and it reported my local weather, told me what appointments I had coming and how long my commute would take. Without prompting, it then played radio broadcasts from NPR, Fox, News, Bloomberg, and BBC. When I asked it to show me pictures of Sydney with horses, it correctly surmised that I meant my daughter Sydney rather than Sydney, Australia, and found pictures I'd taken of of her with horses in my Google Photos stash. When I instead asked the Assistant to 'show me pictures of Sydney with bridges' it pulled pictures of the Sydney Harbour Bridge off the web. Google Assistant was also able to translate 'how do I find a bathroom in French?' into that language. Given the same query, Siri pointed me to the web. To be fair, on some complicated requests, the Assistant also directed me to the web. Google Assistant was able to identify songs where I only knew a few of the lyrics and played them, sometimes, through YouTube. Still, Baig notes, the phone has only a single speaker and lacks the same level of water-resistance as competitors. Filed under:  Google > next

 Google Flights just got an update that can help you save money on your next trip Benjamin Zhang Oct. 18, 2016, 4:58 PM 7,831 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google Flights on mobile. Google This week, Google released the latest update to its Google Flights online travel booking service. Even though the service has been around for a few years, it can now provide more specific buying advice like when to book a flight to get the best deal. "Google Flights can now help you be more confident that you’re booking your flight at the right time to get the best price," the tech giant said in a blog post announcing the new features titled "Making travel planning less stressful this holiday season" "We now show you when prices are expected to increase for some specific flights and routes you’re interested in." In terms of basic functionality, Google Flights behaves very much the same as every other online booking service. You choose your  travel dates, destination, number of tickets, and the fare class you want to fly in. But what sets Google's product apart from the others is its ability to offer concise pricing advice. For instance, Google Flights is now capable of telling you the amount you can save by making slight modifications to your travel plan, such as switching to an alternate airport or changing the date of departure. Google In addition, Google Flights can notify you when prices are expected to increase and by how much. However, it should be noted that the the information is based on historic data and isn't 100% accurate all the time.

No such stigma attaches to tech, for now. Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, appears on giant screens on Oct. 10, 2016, during an event to launch the social media company's Workplace enterprise application. Amid record cross-pollination between Silicon Valley and Washington, there have been persistent rumours linking Sandberg with the post of Treasury secretary in a Hillary Clinton administration. Sandberg has said she plans to stay at Facebook.  (JUSTIN TALLIS / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By Saleha MohsinBloomberg Tues., Oct. 18, 2016 WASHINGTON, D.C.—A political weather map of America would show Wall Street under a cloud, and Silicon Valley bathed in sunshine. Over the Obama administration’s eight years, the technology industry has embedded itself in Washington. The president hung out with Facebook Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg and hired the government’s first chief tech officer. At least at the lower levels of officialdom, the revolving door with companies such as Google is spinning ever faster — as it once did with Wall Street.` Politicians have played down their connections to finance since the taxpayer bailout of 2008. No such stigma attaches to tech, for now. But as the Valley steps up its lobbying efforts, with a wish-list that ranges from immigration to rules for driverless cars, some critics warn that similar traps lie in wait: it’s not easy for the government to police an industry from which it poaches talent and solicits help with writing laws. “If you’re trying to influence government policy on behalf of a corporate sector, it’s not better that you do it for the tech industry than for Goldman,” said Jeff Hauser from the Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington. Hauser heads the Revolving Door Project, which scrutinizes political appointees. Even amid mounting concern over inequality, he says wealthy tech executives and their companies are still considered cool. In other words: it may be hard to persuade people these days that what’s good for Goldman Sachs is good for America — but it might just work for Google. Article Continued Below The five biggest U.S. tech companies are now the five biggest companies, period — at least as measured by market value. And they’re flexing that financial muscle. The tech firms spent $49 million (U.S.) on Washington lobbyists last year, while the five largest banks shelled out $19.7 million, data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics shows. On the personnel front, the Campaign for Accountability, a non-profit group, studied the to-and-fro between government and Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc. It found that 183 people who worked under President Barack Obama through last year were hired by Google, while 58 headed the other way. Google is in Washington to “help policy-makers understand our business and the work we do to keep the Internet open and fuel economic growth,” the Mountain View, Calif.-based company said by e-mail in response to questions. Facebook’s goals in the capital include protecting customers, “explaining how our service works, and maintaining an open Internet and a culture of innovation,” it said in an e-mail. There have been other high-profile moves out of Washington: former Attorney General Eric Holder this year took a job at Airbnb Inc., and David Plouffe, Obama’s one-time campaign manager, started at Uber Technologies Inc. in 2014. Persistent rumours have linked Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg with the post of Treasury secretary in a Hillary Clinton administration. Sandberg, a former chief of staff at the Treasury under Larry Summers, told a conference this month that she plans to stay at Facebook. Apple Inc.’s chief executive officer Tim Cook and Microsoft Corp.’s founder Bill Gates were on a list of Clinton’s potential vice-presidential nominees, according to an e-mail allegedly from her campaign chair that was released by WikiLeaks. The administration’s view is that tech people are welcome in Washington because they can help make things work better — and help is certainly needed. Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary, says the government is shifting toward using technology the way business has been doing for years. It has set up a coding boot-camp for employees, while data scientists work across federal agencies to mine the archives and help improve transportation projects. “We view data as currency,” Pritzker said in an interview. She travels to Silicon Valley at least once a quarter and has an advisory council of 21 tech experts. Megan Smith, the former Google manager who took a job as Obama’s chief technology officer in 2014, says the long-term goal is to make government services as smooth a user experience as that offered by, say, Amazon or Dropbox. Collaboration with tech companies predates Obama’s creation of a special post to oversee it. Zillow Group Inc., the real-estate website, helped the Treasury after the housing-market collapse, according to Stan Humphries, its chief analytics officer. “I was struck by how little data the government had” in areas such as price indexes or foreclosures, Humphries said. The Seattle-based firm filled the gap, offering its micro-data to Federal Reserve researchers and even, on occasion, to Neel Kashkari, then an assistant secretary at the Treasury department and now in charge of the Minneapolis Fed. “They were soon sucking up every bit of data that we had available,” said Humphries. In Washington, favours typically come at a price though. Tech giants, which are in the habit of buying up smaller companies and also trying to tie customers to their own platforms, keep a close watch on antitrust policy. In 2013, Google — like Microsoft before it — was threatened with a potentially costly legal battle. Federal Trade Commission staff said the company “unlawfully maintained its monopoly” over Internet searches, though the 20-month probe was eventually closed. “Competition policy, that’s the thing they’re most scared of,” said Barry Lynn, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, a Washington think-tank. “If a Microsoft-style case was brought against any of these companies, it could totally change their business prospects. It could result in radical changes to the scale and structure of their corporations.” Cases have been opened in Europe against Google and Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, said Lynn. He’s a Republican, showing that concern about the growing power of the tech giants isn’t confined to the political left. Not that the left doesn’t share it. Clinton has talked about tougher antitrust laws aimed at ending the “abuse of economic power” by corporations. She’s also taken aim at their shifting of profits overseas to avoid taxes. Hauser, who worked at the Justice Department’s antitrust division before joining the Revolving Door Project, said tech firms “are at the leading edge of tax avoidance because of the ways they’ve perfected moving their intellectual property overseas.” He said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew’s support for Apple, after the iPhone-maker was ordered to pay back-taxes in Europe, is an unprecedented stance for a Democratic administration. Clinton’s Republican rival Donald Trump proposed a tax cut for companies that repatriate profits, though it didn’t win him many converts in the tech industry. Then there’s the labour market. Trump has taken aim at Apple among other companies that have shifted jobs overseas. “We’re going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country,” he said in January. But the iPhone-maker announced this month it’s setting up a second R&D centre in China. Big tech simply doesn’t hire on the same scale as its heavy-industry predecessors. And technology is reshaping the workforce in other ways too, with Silicon Valley favourites such as Uber and Taskrabbit Inc. at the forefront. They’re central to the growth of a gig economy that’s spurred calls for rules on health-care and employment insurance to be updated. Tech companies also typically back immigration rights for skilled labour that have become politically toxic, and they support trade accords that both presidential candidates oppose. They’ve clashed with the government over the balance between internet privacy and national security, notably when Apple boss Cook refused to help unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. Beyond the shopping-list of specifics, says Lynn, the industry has one overarching desire: light-touch regulation. “They want to be left alone,” he said. “They want to be allowed to do what they want to do.” And to keep Washington at arm’s length, it helps to get close to it first.

(Photo: Handout/Google) Google’s ambitious new smartphone, the Pixel, doesn’t offer a lot that’s new. Yet it’s still one of the best out there. Google achieves that by pulling together the best features from Apple, Samsung and other phone makers and offering them at prices comparable to iPhones — starting at about $650 for the regular, 5-inch model and $770 for the 5.5-inch “XL” edition. Both versions go on sale Thursday through Verizon, Best Buy and Google’s online store. I tested the Pixel XL model; the regular version has identical features except for its smaller display and battery — still enough for 13 hours of internet use, according to Google. With either, you get an excellent camera and a strong voice assistant that promises to get smarter — all without the bloat common with other Android phones. The Pixel isn’t quite an iPhone replacement, as Google wants you to believe; hardware is just part of what makes an iPhone an iPhone. But it might serve up a strong challenge to Samsung, especially as people look for alternatives to the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. The camera: The Pixel’s image quality is superb — though purists may quibble. Colors in some shots look too strong and clean to me, thanks to software processing intended to reduce distortion and improve detail (something all phones do to some extent). But automation pays off in another way: The Pixel will automatically combine successive shots into an animated “GIF” file, offering a fun way to share a toddler’s steps or a dog jumping. For video, the Pixel’s stabilization technology compensates for shaky hands and other movement, matching what the iPhone and Galaxy phones can do. The Pixel borrows a quick-launch feature from Samsung phones. Just double tap the power button to start the camera, even if the phone is locked. To switch between the front and rear cameras, just double twist the phone like a door knob — a feature Motorola, which Google once owned, has long offered. Low-light images taken with the Pixel in three museums aren’t as crisp as those from the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 (which has the same camera as the Note 7). But differences are small, and the Pixel does better than typical smartphones. Where the Pixel falls short is in extreme close-ups, such as shooting a flower petal or a small bug; photos were typically blurry. The Pixel’s selfie camera is also inferior, with no front flash or control over the focus. But it’s fine in good light and at typical distances for selfies. The assistant: Google’s voice assistant, simply known as Google Assistant, will seem familiar to those who have used Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa features. Google’s version goes further in offering daily updates such as weather and news, though plenty of apps already offer similar capabilities through notifications. Google is also better at remembering preferences — say, if you prefer temperatures in Celsius — and at integrating with its own services, such as Translate and Photos. But Assistant doesn’t yet sync with a similar Assistant in Google’s Allo chat app and upcoming Home speaker. And it isn’t as proactive as the Google Now assistant already built into Android phones. Google Now, for instance, will look through your Gmail account for flight reservations and remind you when to head to the airport. It will analyze your daily commute and warn of delays. Assistant waits for you to ask. Assistant holds up well compared with Siri and Alexa, but for more, swipe from left to right to get the old Google Now back. Google says Assistant will eventually get the Google Now functionality. Other features: If you need help, you can reach Google’s customer support and enable screen-sharing reminiscent of Amazon’s Mayday help feature. And the Pixel will work with Google’s upcoming Daydream View virtual-reality headset, much as Samsung phones have Samsung’s Gear VR. Long-pressing an app icon brings up a menu of shortcuts, such as getting directions to home or launching the selfie camera. It’s similar to the iPhone’s 3D Touch. The Pixel also offers “Night Light,” a feature that tints your screen amber by filtering out blue light that might keep you up at night. Apple calls it Night Shift. Pixel owners get unlimited storage of photos at original resolution, though that’s a little like offering Google search for free. Google Photos already offers unlimited storage at up to 16 megapixels; the Pixel’s camera is 12 megapixels. The free offer will make a difference for those who take video in ultra-sharp “4k” resolution, but the default setting is lower, at 1080p, which is already free at Google Photos. What’s missing: The Pixel will be OK if you spray it with water, but don’t drop it in the pool. You also can’t expand its storage with a memory card, as you can with the S7 and Note 7 — though for $100 more, the Pixel’s 32 gigabytes of storage quadruples to 128 gigabytes, and the free online storage should take care of your photos and videos. The battery isn’t removable, though that’s true for most phones these days. 12 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

CNET Industry website CNET gives the Pixel a score of 8.8, the same as the iPhone 7 Plus. The phone's camera is "mostly awesome," said Lynn La, with a wide enough front-facing lens to take flattering selfies. Still, the camera wasn't as sharp in dim lighting, the artsy "blur" effect is patchy, and the video stabilization gave shots a "surreal, almost drone-like quality," plus, you're limited to Verizon among the four major U.S. carriers, she said. "But the Pixel is a beaut," La wrote. "It runs fast and comes at a time when the largest Android phone maker, Samsung, is hitting some rough luck." Business Insider Pixel showcases what Google does best: finding information, a la Google Assistant. The hardware itself, however, is "easily the least exciting part" of the phone, BI's Steve Kovach wrote. "Google also has a major advantage over Apple. It has always been better at software and services, and nothing proves that more than Google Assistant, the new digital helper that lives inside the Pixel and future Google-made products like the Google Home speaker. The Pixel phone is a taste of a future in which hardware matters less and the artificial intelligence that powers it takes precedence. And no one is better positioned to take advantage of that future at the moment than Google." While some called the Pixel "bland," its ability to check the best-in-class boxes impressed shareholders: Shares were up more than 2 percent Tuesday.

Mossberg: Google’s first phone is first rate The Verge 18/10/2016 Walt Mossberg © Provided by The Verge At long last, almost 8 years to the day the first Android phone went on sale, Google is launching a smartphone for which it designed the hardware, software and cloud ecosystem itself: the Pixel. No longer will the tech giant be entirely dependent on other companies to present Android in its best light, in hardware that varied wildly but never was built from the ground up to be the best physical instantiation of pure, Google Android. I wrote last year and last week about why it makes sense for Google to become, like Apple, a vertically integrated hardware maker. I believe this is the right move. I believe it will shake up the industry. But the question is: how did Google do? How good is the Pixel? After testing the historic phone since last week, I can say that the Pixel is very, very good. In its first try, Google has landed itself in the same class as Apple’s iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy S7 (that company’s non-exploding model). Like those formidable competitors, it’s comfortable and practical; fast and fluid; takes very good pictures; and is connected to a strong ecosystem. The Pixel is easily the best Android phone I’ve ever tested, and seems to hail from a different planet than the chunky, clumsy and pokey 2008 G1 which introduced Android to the world. My biggest disappointment with the expensive phone is that it’s battery life didn’t measure up to Google’s claims in my tests. It wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t terrific. It also isn’t water resistant, and is exclusive to only a single carrier, Verizon. My biggest pleasant surprise with the Pixel was the built-in Google Assistant, the company’s artificial intelligent assistant, which, while not perfect, was impressive and far better than Apple’s Siri. My overwhelmingly positive results with the Assistant, which is debuting as a built-in feature on the Pixel, matter a lot. That’s because Google is building the Pixel and other hardware precisely so it can showcase and refine its artificial intelligence work. Design The Pixel comes in two models, with identical top-of-the-line specs and excellent cameras: a 5-inch model and a 5.5-inch model, the Pixel XL. These are premium phones, priced in iPhone territory. They start at $649 for a base, 32GB Pixel and top out at $869 for a 128GB XL model. Which makes it surprising that the design is… conservative. And, by conservative, I mean that, from the front, the Pixel pretty much looks like an iPhone, complete with the big top and bottom bezels or chins that I am hoping Apple eliminates next year. Almost everyone I showed it to just shrugged and thought it was an iPhone. Only those who took a minute for closer examination noticed the absence of a bottom physical home button, and the different arrangement of the side buttons. The back of the Pixel is very different from the iPhone’s, because there’s a glass rectangle at the top on which Google has placed a large round fingerprint sensor, instead of where Apple has it, on the front. The PIxel also lacks a camera bump, because it’s slightly thicker at the top. It’s a pleasant, familiar design that feels good in the hand. But it isn’t an attempt to show off any design or hardware chops and it gives Apple a break in a year when the new iPhone has the same body for a third year in a row. Using it I slipped right into using the Pixel with ease, even though my main phone is an iPhone. I still find Android just a bit geekier than iOS, but the gap has narrowed greatly and Google’s special version of Android 7.0 Nougat on the Pixel is fast and fluid. There’s no distracting layer of junkware and hosts of duplicate apps, as on third-party Android phones. On the Pixel, you just slide up to see all your apps, besides the ones you’ve placed on the home screens. You slide down for quick settings. And there’s even a feature sort of like Apple’s 3D Touch on the Pixel: a long press on some icons will bring up quick actions. For instance, press on the camera icon for shortcuts to taking a selfie or a video. I installed and used third-party apps, including Facebook, Twitter, Slack and Apple Music. All worked fine, but several seemed behind, or less slick, than their iOS counterparts. For instance, it’s much easier in Slack for iOS to find your history of direct messages. I tested the Pixel with my car’s Bluetooth, which was smooth as silk. It even worked fine with Apple’s pre-production AirPod earphones, although without any of their special iOS pairing features. I also tested Android Pay on the Pixel at Walgreen’s and Starbucks and it worked fine. Speaking of earbuds, there’s good and bad news. The good: Google retained the industry-standard 3.5 mm headphone jack. The bad: it doesn’t supply any earbuds for a $649 phone. The company says it assumes everyone has many pairs of buds lying around. I wound up using an old Samsung pair. The Assistant The Pixel was built to showcase Google’s new artificial intelligence feature, the Google Assistant. It’s the only phone so far on which you can call up this new feature by just pressing the home button or saying "OK, Google." The Assistant appears in a text or chat format, because it’s meant to carry on a conversation with you. (You can also use it in the new, optional Google messaging app, Allo.) Google warns that the Assistant is just in its earliest days, and still missing a lot of smarts and capabilities. For instance, it can’t read your emails and texts. It can’t book you a flight. And when I asked it for the ingredients for apple pie, it failed to list apples — though a more complete list appeared if I tapped on a web link it presented. Having said that, the Assistant blew away every competitor I’ve tried. It shredded Siri, which has a five-year lead. It not only did on-phone tasks reliably — like launching an app, or creating reminders or notes or playing music — but it understood most of the wider-world questions I asked it. Even more impressively, it remembered the general subject I was asking about, so I didn’t have to repeat the topic with every question. Here’s a series of questions I asked about the state where I live, without ever saying the state’s name except in the first question. The Assistant answered every question but one with a vocal reply, and answered all quickly and accurately: — What’s the population of Maryland? — Who’s the governor? — What’s the average household income? — What’s the land area? — Show me the state flag — What’s the biggest county? I’m pretty sure I could have gone on. When I tried this with Siri, it handled the first one nicely, vocally and with a Wikipedia page. It answered the second by displaying an article defining the term governor. For all of its other qualities, the Pixel is worth considering just for the Assistant. Camera In good light, I found that the camera took very pleasing, vivid photos, with colors that popped — an effect enhanced by the phone’s OLED screen. I liked them, and you may as well. But sometimes, the Pixel’s photos seemed too saturated. For instance, a Pixel photo of flowers in my garden that are a bit past their peak looked unnaturally colorful on the Pixel’s screen, even though I liked the effect. They looked more realistic in an iPhone 7 shot viewed on the iPhone 7 screen. When viewed side by side on a non-OLED laptop screen, they looked nearly identical. Your preference will be a matter of personal taste. The camera on the Pixel also lacks optical image stabilization, unlike on the iPhone. Videos I took walking around my neighborhood weren’t too shaky, though. In dim light, however, I found the iPhone 7 did much better than the Pixel. Some combination of its wider lens aperture and flash gave it the edge, and objects were clearer. Having said all that, the Pixel has a very good camera that should please almost every user in almost every situation. Battery Life It’s tough to measure battery life on a smartphone, because it depends too much on a wide variety of factors, including what features and apps a person used, for how long each, and how far the phone was from good cellular and Wi-Fi connections. However, in my short few days of testing, using the smaller Pixel, I never approached the 13 hours or so Google claimed for most activities. On a day when I was focused on battery life, streaming a 90-minute movie and playing music for hours, I got only a few minutes over 9 hours — not even enough to get most people through a full work day, including commutes. As I write this, having played little music and streamed no video today, the phone is predicting I’ll get 12 hours. For comparison, in my typical usage patterns, and in the same areas and phone network, the iPhone 7 got between 12 and 14 hours. Google couldn’t explain my results, and I must note that a colleague doing his own review had a much better battery life experience with the Pixel. Support Google has no experience supporting consumers who bought hardware. It’s promising online and phone support "day or night". From right on the phone. I didn’t test this, but, even if it’s good, it’s not the same as getting human help at hundreds of Apple stores around the world. Bottom Line If you’re an Android fan, willing to buy a premium phone, the Pixel is your answer. To repeat: it’s simply the best Android phone I’ve tested. If you’re an iPhone user thinking of switching, the Pixel will seem physically familiar, but you’ll have to overcome the sticky links you’ve developed with fellow iPhone users, things like iMessage (which Google can’t match yet) and iCloud Photo Sharing (which Google is trying to copy.) You’ll also have to do without the comfort of your neighborhood Genius Bar. But my main message, dear readers, is this: Google has come out of the gate with a top-flight phone and suddenly, there’s no longer an Apple-Samsung duopoly in premium handsets.

 Everyone loves Google's new phone, and the stock has hit an all-time high Steve Kovach Oct. 18, 2016, 4:04 PM 14,381 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the company's Pixel phone announcement. AP It's shaping up to be a good week for Google's parent company, Alphabet. Following a bunch of glowing reviews for Google's first smartphone, the Pixel, Alphabet's stock reached all-time highs Tuesday, reaching up to $801 per share. The Pixel, which is available this week, is just the first device of a slew of new hardware products from Google. In a few weeks, it'll release the Google Home connected speaker, a new router called Google Wifi, and a new version of the Chromecast that works with 4K TVs. It's still too early to judge whether Google's new emphasis on hardware can match the scale of companies like Apple and Samsung. It'll be years before that happens. But the company is off to a good start. Before Google announced the hardware, some analysts predicted the stock would go all the way to $1,000. Alphabet reports earnings on October 27.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama October 18 Follow @htsuka Twitter has initiated talks with several technology companies, including Alphabet's Google and Salesforce.com, to explore a sale, according to CNBC, Fred Katayama reports. (Reuters) I, like, many Twitter users, watched with interest as the social network's shares fell off a cliff last week when Salesforce — believed to be Twitter’s most enthusiastic suitor in its latest round of bids —  said the social site was “not the right fit” for the firm. It was an anticlimactic end to a breathless news cycle that had reported that Twitter, which is on the market, was entertaining bids from Google, Disney and Salesforce and sent the company’s stock soaring as investors thought they’d see a big payday from a sale. But the fizzle at the end raised a big question in my mind: Why doesn’t anyone want to buy Twitter? After all, the social network has over 300 million active users, has been a key platform in the 2016 election and is the go-to online megaphone for essentially anyone who has to say anything online. [Facebook, Twitter and Instagram sent feeds that helped police track minorities in Ferguson and Baltimore, report says] The somewhat boring financial answer is that Twitter simply doesn't make enough money off of its devoted users. Nor does it know how to keep growing its network to offset that fact. The past several Twitter earnings reports have shown that revenue growth and user growth have been lower than expected when the company first went public. So while Twitter can claim that it is unique, companies may be right to question how much investment it will take to turn that uniqueness into actual value. As a user, though, I believe there's a more obvious reason why Twitter isn't a great candidate for acquisition: Without its independence, it just wouldn't be Twitter. That attitude can be hobbling for the company. Arguably Twitter's biggest issue has been its ongoing struggle with harassment, abuse and just general bad behavior on its network. But Twitter's own devoted users make it difficult for the company to resolve that issue easily. [‘I always get back up’: Leslie Jones returns to social media after nasty hack] There tend to be two camps of thought on this issue: There are those who say Twitter needs to police its content more thoroughly to keep damaging posts off the network. And there are those who say any attempts at cleaning up the network is tantamount to censorship — a problem for a company that still touts its role in the Arab Spring and other revolutions. For Twitter, moving too far in either direction means alienating a lot of users. The fact that Twitter's users even get to debate over the soul of the network underscores the platform's devotion to free expression -- and makes one wonder about how that value would jell with another company. Disney, for example, was named as a potential buyer. It would have been interesting to see how a company that encourages debate as much as Twitter does would have worked with a company that doesn’t even let its workers have unkempt facial hair. (Bloomberg reported that Twitter's image was indeed a factor in Disney's decision to back off its bid.) [‘Not strong enough anymore’: Chrissy Teigen goes private on Twitter, devastating fans] Who's a good fit for Twitter, then? Who else would users accept as overseers of their Twitter accounts? Maybe not strait-laced Salesforce, which prides professionalism over rants. Maybe not even Google, which, while perhaps a better cultural fit, would almost certainly try to leverage Twitter's data and maybe alienate users. (The same could be true of any company looking to make money off Twitter's data.) So while the image issues alone may not be what keeps Twitter from finding a buyer, adding in the weak financials make it a harder pill to swallow. There is a bright spot here for the social network, however. With this super hyped bidding round under its belt, Twitter management has shown shareholders clamoring for an acquisition that it has seriously considered a sale. Still, that puts even greater pressure on chief executive Jack Dorsey — whose 2015 return to the company he founded drew comparisons to Steve Jobs’s return to Apple — to take Twitter into its successful next stage. To date, Dorsey hasn’t managed to turn his genius for product into something that can assure investors there's a strong future ahead. [‘Skittles’ photo gets taken down from Donald Trump Jr.’s tweet] It doesn’t help Twitter that its chief social networking rival, Facebook, seems to be moving from strength to more strength. While Twitter investors are always asking for more information on where the firm is going each quarter, Facebook’s investors have been given a 10-year plan. Yet it's not quite fair to compare the two: Facebook’s business model centers on keeping people on its site for as long as possible so they’ll see and engage with ads there. Twitter is all about quickly getting as much information from as many places as possible and letting the stream flow into users' feeds. That’s great for knowledge but not so good for engagement. To fix that issue, Twitter has a pretty clear road map. But it requires the firm to play in some uncertain areas. Twitter's experiment with live events has been fascinating to watch. New tools such as Periscope have expanded to try to dominate the market for live video — which Facebook is also eyeing — and last week Twitter said that users would be able to live stream from streaming software or cameras, as well as smartphones. Twitter has also used its live feature to host centralized live events augmented with commentary. The social network struck a deal with the NFL for Thursday Night Football, hoping to bring more eyeballs to the network  -- and its ads -- during games. It’s hard to judge how well the experiment is doing in a year when NFL ratings overall are down, but the feature itself has been generally well-received by thosewho have tried it. Users can see the live the game while surfing the stream — seeing comments from other viewers as well as ads in the feed. Now that Twitter has thrown a bone to those clamoring for a sale, it may be able to focus more closely on its central problem: turning enthusiasm for live events and for its general product into consistent growth and profit. But it will have to act quickly. The hype after Dorsey’s return raised the stakes that much higher, and failing to effect a turnaround can have drastic consequences.

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Google Assistant Has a Fun Game Show Easter Egg for When You're Feeling Lucky Dallas Thomas 2 weeks ago Google Assistant Has a Fun Game Show Easter Egg for When You're Feeling Lucky If you took your favorite search engine, gave it a witty personality, and bundled it together with a messenger-style interface, you'd have the new Google Assistant. It's great for getting fast answers—even on your follow-up questions—but its flair for fun might just be the standout feature. Don't Miss: How to Get the Pixel's Google Assistant Working on Other Android Devices According Ars Technica, Google worked with experts from Pixar and The Onion to "craft a personality" for the Assistant. They've also discovered a silly, time-wasting game baked into the app. It's an Easter Egg of sorts, so you have to access it by saying "I'm Feeling Lucky," but then, a miniature game show starts up, complete with corny music and a live studio audience (check out Ars' video to see what we mean). From there, you'll be asked how many contestants are playing, so the game show Easter Egg even works with multiple players. But once the actual game starts, you'll be asked a series of trivia questions. There's no timers or buzzers, but Google Assistant will start listening as soon as it finishes the question, so just fire off with your answers. Each round of the I'm Feeling Lucky game consists of five questions, and the Google Assistant will even give you a random nickname (ours was Salamander) to make things feel more personal. But once you've answered all of the questions, you'll hear some applause (or maybe a few jeers), then the Assistant will summarize your score and ask if you'd like to play another round.

Comments By Jon Phillips Follow PCWorld | Oct 18, 2016 6:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Android Smartphones Consumer Technology Comments The Pixel XL is the first Android phone to deliver an emphatic, cohesive, surprise-and-delight experience. Samsung and the other Android phone makers have tried to give users something magical before, but they never quite made fetch happen. Even Google itself has toyed with a unified software/hardware gestalt via its Nexus phones, but those devices could sometimes feel like stripped-down vessels for disconnected software services.  But in the Pixel XL we finally have an Android phone that directly competes with the iPhone in terms of holistic design. For this we can thank Google Assistant, which serves as a central entry point for all the Google services I’ve been using daily since I switched from the iPhone in 2014.  [Related: Google makes more than Samsung, Apple on flagship phone ] Indeed, there’s no underestimating the value of having Assistant baked directly into the home button. It really ties the room together. And after using the Pixel XL for four days, I feel the phone is markedly more special than my Nexus 6P daily driver. Adam Patrick Murray Just a button-press away, Google Assistant ties together Google’s new mobile experience. The Pixel XL is expensive at $769, and unless you’re willing to buy it unlocked from Google, it’s currently only available from one carrier (Verizon). But let me make my case for the first fully Google-branded Android phone. Below I share why I love the Pixel XL, and why you have to consider it a leading candidate for your next phone upgrade. Pixel-exclusive interface improvements User interface design matters. A good smartphone interface sets the tone for the entire user experience, and in the 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL, Google delivers the best Android calling card yet.  Adam Patrick Murray The new Pixel launcher—exclusive to the Pixel phones—replaces the full-width search box with a small Google button, and ditches the App Tray for a swipe gesture. The Pixel XL argument starts with a new home screen, which is currently exclusive to Google-branded Pixel phones, and apparently won’t be included in Android 7.1, the update that’s slated to arrive on Nexus phones in December (at the earliest). The Pixel home screen replaces Google’s full-width search box with a more demure button; ditches the App Tray button for a much more graceful swipe-to-view-apps gesture; and rescues Google Assistant from exile in the Allo app by fusing it to the Home button, where people will actually use and enjoy it. The Pixel phones are also the first devices to surface Android 7.1’s app shortcuts: Just long-press on an app icon, and you’ll get options to launch directly into specific behaviors. The Messenger shortcut is especially useful because it points to your most recent text conversations. Long-press on an app icon, and you may find shortcut options for specific behaviors. Most Google apps already support shortcuts, and an API opens up shortcuts to third-party devs. iPhone users won’t be impressed, but if you’re an Android enthusiast, and want app shortcuts now, you’ll need to buy a Pixel phone, as it’s the launch device for Android 7.1.  The Pixel phones also come with an expanded live wallpaper gallery, and many of the new options are simply awesome. One live wallpaper pulls an image from Google Earth, showing what your specific location looks like from space, complete with current cloud cover. Another live wallpaper shows a serene series of color gradients that change according to the time and weather conditions. The Pixel’s data-driven live wallpapers add an extra surprise-and-delight element that marries tasteful design with Google’s unique data talents. There are a few more live wallpapers, and each marries art and design with big data in a uniquely Googley way. It’s trademark surprise-and-delight, and just like perfectly designed cupholders, they don’t improve performance, but they sure make driving the Pixel XL more enjoyable and increase pride-of-ownership. Google Assistant is the place for everything Google Assistant is currently available to all smartphones—Android and iPhone alike—via the Allo messaging app. But if you want the feature built directly into your phone’s home button, you’ll need to buy a Pixel or Pixel XL. Google Assistant feels a lot like Google Now, and it actually pops up when you voice “OK Google” into your phone. But in stepping beyond Google Now, Assistant adds some features that dive directly into your own personal knowledge graph. Adam Patrick Murray Ultra-specific searches of Google Photos are but an Assistant query away. For example: If you voice, “Show me photos of cars from July,” Assistant will pull images of cars from your own Google Photo album. You can also tell Assistant to remember personal data. For example, if you voice, “Remember my fake password is 1 2 3 4,” Assistant will recall that data when you later ask, “What’s my fake password?” Perhaps the biggest surprise-and-delight feature is Assistant’s daily briefing. When you voice, “What’s my day looking like?”, Assistant can reply with a localized weather report; details on your work commute; specifics about your next meeting; and details on any reminders you’ve set. You can deselect any of the elements above, and also define whether your daily briefing ends with an audio news report. I counted 48 podcast news sources on Google’s current feed. Adam Patrick Murray Google Assistant’s Daily Briefing can share data on weather, commute, calendar appointments and reminders, and can even end with an audio newscast. Google Assistant is also useful for hooking into Google services, and to this extent you may find yourself tapping many fewer app icons if you buy the Pixel. Voice “Navigate to the Grand Canyon,” and Assistant will push you directly into driving directions via Google Maps. Voice “Play Asteroids Galaxy Tour on YouTube,” and one of the artist’s videos will open accordingly. You can also get ultra-specific and leave the Google universe. For example, when you voice, “Play So What by Miles Davis on Spotify,” Assistant will deliver that song on the third-party app. Allo’s Google Assistant is even smarter Oddly, the version of Assistant baked into Allo is currently more advanced than the version built into the Pixel’s home button. The version of Assistant in Allo supports emoji games and email searches. For example, the Allo Assistant can dig into your Gmail, and search for emails that contain specific terms. Email search isn’t yet available in the Pixel’s Assistant, but my Google contact tells me this feature should arrive in the coming months.  Similarly, you can play emoji games in Allo’s Assistant, but not in Pixel’s Assistant because, as my Google contact shares, “Emoji games are a family of games that sometimes require emoji input, which is not currently available with [Pixel’s] voice input.” Every Pixel comes with Allo pre-installed, but I still eagerly await the day when Pixel’s Assistant gets full text-entry support. I’d also love the ability to execute super-granular app requests. For example, the camera app magically launches into its video interface when you voice, “Take a video.” But when you say, “Take a slow motion video,” you’re just dumped into web search results. Am I asking for too much? Perhaps. But just the fact that I think Google Assistant might be able to drop me into slo-mo speaks to the power of the service. Now this is a fast camera We cover the Pixel XL’s image quality—for both still photos and video—in our official review. So check out that article if you’re interested in the performance of Google’s 1.55-micron sensor pixels and video stabilization algorithms. For this report, I can only speak to the camera’s user experience, and I find it much better than the Nexus 6P’s. Adam Patrick Murray The Pixel camera app doesn’t expose DSLR-style manual controls, but there is a slider for exposure compensation, among a few other fine-tuning features. The camera app loads much more quickly, and from shutter snap to image save, everything about the Pixel XL’s software feels supercharged. Google still hasn’t added legit DSLR-style manual controls for focus, white balance, ISO and shutter speed, but there is a control for “exposure compensation,” which comes in handy for tricky lighting situations, and may be more meaningful to novices than DSLR controls. The two Pixel phones also carry over Smartburst and Lens Blur from the current Nexus phones. Smartburst lets you fire off a machine-gun flurry of shots by pressing and holding the shutter button. The software will then identify the highest-quality image from your salvo, and give you a quick command for keeping that best image and deleting the rest. Lens Blur, meanwhile, delivers a nifty depth-of-field bokeh effect. It doesn’t seem as intelligent as the iPhone 7 Plus’ Portrait mode, but it’s another surprise-and-delight feature that reinforces the greater Pixel experience. Adam Patrick Murray After you’ve shot a bunch of photos with Smartburst, you can grab only the best image, as indentified by the white dot. Tech support? GIFs? Hello, mass market If the camera app teaches us anything, it’s that Google wants to deliver an Android phone for the masses—a phone that’s just as easy to use as the iPhone. But Google goes beyond the camera experience to deliver on that promise. For starters, Pixel owners in the U.S., Canada, and Australia will have access to 24/7 phone support. And if you really run into trouble, the support technician can even take over your screen. There’s also chat support (my preferred option) between 6 am and 9 pm Pacific time. I used this feature three times during my four days of testing, and my longest wait time was about 7 minutes. Google’s techs were helpful and to-the-point, and when one of my questions couldn’t be resolved immediately, the tech followed up with a response to my Gmail. Adam Patrick Murray Don’t scoff. You know you’ll be using the GIF keyboard. I also have to call out the new animated GIF selector in Google’s updated keyboard—because there’s nothing more mainstream-friendly than a shortcut for texting out a GIFstorm. Some third-party keyboards already support animated GIFs, but by including GIFs in its stock keyboard, Google makes a statement about the Pixel’s target audience: It’s not just going after Android nerds. It wants the mass market. A true flagship competitor for the ‘undecided’ few Unfortunately, Google doesn’t do itself any favors by pricing the 5-inch Pixel at $649 and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL at $769. These prices are out of step with previous Nexus phones, and that runs the risk of alienating Google’s core Android fan base. What’s more, $649 and $769 represent the price ceiling for all premium phones. For example, an iPhone 7 Plus with the same amount of storage (32GB) also costs $769. Google mitigates the pain by offering free, uncompressed cloud storage for images and video shot by the Pixel, so perhaps customers won’t feel it necessary to upgrade to the 128GB Pixel XL, which costs a whopping $869. But the bottom line is that Google isn’t positioning the Pixel phones as loss leaders to sweep up new Android-curious consumers. Adam Patrick Murray Nonetheless, the Pixel XL makes a very compelling argument for itself. Everything about the interface feels much less busy than competing Android skins (especially Samsung’s). The phone is easy to use, but does a lot. And the Pixel XL really does feel almost iPhone-like in its marriage of hardware to software. It’s free of carrier and OEM bloatware, and Google’s own rockstar service (Assistant) is pushed to the fore. The Pixel XL is deliberate. It’s calculated. It’s curated. It may not offer IP68 water and dust resistance, wireless charging or optical image stabilization, but the Pixel experience feels extremely well-integrated, and its surprise-and-delight features are wonderful. This alone could sway consumers who wander into a Verizon store with no diehard allegiances to Samsung or Apple, and ask to see the latest hot handsets.  I’d hazard to guess there are more “undecided” smartphone users than undecided presidential voters, and the Pixel XL has to be considered for their third-party votes.

Question is, when the halo wears off, are you going to be left with a smartphone headache for the next two years? We’ve already comprehensively reviewed the Pixel XL, but here’s the low-down on why you should – and why you shouldn’t – buy Google’s new Android flagships. Why should I buy a Google Pixel? 1. The camera is top-notch Camera performance on Nexus devices has always been controversial. Yes, they’ve often been good, but they’ve seldom been great, especially in the face of what both the iPhone and other Android devices can manage. Happily, that’s all changed with this generation. NOW READ: Google Pixel vs Galaxy S7 Camera shoot-out The Pixel and Pixel XL may sport a fairly minor upgrade on the core camera module versus the Nexus 6P, but a combination of that, plus better software and processing, makes a huge difference. More accurate colors, more natural contrast, and a lighter touch on post-tweaking all help make the Pixel directly competitive with what the iPhone 7 can capture. Best of all, the Pixel’s camera is super-fast. 2. This is Nougat at its smoothest and most delicious Android enthusiasts know all too well that their much-anticipated OS updates can sometimes take longer than expected to arrive, but there’s another dirty little secret that many Android phones suffer. Often, out of the box, the Android experience is already subpar. Juddering animations, glitchy scrolling, and laggy apps can sometimes make you wonder whether you really have just bought a brand new device. The Pixel and Pixel XL most certainly don’t suffer such problems. Yes, that’s partly down to the cutting-edge hardware inside, like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 processor and a healthy 4GB of memory, but – as we’ve seen time and time again – smooth performance takes more than just access to the latest parts bin. No, credit needs to go to Google’s optimizations. Software fettling might not be as glamorous as a new chipset (if, indeed, a new chipset could be considered glamorous itself), but the result is an Android phone that really flies. Touch response lag is gone, apps load and scroll with alacrity, and the whole thing feels as responsive as you’d expect for a modern flagship. Other Android phones feel sluggish in comparison. 3. Pixel XL battery life is excellent It’s easy to ignore power management in favor of more exciting features like the camera and screen, but at the end of the day, if your battery is dead, all those shiny parts aren’t much use. Google has clearly taken that to heart, and the Pixel XL puts in an impressive two days on a charge. That’s not with coddling or selectively turning on a low-power, frugal mode, either. And the reasons against? The Pixel and Pixel XL might be Google’s most compelling smartphone’s to-date, but neither is perfect. Sometimes jumping in with both feet makes sense, but there are times when it doesn’t pay to be an early adopter. That goes doubly when you’re dealing with smartphones in the $600+ price bracket. That said, here are three reasons you might want to keep your credit card in your wallet or purse, and hold off on the Google Pixel… 1. Google Assistant still offers beta-level service If your primary reason for buying the Pixel or Pixel XL is Google Assistant, it’s probably worth reconsidering – at least right now. Google’s latest way to turn its knowledge graph (or, in other words, the vast quantity of data about yourself, your schedule, your email, and your location, that you so willingly share with it) into a contextually-aware service definitely shows promise. All the same, it’s worth being realistic about what it can do today. That means helping you find the nearest coffee shop, telling you when your next appointment is, setting alarms and notifications by voice, and entertaining you with whimsical cat videos, among other things. At the same time, you’ll inevitably run into its shortcomings, most often not understanding the context of your follow-up questions. Is it better than Siri? Certainly, yes, but Google Assistant still isn’t something you can rely on to answer all your questions day in, day out. That’ll take time. 2. The design is fairly uninspiring Nobody is going to raise the Pixel up as a striking example of 2016’s finest design. The HTC-made pair of phones are well-made and sturdy, certainly, but they’re hardly handsome. Best scenario is to take pleasure in the detailing – the chamfering around the edge is neatly done – because the glass rear panel and oversized bezels lack charm. Maybe you’ll buy the Pixel and put it straight in a case. Even so, some of Google’s design decisions could still bite you later on. Not least is the absence of waterproofing, which means that – unlike the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 – if you drop your Pixel in the sink, or try to use it in the shower, you can expect it to become an expensive paperweight. 3. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is just around the corner Most of the Samsung chatter right now is how the company is handling the Galaxy Note 7 recall, but fans of the cutting edge know there’s something equally interesting in the pipeline. The Galaxy S7 may now be the company’s flagship Android device, but its replacement is fast approaching. That’s the Galaxy S8, and we’re expecting it early in the new year. In fact, there are whispers that Samsung is doing whatever it can to bring the Galaxy S8 in sooner rather than later. That would certainly help fill the gap the unexpectedly discontinued Note 7 has left, which has all but gifted the holiday season to the iPhone 7. Don’t get too eager for an accelerated launch, mind: early 2017 is still the expected window. The final verdict…? These aren’t the affordable, budget-friendly Nexus phones of old. The Pixel and Pixel XL take on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus directly, price point for price point, and for once you can’t be assured that the spec sheet on the Android side will comfortably out-pace what Apple is offering. Waterproofing, or the lack of it, is a good example of that. Still, if you’re addicted to Google services and want the smoothest way of experiencing them, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the phones for you. No other device – even those running Android – offers the same blend of tight integration with Google’s cloud. Factor in the knowledge that the Pixel will be first in line for any new developments, and it’s a no-brainer.

(Photo: Microsoft) SAN FRANCISCO — As handy as all our voice recognition friends are, conversing with them still feels you're talking to a foreign relative. Whether its Siri (Apple) or Alexa (Amazon) or Google Assistant or Cortana (Microsoft), each requires the human to speak in slow, articulated phrases to increase the odds of comprehension. But researchers at Microsoft say they've reached a milestone that promises a future where machines can transcribe us as well as another person. In a paper published Monday called "Achieving Human Parity in Conversational Speech Recognition," engineers with Microsoft Artificial Intelligence and Research announced they'd developed a speech recognition system that makes the same or fewer errors as professional transcriptionists. The team hit a word error rate of 5.9%, down from the 6.3% WER the team reported just last month. That 5.9% rate is about equal to that of people who were asked to transcribe the same conversation, and according to Microsoft it is the lowest ever recorded. USA TODAY Google Assistant is star of Google's hardware unveil “We’ve reached human parity,” Xuedong Huang, the company’s chief speech scientist, said in a statement. “This is an historic achievement.” Improving voice recognition is bound to have an impact on both consumers and enterprises alike. “This will make Cortana more powerful, making a truly intelligent assistant possible,” said Harry Shum, who heads Microsoft's AI division. Google Home is a new rival to Amazon Echo, both of which use artificial intelligence software to converse with human users.  (Photo: Eric Risberg, AP) Almost every major tech company is pouring resources into machine learning and artificial intelligence, including Apple, Google and Amazon, which has had an unexpected hit with its Alexa-powered Echo. Last month, Amazon announced its new Alexa Prize, which is aimed at college students with an interest in developing AI that is able to converse at length with humans. The winning team will receive $500,000, but Amazon will award students an additional $1 million if they successfully get their AI to speak with humans engagingly for 20 minutes. USA TODAY Meet Home, Google's answer to Amazon Echo “A socialbot that can converse coherently for 20 minutes is unprecedented and at least five times more advanced than state-of-the-art conversational AI,” Rohit Prasad, vice president and head scientist of Amazon Alexa, said in a statement when the prize was announced. Samsung recently bought itself AI expertise with the purchase of Viv, an AI-powered voice assistant developed by Dag Kittlaus, one of the founders of Siri. Geoffrey Zweig, who heads Microsoft's speech and dialog group, said the next goal of the team is to ensure that voice recognition works in a broad array of real-life settings, whether at a party or with road noise. The team also will try and tackle teaching a machine to distinguish between multiple voices speaking with different accents. But ultimately, the goal indeed not just correctly hear what a human has said, but truly understanding their meaning which in turn could leave to action. “The next frontier is to move from recognition to understanding,” Zweig said.

This button’s primary use is to take you to the very first result of whatever comes up for your search result, a testament to Google’s accuracy in choosing which results to display based on your search terms. It’s amazing. And now, I’m Feeling Lucky has metastasized itself in an entirely different form for the Google Assistant. The latest version of Assistant — only available on forthcoming Pixel phones to start — allows you to tell the digital friend that you’re feeling lucky. What it responds with is pretty cool. It’s a game! A cheesy trivia one, too, like Trivial Pursuit. The Assistant asks how many people you have playing (you and play alone) with you and allows the participants to take turns answering trivia questions. Naturally, whoever has the highest score at the end of the short game wins. It’s nothing amazing from a functionality standpoint, but it’s cool little tricks like these that makes the Google Assistant one of the most exciting reasons to own a Pixel device. PS: No, this won’t work on the preview version of Assistant currently found in Allo, with the AI instead expressing how she’s feeling lucky, too, thanks to her ability to talk to you. Nope, doesn’t work in Allo. Womp, womp.

Now there’s another version of Chrome for those that like to live life on the edge. Google’s Chrome Canary browser is now available on Android. The name is actually “Chrome Canary (Unstable)”, which tells you how experimental the Canary browser is. Google warns that these releases of Chrome have not been tested, so it may be unstable or fail to run at times. Google also says that Chrome Canary is updated frequently, with up to seven releases coming every week. These updates consume a lot of data, so you’ll want to keep an eye on your data usage if you’re running Canary and updating over cellular. Chrome Canary has long been available for desktop users, and so it’s nice to see the browser make its way to Android, too. This browser definitely isn’t for everyone, though. Because it’s so bleeding edge, only developers and advanced users that are willing to put up with bugs in exchange for getting to try new features before everyone else. If you’re ready to live your software life on the edge, you can download Chrome Canary for Android here.

Google applied to operate a number of new generic TLDs, and built Nomulus to help run them." — "Nomulus can manage any number of TLDs in a single shared instance and supports the full range of TLD functionality required by ICANN, including the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), WHOIS, reporting, and trademark protection. It is written in Java and is released under the Apache 2.0 license." –McIlwain — "Donuts collaborates as pressure on registry providers mounts," writes Andrew Allemann in Domain Name Wire: "Donuts, which currently uses Rightside's backend technical services for its roughly 200 domain names, has been contributing to the project for the past 20 months, it revealed today. ... All of this means that Donuts could theoretically drop Rightside (NASDAQ:NAME) and move to Nomulus. But Donuts CEO Paul Stahura said the company has not committed to moving the backend for its top level domain names to Nomulus." — In a press today from Donuts, Paul Stahura said: "the option to evaluate and contribute to the Google Nomulus project presented a unique opportunity. ... Donuts must continually explore compelling technologies and ensure our back-end operations are cost-efficient and flexible. Collaborating with Google on this groundbreaking project is an opportunity to do exactly that." According to the company, Donuts' contributions to Nomulus project included technical specifications for the Domains Protected Marks List (DPML), Early Access Period (EAP) and tiered pricing.

Ars Technica stumbled upon a bit of an Easter Egg in the Pixel’s implementation of Assistant, and it’s pretty bonkers. If you tell the phone “I’m feeling lucky,” it goes into full game show host mode. You can see the feature in action at Ars, but if you can imagine a campy game show host asking you relatively easy questions, you’ll get the gist.

Pixel by Google (Photo: Josmar Taveras, USA TODAY) Story Highlights Pixel by Google: $649 on up; store.google.com Pro. Google Assistant, excellent camera, free cloud photo storage, free support Pro. Daydream ready, fast USB-C charging Con. Not water resistant, only a single speaker. NEW YORK — Google's new Pixel phones should be on a smartphone shopper's short list — and not just for those disheartened by Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall. Pixel is a winner for anyone looking for an excellent phone. Start with cameras that are at the very least on par with the terrific cameras on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7, which represent its main competition. USA TODAY Google Pixel camera: Great but not revolutionary Add the baked-in voice-enabled Google Assistant, Google’s answer to Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa, where another battleground is poised to take place. Such digital assistants still represent a work in progress, including Google Assistant, but Google's voice brings a high IQ and a world of potential. Pixels are also the first phones in which Google took over all aspects of the hardware and software design (though HTC actually manufactured the units), borrowing from Apple’s playbook. Google Pixel XL, the larger version of Google's new Pixel smartphone.  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) Over the past several days, I’ve been testing the larger of the two Pixel models, the Pixel XL, which boasts a lovely Quad HD 5.5-inch display and costs $769 for 32 gigabytes of storage or $869 for 128 GB. The smaller Pixel has a Full HD 5-inch screen and costs $649 or $749, respectively. The phones are already on back order and will be available through Verizon (as the exclusive U.S. carrier), at Best Buy, via Google’s Project Fi or Google’s own Play Store. You can get an unlocked version that will work with any of the other major U.S. carriers. The timing for Google couldn't have been better, coming on the heels of Samsung's decision to stop making the Note 7, a high-end phablet that had attracted a fierce following but which was vulnerable to overheating and fire. The expanded recall may persuade some Android users to try a new brand. Here are the key takeaways: *Design: Pixels are crafted out of an aerospace-grade aluminum slab and glass and the XL model feels like the high-priced phone that it is. It's a tad shorter than the iPhone 7 Plus and, viewed from the front, the two phones look a fair bit alike, though from the rear not so much. The relatively wide bezels on the front appear to be mostly wasted real estate, as there are no physical buttons. On the upper third of the back, Pixel has a Gorilla Glass-covered glass shade that reveals smudges. What I do like is that there’s no camera bump as on most other phones — the rear lens and flash lie flat. The fingerprint sensor you can use to unlock the phone is also on the rear. And when you do unlock the devices, you can swipe down on the sensor to reveal notifications, a small but nice feature. The new fingerprint scanner on the back of the Google Pixel  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) Pixels run the latest version of Android called Nougat and with Google in charge, you ought to get software updates as soon as they are ready. The phone has a robust Qualcomm processor. And score one for Google against the iPhone 7: Pixel has the same standard 3.55mm headphone connector that the iPhone 7 got rid of and that every other smartphone I know has. Alas, there’s only a single speaker on Pixel; Apple added stereo speakers to the iPhone 7 and other smartphones also have them. And unlike the iPhone 7 or ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, you wouldn’t want to drop Pixel in a puddle. It is not fully water-resistant. Using the camera on Pixel. Photo by Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Staff ORG XMIT: RD xxxxx Baig_Google Pixel 10/17/2016 [Via MerlinFTP Drop]  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) *Camera. I detected only subtle differences between the pictures and videos I shot here (under all sorts of lighting conditions) and those I’ve captured on a Galaxy or the iPhone. Consider that high praise. I was impressed with the color and fine detail on most shots. The main rear camera on the Pixel is a 12.3-megapixel shooter with large pixels and an f/2.0 aperture (good in dim light). It is fast to fire. By double-twisting the phone, you can switch from the rear camera to the front 8-megapixel selfie camera or back, a trick that usually (but not always) worked. Maybe as important as the picture quality is what you can do with the images you capture. Google is giving Pixel owners unlimited free cloud storage at full resolution for all the pictures and videos shot with the phone, including 4K video. That’s a big deal. Google Assistant delivers the weather on a Google Pixel.  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) *Google Assistant: You can summon the Google Assistant by barking out “OK Google” or by pressing down and holding against the phone’s home key. As with other digital assistants, it can give you the basics: stock quotes, sports scores, even tell you a lame joke. But Google is pushing the conversational aspects of its AI-based Assistant further. You can tap contextual buttons that appear on the screen with suggested replies, or you can respond by voice. I asked Assistant to “tell me about my day” and it reported my local weather, told me what appointments I had coming and how long my commute would take. Without prompting, it then played radio broadcasts from NPR, Fox, News, Bloomberg and BBC. A Google Assistant search found photos of Edward Baig's daughter Sydney with a horse.  (Photo: Edward C. Baig) When I asked it to show me pictures of Sydney with horses, it correctly surmised that I meant my daughter, Sydney, rather than Sydney, Australia, and found pictures I'd taken of her with horses in my Google Photos stash. When I instead asked the Assistant to “show me pictures of Sydney with bridges” it pulled pictures of the Sydney Harbour Bridge off the Web. Google Assistant was able to translate “how do I find a bathroom in French?” into that language. Given the same query, Siri pointed me to the Web. To be fair, on some complicated requests, the Assistant also directed me to the Web. Google Assistant was able to identify songs where I knew only a few of the lyrics and played them, sometimes, through YouTube. There's a fun aspect to the Assistant, too. I could play trivia, or have Assistant flip a coin with the appropriate sound effect as I tried to guess heads or tails. Most promising is the idea that you can continue a conversation without repeating search parameters each step of the way. So you might ask it to find you an Italian restaurant. You can then can ask how late the place is open, without repeating the name of the restaurant or have Google Assistant find the menu. In my experience, however, such queries were hit-or-miss. Another example: I asked Google to show me pictures of dogs and it did so off the Web. Without mentioning dogs I followed up with "how about by the beach?" and Google surfaced Web images of canines by the beach. Impressive. Pixel help screen  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) *Battery. The phone kept a charge well into the evenings during my mixed use; since I never ran it down, I didn’t get to test a fast-charging feature that Google claims can get you up to seven hours of juice in just 15 minutes, using the USB-C adapter that comes in the box. *Worth noting: If you run into a tech support snag, you can solicit help by tapping a “support” tab inside the phone’s settings. From there, you can request a callback from a support agent 24/7 or alternatively open a chat session (the hours are more limited). You can even remotely share your screen with the person helping you out. Pixel will be the first phone to support Google Daydream, but the mobile virtual-reality headset wasn't yet available for testing. Google's new phones are powerful, pricey and pretty darn intelligent and demonstrate Google's commitment to be a major player in the space.

Google Pixel, LG V20 Android Nougat Handsets Face Off on Features The first smartphones running Android Nougat, the LG V20 and Google Pixel, are coming this month. Here's a look at key features of the two handsets. Screen Size Could Be a Decisive Factor There is some variety in screen sizes for customers to choose. On the V20 side, users will find a 5.7-inch quad-HD screen that comes with Corning's Gorilla Glass 4 to protect it against scratches or minor falls. The Google Pixel comes in two sizes: 5 inches and 5.5 inches. The 5-inch model has a full-HD resolution, while the Pixel XL features quad-HD resolution. Both versions use Gorilla Glass 4. Both Have the Latest Android Nougat Features Both devices ship with Google's latest mobile OS, Android Nougat, and run the same applications, including Google Chrome, Google Play, YouTube and others. At least on software, the LG V20 and Google Pixel experiences will be the same. Fingerprint Sensors for Security Both the Google Pixel and LG V20 come with a fingerprint sensor on their back plates. The feature is designed to let users into their handsets without inputting a code, and can also be used to make secure payments through Android Pay. Anyone worried about hardware-based security, therefore, shouldn't be too concerned about the LG V20 or Google Pixel. Both Feature High-Quality Cameras Google claims that its Pixel will ship with the world's best smartphone camera by offering a 12.3-megapixel camera and large pixels designed to perform well in low and bright light. It also can shoot video in 4K. Similarly, LG touts the V20's rear-facing lens, which has a 135-degree viewing angle and comes with a Steady Record 2.0 feature that's designed to reduce shaking while recording video. LG Gains Advantage With Broad Mobile Carrier Support Google made a somewhat surprising move with the Pixel by partnering only with Verizon. The move means customers who want a monthly installment plan will need to buy it from Verizon. Those who want to run it on any other network will have to buy a Pixel at full price through Google's online store or other e-retailers. LG, however, is selling the device through any of the four major carriers, and customers can use the device on any network for the more affordable monthly installment, if they so choose. The Designs Aren't Groundbreaking Following so many other device makers, neither LG nor Google have delivered new design concepts with their smartphones. In fact, one could argue they're both somewhat ho-hum designs, featuring rounded corners, big screens and large bezels at the top and bottom of their screens. Google's design comes with a metal back plate, but it's not a cut above anything else on the market. The same can be said for the V20. LG Makes an Audio Push LG, which seems to have invested heavily in audio, notes that its device is the first smartphone to support Quad DAC, a technology that offers "cleaner" audio and better streaming-music fidelity. The V20 also has an HD audio recorder that uses three mics to capture audio. Look for the LG V20 to be a better-sounding smartphone. Battery Life Expectancy Competitive for the 2 Handsets Both the LG V20 and Google Pixel come with solid battery lives. The Google Pixel's battery life can last between 26 hours and 32 hours of talk time, depending on the screen size customers choose. With internet usage, the battery can hang in there for up to 14 hours before it requires a recharge. The LG V20 can survive up to 23 hours on a single charge during continuous talk time. LG doesn't say how long the V20 can last while surfing the web. LG Takes the Lead in Data Storage Capacity The LG V20 comes with up to 64GB of internal storage, though that can be boosted with help from a microSD card with a maximum capacity of 2TB. The Google Pixel comes with two on-board storage options—32GB and 128GB—and doesn't come with microSD card expansion. However, Google is offering unlimited and free storage for all photos and videos taken with the Pixel. Broad Differences in Pricing Terms The unlocked Google Pixel comes with a starting price of $649 but jumps to $769 for the larger Pixel XL option. Customers who want 128GB of storage will see the price rise to $869. Customers who don't want to pay full price can get a monthly installment plan through Verizon for a starting price of $27.08. The LG V20 is also available unlocked though its price starts at $830. Customers who want to get it locked to a carrier will pay a monthly installment fee of around $27 to $28.

Both smartphones are scheduled to ship in October and promise solid performance, attractive designs and outstanding image quality, thanks to powerful rear-facing cameras. Most importantly, the V20 and Pixel will ship with Android Nougat, the latest version of Google's mobile operating system. The OS has several new and appealing features, including improved notification support and security enhancements, which could prove to be a major selling point for customers who want the latest software experiences to complement the nice hardware. This means Android mobile phone fans who want to acquire a smartphone with the Nougat experience before the holidays arrive in December likely will have to choose between the LG V20 and Google Pixel, unless there is a late-year smartphone model entry before year's end. The LG V20 and Google Pixel will be the first Nougat models to appear although other vendors say they'll update their devices to run Nougat. This slide show covers the key features in LG's latest high-end smartphone and the Google Pixel to help users choose between the two.           Don Reisinger is a freelance technology columnist.

When the Galaxy S7 (and S7 Edge) first came out, they topped the quality charts for mobile cameras. Now several months old, the S7 family may need to make way for a new emperor of mobile photography in the Pixel. Google Pixel XL features a Sony Exmor IMX378 image sensor. This means it’s picking up 1.55µm-sized pixels in 12.3-megapixel photos. This camera’s lens has a focal length of 4.67 mm and works with an f/2.0 aperture. Of note is the fact that the Google Pixel XL has the exact same camera setup as the non-XL Pixel. Both models should end up performing exactly the same. The Samsung Galaxy S7 uses a Sony Exmor IMX260 image sensor. That is to say that our version of the Galaxy S7 has this image sensor – there are also Galaxy S7 units using ISOCELL. Today’s test is on the IMX-toting version of the Galaxy S7, most common in the USA. The Galaxy S7’s camera array captures 12.2-megapixel photos at 1.4µm pixel size with an f/1.7 aperture. This device’s lens has a focal length of 4.20 mm. Right off the bat it should be clear that the more advanced image sensor and larger focal length will be better. At least, that’s what we would expect based only on specs. First we’ve got a set of photos captured indoors at close range with only yellow light to assist. Here both cameras seem to perform rather similar. You might notice cooler colors in the Pixel XL photo which, in this case, is less accurate than the Galaxy S7. The photo above also shows how the Pixel XL spreads focus over a larger range – top of the cards to the bottom. Below, up close, we see that sharpness in this one area is almost the same. A photo of grass taken in the afternoon on a clear day shows distinct differences between cameras. Galaxy S7 tends to run warm while the Pixel XL goes a bit cooler. The Galaxy S7 view seems to be sharper than the Pixel XL, too. Once we get close, we see that the Galaxy S7’s view of the world is sharp. Maybe even too sharp. Compared to the Pixel’s processing, the Galaxy S7’s photo looks over-sharp and unnatural. In this set of photos taken at dusk, we see that the Galaxy S7 wants to latch on to warmer tones while Pixel XL wants to go cool. This test isn’t super scientific because of the differences in angles and tones vehicles. It does show, though, how well both cameras handle semi-dark scenes with moving objects. While the Galaxy S7’s photo might end up being more pleasing, the Pixel XL seems to stick more to color accuracy. On the other hand, the Galaxy S7’s result is sharper than the Pixel XL. Next is a bunch of rocks photographed by the Galaxy S7 (on the left) and the Pixel XL (on the right). While the Pixel XL seems to get color accuracy points in most areas over the S7, the S7 gets sharper in others. Again – pretty much a toss-up here until we get up close and personal. Once we’re in close, we see that the devil is in the details. The Galaxy S7 seems to get over-sharp in some places, while the Pixel XL stays truer to human sight. Below is a battle of total darkness and flash LEDs in a closet. The images show how the Galaxy S7 found focus closer than the Pixel XL, while both did find a spot to settle on. While light could be more even, both cameras avoid the total wash-out. We live in an age where smartphone cameras give even the worst photographer potential. Each successive release of Sony’s image sensors make for better photos. That’s true even here, with two cameras in the same year. SEE ALSO: Our Pixel XL full review I wouldn’t recommend one of these devices or the other based on the differences in their cameras. They’re far too similar. Instead, it’ll be up to the user to decide if the rest of the phone’s features provide difference enough. If pressed to pick one camera over the other, I’d go for the Pixel XL. That ever-so-slight bump in specs makes the end product just a tiny bit better. Even a little bit of a bump is a success when we get this close.

It will be updated by Mozilla as more information becomes available. Please do not edit this page yourself; if you have proposed changes, email Gerv. The issues are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion. Contents 1 Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) 1.1 WoSign Response 1.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 2 Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) 2.1 WoSign Response 2.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 3 Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) 3.1 WoSign Response 3.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 4 Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) 4.1 WoSign Response 4.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 5 Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) 5.1 WoSign Response 5.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 6 Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) 6.1 WoSign Response 6.1.1 Bug N1 6.1.2 Bug N2 6.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 7 Issue O: Intermediates with Duplicate Serial Numbers (May - July 2015) 7.1 WoSign Response 7.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 8 Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) 8.1 WoSign Response 8.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 9 Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) 9.1 WoSign Response 9.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 10 Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) 10.1 WoSign Response 10.2 Further Comments 11 Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) 11.1 WoSign Response 11.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 12 Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) 12.1 WoSign Response 12.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 13 Issue X: Unpatched Software (September 2016) 13.1 WoSign Response 13.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 14 Cross Signing Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusion WoSign say that they were aware that they were doing this, and that the cause was a delay in implementing the changes from CAB Forum ballot 118. Ballot 118 was passed on 16th October 2014, but WoSign were unable to update their systems until March 5th 2015, nearly five months later. This seems like a surprisingly long delay for a relatively simple change, given how quickly WoSign have been able to update their systems in other cases. However, as noted above, this is not a BR violation. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. They explain that there are 16 examples, and it happens when their Certificate Management System loses contact with a signing server during a transaction, and so tries the other one, but both signing servers issue a certificate. One was sent to the subscriber, and the other was stored in their records, and then logged to CT when they logged all their certs. WoSign has since updated their system to use better locking. Further Comments and Conclusion Issuing two different certs with the same serial number is a violation of the RFC, but the impact of this bug is minimal. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. They explain that there were two bugs which led to the same result - one involving a system which did not understand serial numbers with leading zeroes, and the other a race condition. Further Comments and Conclusion This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. It's not clear how "a system bug with the serial number generation, generating a serial number starting with “0” in the first left position" combined with "the signing system had a bug that didn’t know how to deal with this kind of serial number" could lead to duplicate serial numbers. Further clarification has been requested on this point. This incident is unfortunate and an RFC violation, but it was detected fairly promptly (albeit not by WoSign themselves) and fixed. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusion WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. There is also the question of whether Mozilla wishes to continue to accept audits from an auditor who misses CPS violations covering such a large proportion of the certificate corpus. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusion It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. However, the final incident report still gives the impression that WoSign was able to generate a complete list. WoSign has since stopped doing website validation; if they had continued, better logging of the process would have been necessary. The logs they were keeping while using this process were clearly inadequate. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. WoSign discovered the github misissuances due to a post-issuance review the following day, triggered by "github" being on their list of high-value domains. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. Thanks to Stephen Schrauger for reporting this issue. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments and Conclusion An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw, particularly if it's available in a normal workflow. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. WoSign has since stopped doing website control validation entirely. However, that does not decrease the seriousness of the bug/feature. It also raises the question of how such a feature could make it through review, testing and QA. Issue O: Intermediates with Duplicate Serial Numbers (May - July 2015) WoSign has issued two pairs of intermediates with the same issuer duplicate serial numbers - one pair with a notBefore in May 2015, and one pair with a notBefore in July 2015. All four certificates were issued by WoSign's "CA 沃通根证书" root. This is a violation of RFC 5280. One of each pair has CRL and OCSP URLs with domains such as cr.wscrl.cn, oc.wsocsp.cn and ai.wscrl.cn. These domains no longer exist. The other one of each pair has CRL and OCSP URLs at subdomains of wosign.cn; these subdomains do exist, and point to either Akamai's CDN or what appears to be Qihoo 360's CDN. In the case of one of the pairs, the first cert was logged in the 'pilot' CT log about a month before the second one. One possibility is that WoSign was planning to adopt one strategy for CRL and OCSP hosting, and then changed strategy, which necessitated re-issuing the intermediates with new URLs. If that is the case, it raises the question of why the notBefore date for both certificates is the same. Thanks to Kurt Roeckx and Rob Stradling for their help with this issue. WoSign Response By private mail, Richard Wang of WoSign said that the plan was to use a CDN with a different domain, but in discussions with the CDN provider there was no need to change domain, so they changed the plan to use the existing domain and reissued the intermediate certificate. At that point, they "forgot to change the serial number". The old one issued only test certificates for two months. WoSign plan to revoke "this two intermediate CA and all issued certificates soon" (by which I assume he means the two certificates with the older domain names). Further Comments and Conclusion Given that intermediates are issued manually rather than in an automated fashion, and should normally be surrounded by strong controls as they involve issuance directly from the root, reusing a serial number for two intermediates shows a disappointing lack of care and appropriate processes. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Their later final statement document says: "being a Chinese licensed CA, we must abide by local laws and regulations, we must actively cooperate with domestic browsers to test the SSL certificate using SM2 algorithm issued by a global trusted root in the real Internet, not intranet." Further Comments and Conclusion There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots - and, in fact, WoSign has said they have updated their systems to avoid issuing test certificates from public roots in future. Mozilla is sceptical of the claim that Chinese law or regulation required WoSign to issue these certificates. However, if that were true, the Baseline Requirements contain a mechanism (section 9.16.3) by which a CA can break the BRs if required to do so by local law, with appropriate disclosure to the CAB Forum. That was not done in this case. We note that Symantec was penalised in late 2015 for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Their problems were first revealed in September, and one big discussion of these problems happened in m.d.s.policy starting on 13th October 2015. All of these dates are prior to WoSign's test certificate misissuances. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which we believe violates section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. Furthermore, when this clause was brought to their attention, they denied that any changes fell under it, and they attempted to suppress further information about the ownership transfer when it was brought to the community's attention. Full details can be found in the post in mozilla.dev.security.policy. WoSign Response Richard Wang writes: "An announcement and disclosure will be made shortly pending completion of the business transaction. We can provide the proof documents to Mozilla to show this transaction is not finished if Mozilla think it is necessary." On 2016-09-19, WoSign issued a press release saying that they have "made an equity investment" in StartCom CA. Further Comments and Conclusion Mozilla has confirmed with a Hebrew-speaking lawyer that, as far as the Israeli company authorities are concerned, the transaction which completed the chain to give WoSign 100% ownership of StartCom completed on November 1st 2015. We maintain that this is the date at which the ownership change should have been disclosed to Mozilla. In addition, WoSign's press release about their "equity investment" seems to be economical with the truth; WoSign owns 100% of StartCom. The statement that "WoSign and StartCom [are] two companies operate[d] and managed independently" is hard to square with the fact that the same person is sole director of StartCom and CEO of WoSign. Also, there is technical evidence that StartCom are now using a large part of WoSign's issuance infrastructure. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2015, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. Of the 64 certificates they consider, WoSign attribute 6 to a dual-issuance bug, 9 they say are not problematic because they were issued on December 31st 2015, 2 are the mis-issued certs relating to Issue V, and the other 47 are "normal SHA-1 orders". Further Comments Mozilla is seeking further information on the details in WoSign's report and will make further comment at a later date. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which was not requested by the owner of that domain. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. WoSign assert that they completed the domain control checks correctly. Further Comments and Conclusion The owners of alicdn.com have confirmed directly to Mozilla that this incident was caused by an attacker being able to control content on their domain. We would have some concerns with how WoSign's systems validated website control. However, they no longer support this method. This "misissuance" was possible only because alicdn.com was, for some period of time, controlled by an attacker. Therefore, no blame can be attributed to WoSign for the misissuance itself. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusion This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open. Issue X: Unpatched Software (September 2016) The first WoSign incident report, produced in response to other issues listed on this page, has a screenshot of a dig query from their validation server. The dig program is part of the bind-utils package, and the output of dig appears to show a bind-utils version of 9.7.3-8.P3.el6. The "el6" shows that this is a version built for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This version of bind-utils was released in December 2011 and so is very out of date. The next release of this package for EL6 following the one WoSign are using is bind-utils 9.7.3-8.P3.el6_2.1, which was released a little later in December 2011. The most recent version is 9.8.2-0.47.rc1.el6, which was released on the 10th of May 2016. There are 19 patched CVEs between the version WoSign is suspected of running and the current version. None of these CVEs are especially severe. However, if this software is in fact that far out of date (nearly five years), it raises questions about the overall patch level of their verification server and even their other infrastructure. WoSign's most recent audit used the "SSL Baseline With Network Security - Version 2.0" criteria. These criteria integrate two CA/Browser Forum Documents - the SSL BRs and the Network & Certificate Systems Security Requirements. A bullet on page 19 of the Network Security Requirements requires that "Recommended security patches are applied to Certificate Systems within six months of the security patch’s availability, unless the CA documents that the security patch would introduce additional vulnerabilities or instabilities that outweigh the benefits of applying the security patch." That appears not to be true of their version of bind, and so may well not be true of other more critical packages on their systems. We would expect the presence of badly outdated software and the lack of an appropriate patching regime to have been caught by WoSign's auditors. Thanks to Paul Pearce for his help with this issue. WoSign Response WoSign's most recent incident report acknowledged the issue and they committed to updating the OS on the server(s) in question. Further Comments and Conclusion N/A.

Chrome Canary is the cutting edge version of the Chrome web browser by Google which has just been available for desktop devices previously. Chrome users on Android who wanted to run development versions of the web browser had to use the beta or developer edition of Chrome for that until now. The release of Chrome Canary for Android changes that as it makes available the most cutting edge but also the least stable version of Chrome. The Google Play store listing of Chrome Canary lists the release as unstable. If you read on, you will notice further warnings. In particular, that the release has not been tested, and that it may be unstable, or fail to run at times. Chrome Canary for Android Additionally, Google warns that Chrome Canary for Android will be updated frequently. The company states that Chrome Canary may receive up to seven updates per week, and that updates may consume 100 Megabyte of bandwidth. This can be particularly troublesome for Android users on limited plans who have configured Chrome to update over cellular data as well. Chrome Canary is the first version of Chrome that receives improvements and changes. These are then carried over to the Dev version of Chrome, then Beta, and finally to the Stable release version of the browser. This means that it is ideal for enthusiasts, developers, and anyone else interested in running the most up to date version of Google Chrome on Android. Developers can test sites or applications with Chrome Canary earlier now than before, as Canary gets new feature additions and improvements before the Dev build. The Chrome Canary page does not list compatibility information, only that it varies with devices. The browser installed fine on a Android 5.1.1 device. Developers and enthusiasts can install Chrome Canary for Android next to other Chrome versions for Android. In fact, it is possible to install all four Chrome version -- Stable, Beta, Dev and Canary -- on the same device and use them independently of each other. Now You: Do you run Chrome on your mobile device or another browser? Summary Article Name Google releases Chrome Canary for Android Description Google has just released the cutting edge version of Google Chrome, Chrome Canary for Android so that all four versions of Chrome are now available.

Which percentage of the software did you pay for? 50%? 20%? 0%? Chances are if you’re anything like me, most of the software you use, you got for free. I use almost exclusively open source software. Just because I use free software, however, does not mean that the software did not come at a cost. Thousands of developer hours went into each piece of software I use. Free or not, good software makes our lives better. That is why we use it. So what can we do to give back to the developers who are adding value to our lives? A thank you email perhaps? Donate via PayPal to the developers (even better)? Become a ravenous fan who tweets and instagrams incessantly about the awesome software? I would argue that one of the best ways we can support the software we love is by showing an interest in the development of the software by submitting bug reports. So next time you are bugged by a bug (see what I did there?), consider taking a more proactive approach than complaining or throwing your computer out the window, and actually take the time to report the bug. What is a bug? Everyone that has used software has run into a bug. According to what someone wrote on the Wikipedia article for a software bug, “A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.” Most of the time a bug is a source of minor (or major) annoyance. Sometimes bugs are so severe that they can cause us to stop using certain software altogether. While spending the last year doing quality assurance for Lucid Software, I realized that finding and reporting bugs does not always have to be a nuisance; in fact, it can be quite empowering. The reason why I believe that everyone should report bugs is that finding and reporting a bug can empower a user to help make the software they use everyday better. Before you start reporting bugs left and right, I would like to guide you through some things that I have learned that make reporting a bug effective and consequently increases the likelihood of the bug actually getting fixed. How to report a bug. Step 1: Try to reproduce the bug to make sure that it is indeed a bug and not a user or environment error. This might seem like an obvious first step but I have surprised myself with how many times I would be in the process of reporting a bug then halfway through try to reproduce the bug only to realize it was either a user error on my part or an environment issue. If you cannot reproduce the bug you found, there is a good chance that it is not actually a bug.   Step 2: Check if the bug has already been reported. Once you have verified that you indeed have found a bug, you should see if the bug is already documented or reported. For popular software it is probable that the bug you have found has already been reported. Aside from doing a direct Google search for your specific bug, one thing you can do is go to the bugs page for the software you are looking at and see if the bug has already been reported. Most software you are using will have a page dedicated to finding bugs. For example, if you do a Google search for “photoshop bugs,” the first link that will come up is Adobe’s bug reporting page. If a bug report already exists, that is great. You might even find a solution or workaround to the bug you are experiencing. If you cannot find an existing bug then you can create a new bug report. If a bug has already been reported, you should not create an additional bug report. You should, however, read through the bug and write any additional comments that might help the developer to resolve the bug. Step 3: Report the bug (or make a comment on an existing bug report). Any developer will attest that not all bug reports are created equal. While a good bug report increases the likelihood of the bug getting fixed, a bad bug report can be a waste of time for everyone involved, and can result in confusion and annoyance. Bugzilla has a detailed list of the anatomy of a bug, detailing fields to be included in a bug report. I won’t go over all these fields, but I will share my personal list of what I think every effective bug report should have. Descriptive title Environment Expected Behavior Actual Behavior Steps to reproduce Demonstration of bug Note: For all of the examples below I will list an actual bug that I encounter all too frequently while using the (sadly) now discontinued Picasa photo viewer from Google. Descriptive Title When you searched for the bug (remember step two) what words did you type to do a search? These are probably the same words you should include in your bug report title so that other people can easily search for and find the bug report. Think of words or phrases that might often be worded differently and include both wordings in the title. Avoid using ambiguous words like “broken” or “not working.” That is implicit in the fact that it is a bug. Specifically mention how something is not working. A well written title can often be sufficient for the bug to be fixed. Example: Picasa 3.9 in Ubuntu crashes when clicking the link “Sign in with Google account.” The window closes and an error report comes up. In my example I include the environment and list what is happening. While “crashes” and “window closes” can be synonymous, I include both phrasings just in case someone were to search for one phrasing but not the other. While you don’t want to make the title a long run on sentence, it is good to be descriptive enough so that it is clear what the bug is. Environment Often bugs only happen in certain environments so it is good to be as specific as possible. Make sure to list the operating system or browser you are using, and if applicable, which version of software and hardware you are using. If you are able to, help out the developer by testing on multiple environments to see if the bug is present in multiple environments or not. Example: Ubuntu-Gnome version 16.04.1. Running Picasa from PlayOnLinux Here I make it clear that I am not running this software in Windows. Expected Behavior Before writing what the bug is, it is useful to write what you expect to happen. If you just write the bug, the person reading it might not be totally clear if you are describing a bug or the desired behavior. Bugs are often “features.” It can sometimes be a matter of opinion. It is never clear what the bug is unless it is clear what the bug is not. Example: When I click on the “Sign in with Google account” link, it should open a window allowing me to sign in. Actual or observed behavior This is the meat of the bug report and often the only thing that people write when they report a bug. Often, this is just the opposite of what you wrote previously for the expected behavior. When you write the bug, remember to avoid using ambiguous terms like “broken,” “not working,” etc. Make Victor Hugo proud. Go crazy on the detail. A reader can skip reading detail but cannot make up what is never written. If there are too many things that are not working as you would expect them to, consider creating multiple bugs (or a parent bug with sub-bugs). Example: When I click on the “Sign in with Google account” link, the window closes and I must reopen Picasa. I get an error report that says that PlayOnLinux crashed. Steps to reproduce If I had to pick one thing that EVERY bug report should have, it would be steps to reproduce. Listing step by step how to reproduce the bug usually makes everything else clear. Listing the steps to reproduce the bug can make it more obvious what environment you are using, what you expect to happen, and what is actually happening. In my mind, if you have not found a way to consistently reproduce the bug, then you have not really found a bug; you have found a user error. Each step should be documented so that anyone can clearly reproduce the bug you have. Example: Double click on the Picassa icon in Playonlinux to open Picasa. In the top right hand corner of the main Picasa window click on the link that says “Sign in with Google account.” Notice that the main Picasa window closes and I get an error message. Evidence or demonstration of the bug I like to record some evidence of this bug. This does a few things: 1) It requires me to be able to reproduce it consistently. 2) It serves as evidence that there is in fact a bug and it is not a tester’s error. 3) It shows a clear picture for the developer to see what is going on. Screenshots with annotations are often sufficient but in cases where there is user input or action, I like to show the whole process in a gif. I try to keep all my gifs under 30 seconds. If I can’t keep it under 30 seconds, I practice recreating the bug until I can do it more quickly, or I break the gif into multiple gifs. Example:   There are a handful of great free programs to help record a gif screencast. My favorite software for this is ShareX (which sadly is only available in Windows). Linux users can use Peek. LiceCap works well in Windows and MacOS and can even be used in Linux through Wine. One thing to keep in mind when reporting a bug is that the bug report most likely will not be for you. Pay attention to who the audience might be; someone new to the project, an intern, a tester, someone online having the same experience as you, etc. Additional tips when reporting a bug: Look for an existing bug report before reporting the bug. Proofread any bug report before you submit it. Incorrect grammar or wording can be very confusing and discouraging. Provide as much relevant info as you can. This can include error logs and URLs. Look for an existing bug report before reporting the bug. Be as specific and concise as possible (without leaving out relevant details). Test in multiple environments if you expect it to be an environment issue. Look for an existing bug report before reporting the bug. Avoid opinions. Unless you are submitting a feature request, you should stick to the facts and leave out how you would make the software if you were the developer. Look for an existing bug report before reporting the bug. Seeing duplicate bug reports can be as annoying for a developer or product manager as it is to see duplicate bullet points in this list. Step 4: Be proactive and follow up If you really want a bug to be resolved one of the best things you can do is follow up with the bug report (but in a nice, proactive way). After filing the bug report, or in the bug report itself, you can make a comment to the developer and state your willingness to help. One nice thing to do would be to add words of encouragement to the developer to show that you appreciate the software. Something else you can do is offer to test in different environment or even test beta versions of the software. A developer that feels appreciated is much more likely to fix a bug than a developer who feels annoyed. Remember that when writing a bug report and following up. Why everyone should report bugs As I stated earlier in this article. Reporting bugs can empower you as a user to help make software better; it is probably one of the best things a non-developer can do to help improve software. Even before working at Lucid, I often would send emails to developers with bugs that I had found. I was always surprised and impressed with the response that I received. I almost always received a reply and in the end, the developer would either fix the bug or explain to me why it would not (or could not) be fixed. Someone who sits idly by waiting for bugs to be fixed is most likely someone who will be disappointed. Someone who reports bugs is someone who shows that they care enough to support the best possible product outcome. So the next time you are using software and you encounter a bug, make the extra effort and report it. Being proactive will not only benefit you in the long run, but will also benefit everyone who uses that software and ultimately improve the world of IT.

Thank you for sharing such an informative content. There are various tools that will help you in resolving bug easily, available at https://betapage.co/ check them out 🙂 This is just a suggestion. Rena says: October 19, 2016 at 6:57 am Bug report: Your example bug report doesn’t include information about your hardware. Environment: https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/2016/10/18/how-to-write-an-effective-bug-report-that-actually-gets-resolved-and-why-everyone-should/ in Icecat 38.8.0 on Arch Linux AMD64 Expected Behavior: Sample bug report should include details about the hardware the bug was encountered on, as described in the post. Actual Behavior: Report describes the software environment but not the hardware. Steps to reproduce: 1. Read this article. 2. Observe missing hardware information in Environment section of sample report. Demonstration of bug: http://imgur.com/a/OdkQV Tim says: October 19, 2016 at 8:17 am I think your flowchart should add a section for “Does this developer actually fix bugs that are reported against it?” Many programs I use have gobs of bugs reported against them, but developers are uninterested in fixing any of the ones that matter to me. There’s one major open-source project (let’s call it “X”) that I use, by necessity. If I had a dollar a month for every open “X” bug I’ve filed against or commented on, I could quit my job. I’ve got lots of “X” bugs that are more than 10 years old now. They just don’t bother. They’re more interested in adding new features (especially related to “the cloud”) than fixing bugs. Honestly I’ve not seen any use in reporting bugs, for the past couple years. There’s so many people using software that it’s almost certain that somebody else has already found and reported it. The problem is fixing them, not finding them. Derek Broughton says: October 19, 2016 at 8:21 am Unfortunately, too often, nobody cares. I reported https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99709 in 2005, and the bug was still known to exist six years later. It appears to have eventually disappeared through no actual action on the bug (and the bug is still technically open…) I stopped reporting bugs against that component of KDE, and eventually stopped using it altogether, because year after year new releases came with the same old bugs. In another case, I reported a bug (and this exists in multiple desktop environments) where when the machine is suspended or hibernated, the screen is blanked ON RESUME, rather than before suspension. This can leave sensitive information appearing on the screen for seconds after resumption (quite long enough to photograph it). Even WIndows understands that this is a security bug, but I was literally told that the developers didn’t care, as it doesn’t actually prevent doing work. I’m not sure which I care for less, FOSS developers who provide easy ways to report bugs, but ignore them, or monoliths like Google or Microsoft who just give you no way to report a bug. Tom Miller says: October 19, 2016 at 10:12 am Excellent! Much needed clarity and completeness! Bravo! Really, you have addressed all the important bits, including for example, “A developer that feels appreciated is much more likely to fix a bug than a developer who feels annoyed.” Testers, shame your developers at your peril! Megha says: October 19, 2016 at 12:01 pm Well written article Mckay, This is how i was taught by my Test lead when i started my career as Quality Assurance Engineer in 2005. Jane Prusakova says: October 19, 2016 at 5:17 pm If the perceived bad behavior of software is caused by environmental issue or user error – it is still a bug, a usability bug. It is worth reporting as such, so that the developers can take the concern to the product owner and UX folks, and hummer out a better interface for the user. jeff says: October 20, 2016 at 2:44 am very nice, thanks Marlon Almeida says: October 20, 2016 at 9:21 pm Great post!! Thanks for sharing your experience! T-bone says: October 21, 2016 at 8:06 am This article is brilliant. Thank you, thank you. JSM says: October 24, 2016 at 8:48 am At my company, bugs are called “features”. LOL! McKay Christensen says: October 24, 2016 at 11:31 pm Thanks for your comments! McKay Christensen says: October 25, 2016 at 10:10 am Rena – Thanks for your comment! Brilliantly done. Tim – Sorry you have not had a good experience reporting bugs. If direct contact is available, that might help. You are right though; unfortunately a lot of times things just don’t get fixed. Derek – I have noticed the very bug you are talking about. It is a bummer nothing has been done about it. Jane – You bring up a good point. Even if things are not technically bugs it can help to report things that can be fixed with better UX. Amy says: November 11, 2016 at 2:01 pm There is certainly a great deal to know about this issue. I like all the points you made. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel, Pixel XL listed on Google Store but now out of stock By R Padla - October 18, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Say what you want about the new Pixel and Pixel XL but there’s no stopping these two new Google-branded phones from making a splash in the mobile industry. It may be too early to judge but the Pixel has a big potential to sell more than the Nexus. Well, Google can advertise the smartphones more but beyond marketing, the Pixel can show the world what it means to be really known as a Google phone. The phones are now listed on Google Store but sadly, they are already unavailable. We’re assuming just out of stock because of a high demand and not out of stock because there are not enough units ready on hand. The Pixel XL is still up for purchase but with four to five weeks of wait time. If you can no longer wait, you can also pre-order for one at Best Buy and Verizon Wireless. On Google Store, the Pixel phone is listed with a $649 price tag but with Google Store Financing, it can be had with a $27.04 monthly fee for 24 months. Google Store Financing isn’t the usual instalment plan. It’s actually a new credit card account provided by Synchrony Bank in the US. If you have plans of buying from store.google.com, you can try to apply for a Google Store Financing account. See if you can avail of this service so you can get the Pixel phone with zero interest on credit. The Pixel and Pixel XL are each available in three color options: Very Silver, Quite Black, and the Limited Edition Really Blue. You can choose between the 32GB or 128GB variant.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The Google Pixel officially launches in two days. Reviews of Google’s new smartphone went live this morning, including our own Google Pixel review. While I liked the smartphone, it’s not one that I’m going to buy for myself. If you listen to the podcast or follow along with me, I buy a lot of phones. I return a lot of them, too. I usually like to buy a device to understand what the rage is about. To put myself in the shoes of consumers. To understand what it is to *own* a product. The Google Pixel has been tempting, no doubt, but I won’t buy it. Google Assistant wasn’t as impressive as I’d thought it would be. Often, she didn’t understand what I was saying. Or she wouldn’t answer to “OK Google” at all. While the support may be coming later, I wasn’t able to control my Philips Hue lights, a task Siri does. GPS locked up while I was driving, and I ran into a host of other bugs before I performed a hard reset. Maybe I had a bum unit? But that’s not all. I also found the device uninspired. The hardware is boring, yawn-worthy even. It does little to stand out from the pack of familiar candy bar smartphones. I tested the smaller Google Pixel, which could easily be mistaken for an iPhone from the front. Android, to me, has always been about hardware innovation. Styluses, crazy displays, IR blasters, removable batteries, microSD expansion slots, water-proofing, iris scanners. You’ll find none of that here. I admit the camera and battery life are great, but you can find that elsewhere. So, really, the Pixel boils down to the software experience. To me, it just didn’t justify the price. I seem to be at odds with other reviewers, though. The Verge called the Google Pixel a “home run.” Android Central said it “can’t think of a better phone to buy.” Business Insider said it’s “the best of Android and the best alternative to Android.” I appreciate the point of view in those reviews, which is why you’ll find it valuable to read more than just one. Maybe my mind will be swayed in the future. Google will continue to add new features and accessories, like the Daydream View VR. If you’re on the fence, I list a few alternatives to the Google Pixel in our review that might be worth considering. For now, I’ll be using the Moto Z.

SUBSCRIBE 3 things to do after a major Google algorithm update Heard about a new update to Google's organic search ranking algorithm? Don't panic! Columnist Ryan Shelley shares his tips for responding to these updates in a calm and constructive way. Ryan Shelley on October 18, 2016 at 10:06 am More The only constant in the world of SEO is change. In fact, Google is reported to change its search algorithm around 500 to 600 times each year.  While most of these updates are small and often aren’t even picked up by users and SEO, every once in a while, Google releases major updates. Over the past two years alone, we’ve seen about nine major updates to the algorithm. The two most recent, “Possum” (released on September 1, 2016) and Penguin 4.0 (released on September 23, 2016) caused a lot of stir in the SEO community. Over my years in the SEO community, I’ve watched as updates like Caffeine and Vince in 2009, Panda/Farmer in 2011, the Exact-Match Domain (EMD) Update and Penguin in 2012, Pigeon in 2014 and the others discussed above shook up rankings and shifted the way SEOs approached their job. Early in my career, I would read post after post and allow the anxiety of the unknown throw me into a panic. But not anymore. Nowadays, I have three simple guidelines I use to help make sure I don’t overreact — and that I do make the right move for my site and my clients. 1. Don’t panic Major algorithm updates can be stressful, I get it. But the truth is we never get a detailed list of changes from Google. So panicking about something we know little about, especially in the beginning, is really a waste of time and energy. Let’s take the most recent Penguin update, for instance. With the release of Penguin 4.0, Google did share information about the update via the Google Webmaster Central Blog. While a number of changes were made, they did give us a couple of explicit details that provide some insight on what to expect: Penguin is now real-time. Penguin is now more granular. Now, before knowing this information, many speculated what this update would bring. Some were right, others not so much. But one thing is for sure. If you panicked about the update and started trying to “guess” what was coming, you probably did a lot of unnecessary worrying. So when you learn a major update is looming, don’t panic. 2. Wait to react After relaxing and not panicking, the next thing to do is wait to react. It can be tempting to go out and make changes to your site or process, but that could be wasted work. Instead, the smart thing to do is wait and see if your site has been impacted. More often than not, if you are doing SEO the right way, your site was probably not impacted negatively (and you could even see a boost). Google is on a mission to deliver the best answers to their users. That’s why they are constantly changing their algorithm to push webmasters to create better sites, experiences and content. These updates are about more than just messing with SEOs. In fact, Google believes SEO is important. What they want to crush is black-hat SEO webspam. Before overreacting to an algorithm update, I recommend you wait a few days or even weeks to see the impact on your site or sites. Make a note of where you are at the beginning and compare the metrics after a few weeks. If your site appears to be impacted, that’s when it’s time to make changes. 3. Read credible sources and make adjustments where necessary So you’ve not panicked, waited to see the impact and realized you need to make some adjustments. Where to get started is often the hardest decision. Checking and reading the Google Webmaster Blog is a great place to start. Read over any information they have posted, and look at what the update was meant to target. If your site was hit, it’s likely these are the things you need to work on. If you still need more, Search Engine Land has a number of great staff writers and columnists who cover all the algorithm updates very well. As we did above, let’s look at the other recent update, Possum. Possum was targeted at local SEO, looking to diversify listings and remove spam. While Google never wrote about this update on their Webmaster Blog, there was enough shake-up in the local results to trigger the SEO community. When these types of changes are made to the algorithm without direct admission from the team at Google, it can be very unnerving. This is where we need to rely on other experts. Columnist Joy Hawkins did a great research-based piece on Possum, where she shared five things that were impacted by the update and what you should look for as an SEO or site owner. Since Hawkins put in the hard work and tested the impacts, you can be pretty sure that her insights are right on. The key here is this: when Google doesn’t give you the breakdown, only go to sites that have credibility. There are many out there who do things that can get you short-term results but crush your site’s long-term viability in the end. When making adjustments to your site after an update, make sure you make one change at a time. That way, you can see the impact of the adjustment and have a better idea of what is actually going on. Final thoughts Major algorithm updates can be scary. But if you are doing SEO right — like creating good, user-focused content and earning links from credible and niche-specific sites — you should be okay. If you’re buying links and spinning content, well, Google is after you. When you are alerted of a major update, stay calm, wait to see the impacts and make calculated adjustments if needed. We may not know all the factors Google uses to rank, but we do know their mission, which is to provide the most accurate answer in the shortest amount of time. Focus on your users and their needs, and over time you’ll reap the benefits. Some opinions expressed in this article may be those of a guest author and not necessarily Search Engine Land.

SUBSCRIBE How Google uses machine learning in its search algorithms Gary Illyes of Google tells us Google may use machine learning to aggregate signals together for better search quality, and with RankBrain. Barry Schwartz on October 18, 2016 at 10:40 am More One of the biggest buzzwords around Google and the overall technology market is machine learning. Google uses it with RankBrain for search and in other ways. We asked Gary Illyes from Google in part two of our interview how Google uses machine learning with search. Illyes said that Google uses it mostly for “coming up with new signals and signal aggregations.” So they may look at two or more different existing non-machine-learning signals and see if adding machine learning to the aggregation of them can help improve search rankings and quality. He also said, “RankBrain, where … which re-ranks based on based on historical signals,” is another way they use machine learning, and later explained how RankBrain works and that Penguin doesn’t really use machine learning. Here is the audio file: Here is the full transcript: Danny Sullivan: These days it seems like it’s really cool for people to just say machine learning is being used in everything. Gary Illyes: And then people freak out. Danny Sullivan: Yeah. What is it, what are you doing with machine learning? Like, so when you say it’s not being used in the core algorithm. So no one’s getting fired. The machines haven’t taken over the algorithm, you guys are still using an algorithm. You still have people trying to figure out the best way to process signals, and then what do you do with the machine learning; is [it] part of that? Gary Illyes: They are typically used for coming up with new signals and signal aggregations. So basically, let’s say that this is a random example and not know if this is real, but let’s say that I would want to see if combining PageRank with Panda and whatever else, I don’t know, token frequency. If combining those three in some way would result in better ranking, and for that for example, we could easily use machine learning. And then create the new composite signal. That would be one example. The other example would be RankBrain, where… which re-ranks based on based on historical signals. But that also is, if you, if you think about it, it’s also a composite signal. It’s using several signals to come up with a new multiplier for the results that are already ranked by the core algorithm. What else? Barry Schwartz: Didn’t you first use it as a query refinement? Right? That’s the main thing? Gary Illyes: I don’t know that … ? Barry Schwartz: Wasn’t RankBrain all about some type of query understanding and… Gary Illyes: Well, making sure that for the query we are the best possible result, basically, it is re-ranking in a way. Barry Schwartz: Danny, did you understand RankBrain to mean, maybe it was just me, to mean, alright someone searched for X, but RankBrain really makes [it] into Xish? And then the queries would be the results. Danny Sullivan: When it first came out, my understanding was [that] RankBrain was being used for long-tail queries to correspond them to short short answers. So somebody comes along and says, Why is the tide super-high sometimes, when I don’t understand — the moon seemed to be very big, and that’s a very unusual query, right? And Google might be going, OK, there’s a lot going on here. How do unpack this and to where, and then getting the confidence and using typical things where you’d be like, OK, we’ll see if we have all these words you have a link to whatever. Meanwhile, really what the person is saying is why is the tide high when the moon is full. And that is a more common query. And Google probably has much more confidence in what it’s ranking when it deals with that, and my understanding [is that] RankBrain helped Google better understand that these longer queries coresponded basically to the shorter queries where it had a lot of confidence about the answers. That was then, that was like what, a year ago or so? At this point, Gary, when you start talking that re-ranking, is that the kind of the re-ranking you’re talking about? Gary Illyes: Yeah. Danny Sullivan: OK. Barry Schwartz: All right. So we shouldn’t be classifying all these things as RankBrain, or should we? Like it could be other machine learning. Gary Illyes: RankBrain is one component in our ranking system. There are over 200, as we said in the beginning, signals that we use and what each of them might become like machine learning-based. But when you or I don’t expect that any time soon or in the foreseeable future all of them would become machine learning based. Or that’s what we call the core algorithm would become machine learning-based. The main reason for that is that debugging machine learning decisions or AI decisions, if you want, if you like, is incredibly hard, especially when you have … multiple layers of neural networks. It becomes close to impossible to debug a decision. And that’s very bad for us. And for that we try to develop new ways to to track back decisions. But if it can easily obfuscate issues, and that would limit our with our ability to improve search in general. Barry Schwartz: So when people say Penguin is now an old machine learning-based… Gary Illyes: Penguin is not ML. Barry Schwartz: OK, there’s a lot of people saying that Penguin [is] machine learning-based. Gary Illyes: Of course they do. I mean if you think about it, it’s a very sexy word. Right. And if you publish it… Danny Sullivan: People use it in bars and online all the time. Like hey, machine learning. Oh yeah. Gary Illyes: But basically, if you publish an article with a title like machine learning is now in Penguin or Penguin generated by machine learning it’s like…. But if you publish an article with that title it’s much more likely that people could click on that title, and well, probably come up with the idea that you are insane or something like that. But it’s much more likely they would visit your site than if you publish something with a title Penguin has launched. Note: This article was pre-written and scheduled to be published today.

SUBSCRIBE Google Assistant is only an incremental advance over current voice search High expectations made me want it to do more and be more naturally conversational. But that will come. Greg Sterling on October 18, 2016 at 9:01 am More You want it to do more. That was my feeling about the Google Assistant after using the new Pixel XL for several days. The Pixel is a very nice phone with a great camera and a beautiful screen. It’s going to be a hit. But an iPhone killer it is not. Google is promoting the Pixel as “The first phone with the Google Assistant built in.” The Google Assistant is useful and holds great promise, but in this “1.0” version, Google has oversold it. What you get is a user experience identical to what Google is delivering in Allo, but with voice playback. Allo’s version of the Assistant is mute. Danny Sullivan discusses what he feels are shortcomings around Google Assistant usability on MarketingLand. He focuses on the fact that you can’t manually type a question into Google Assistant; it can only be initiated by voice. My frustrations were not focused on that issue so much as the fact that you can’t hold a true “conversation” with the Assistant. To invoke Google Assistant, you can either use “OK Google,” as you can today to trigger a voice command or search query, or you touch the microphone icon or or one of the “follow-up” buttons (image below). My greatest frustration was that each command or query had to be separately initiated. Putting the buttons aside, users need to touch the mic or say “OK Google” again before each new search or follow-up. And while the Assistant understands pronouns and context, you can’t have the kind of multi-step interaction with the Assistant I had hoped. I wanted to just keep talking, without these “manual” search interactions. To be clear, however, my criticisms come from very high expectations. If your first experience with voice search were to be the Google Assistant on the Pixel, you’d be impressed and very pleased, I suspect. With Amazon’s Alexa Kayak “skill,” you can carry on a guided multi-step conversation around travel (e.g., rental car reservations). This is the kind of thing I was hoping to be able to do with Google Assistant: do a search and ask several follow-ups without interruption. Without consciously doing this, I found myself formulating queries and commands in a much more conversational style than with current voice search. I wanted to talk to Google Assistant much more like a human. It’s also something of a disappointment that so many voice queries are “answered” with web links. This won’t be a problem for most people (especially SEOs), but I wanted voice answers and more cards, rather than links to websites. I found myself disappointed when Google pushed links. While it will become more interactive over time, right now Google Assistant isn’t much different from the voice search/command experiences you’re already used to on Android phones. In the coming days and weeks, we’re going to see a bunch of “Google Assistant vs. Siri” articles. Generally, Google Assistant can do more and offers more functionality because of Google’s search index. Yet there are some things that Siri can do (right now) that Google Assistant cannot. Siri has some third-party integrations that Google Assistant doesn’t yet have. Those will come to Google Asssistant. For example, you can order Uber or Lyft using Siri right now, whereas you cannot with Google Assistant. Again, my criticisms of Google Assistant mostly come from high expectations and wanting it to do more and be less a speech-to-text voice search tool. One can start to see how Google Assistant over time will become a doorway or gateway (just like Google search on the web) for everything on Android phones. There are some dramatic implications for content discovery and SEO, which is what we’ve been talking about in the various articles and SMX sessions on voice search and content optimization. We’ll explore those more in the future. What’s fascinating here with Google Assistant on the Pixel (less so with Allo) is that you can really see the transition from more traditional “search” to a next-generation capability that is much more comprehensive, intuitive and interactive.

SUBSCRIBE Google’s HTTPS algorithm still only looks at the URL to give ranking boost Believe it or not, insecure web pages can still get the HTTPS ranking boost. Barry Schwartz on October 18, 2016 at 12:26 pm More In August 2014, Google launched their HTTPS ranking boost, where it would give sites that served up their pages on HTTPS a small ranking boost. But did you know that the only signal Google uses to determine if you should get that ranking boost is the first five characters of the URL, the “https” portion? Google does not look to ensure the certificate is valid or determine if the page has insecure content on the page or give you any of the typical browser warnings you’d get if the page is really not secure. Google will give the ranking boost solely based on the URL, starting with HTTPS. Gary Illyes, the Googler who wrote the HTTPS ranking boost signal, told us this in part two of our interview with him. He said the HTTPS signal,”basically looking at the first five characters in front of the URL, and if it’s HTTPS and it managed to get in the search results and it will get a minimal boost.” He added that they were thinking of adding “tons of things” but decided not to and focused more on site migrations and making sure sites were easily able to migrate to HTTPS, and Google was able to pick up on those changes. In fact, Illyes added that Google recently “deployed quite a few fixes for a site [that] moves to HTTPS.” He wouldn’t share what changes, but said it was based on some sites having issues with Google during the migration. Here is the audio file: Here is the transcript: Barry Schwartz: So what’s with HTTPS? Gary Illyes: What’s up with that? Barry Schwartz: Is that machine learning-based? Just kidding. Garry Illyes: No, it’s based on the first one, two, three, four… five characters. Barry Schwartz: And you haven’t change anything? You’re not looking at certificates, are they valid? Gary Illyes: It’s basically looking at the first five characters in front of the URL, and if it’s HTTPS and it managed to get in the search results and it will get a minimal boost. Barry Schwartz: But I thought you guys are going to add in factors like if it’s actually a real certificate… Gary Illyes: So we were thinking about adding tons of things. But eventually. I had lots of long discussions about this with ranking leads, and eventually, we decided that like the … ranking was just cool, the initial ranking boost. But if we are not showing the right URL in the results, then we have a different problem, basically. We either have a retrieval problem or an indexing problem, for like I don’t know, if an HTTPS URL shows up with mixed content, like active mixed content, like HTTPS scripts for example. Then that would be bad, but that would be an indexing issue, not a ranking issue. If we have a dupe cluster of which two URLs and two were the same URL, but one was HTTP and the other was HTTPS. And for whatever reason the HTTPS is not winning the dupe cluster is suddenly becoming canonical, and then we have an indexing problem. And the suggestion of the leads was that we should try to fix these problems and then make sure that site moves, like basically, when sites move to HTTPS that goes well and fix those cases and then like it should just work well, and that’s what we are focusing on. Recently, we had been deployed quite a few fixes for a site moves to HTTPS. … I know quite a few sites, for which moving HTTPS was like a breeze. It didn’t cause any issues; I think Yelp even posted a really nice article about this. Barry Schwartz: Wired commented that they had some issues, and they had to pull back and then go back and go forward. Gary Illyes: … Yeah, I was in touch with them. … It was interesting. Barry Schwartz: You want to tell us what those issues were, or [would] you rather not? Gary Illyes: I can’t, because it’s a third-party site. It isn’t not my site, so I will not talk about it. There were problems on both sides. You can learn more about the HTTPS ranking signal in our FAQ document. Note: This article was pre-written and scheduled to be published today.

The Google parent company unveiled the Pixel phone earlier this month, and tech reviewers just got their hands on the device. All reviewers note that the Pixel’s hardware design bears a striking resemblance to the iPhone. Just like the iPhone, it even comes in two sizes — one with a 5″ screen, and another with a 5.5″ display. Both the iPhone and Pixel also have great cameras. But that’s largely where the similarities end. Pixel comes with an ultra-fast version of Google’s Android operating system, completely free of “bloatware,” which refers to extra software that carriers often force onto the specialized Android versions their devices run. Bloatware tends to slow devices down significantly, and you won’t find any of it on the Pixel. Along with the snappiness of its operating system, the new Google Assistant feature is receiving rave reviews. Unlike Apple’s Siri assistant, which users frequently complain about or simply don’t use at all, Assistant appears to be incredibly useful. From Business Insider: Google Assistant pulls information from everything you do in Google’s services, from Search to Gmail to Calendar to Photos. The more Google services you use, the better Assistant becomes at helping you. … Assistant is smart enough to understand context across a variety of services to get you that one thing you want. It’s shocking and magical when it works, and it’s just the first step in Google’s ambition to create a personalized Google for everyone. Wired also had great things to say about Assistant: Assistant is the best voice assistant yet—though not as far ahead as advertised. Its lead is the difference between being surprised when Siri works and being surprised when Assistant doesn’t. Its speech-to-text recognition is almost perfect. Other differentiators include the inclusion of a VR headset for free when pre-ordering the device, as well as unlimited free photo and video storage with Google Photos. The Pixel arrives for users on Thursday, Oct. 20th. Its price starts at $650 for the “normal” sized model and $770 for the larger Pixel XL. Alphabet shares rose $19.93 (+2.47%) to $826.77 in Tuesday afternoon trading, earning new all-time highs in no small part due to the bevy of positive reviews for its new flagship device. Year-to-date, GOOGL has risen 6.11%.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.42pm EDT 13:42 What we'll be discussing Cities are home to more than half the world’s population and, as urban populations continue to rise, they must find ways to cope with acute demands for resources and space. In response, a growing number are embracing circular economy principles, from roads made out of waste plastic in Chennai, to bricks made from old construction waste in Rotterdam. Built-up urban areas also lend themselves to the expansion of peer-to-peer business models. In the US, for example, where 90% of households own a car, car sharing has been shown to help reduce traffic without taking away people’s freedom to drive. It also helps cut the cost of maintaining and parking cars. The question is how to go beyond individual examples of circular innovation to build a city-wide circular system. Join us onWednesday 19 October, 1-2pm (BST), to debate how to support the development of circular cities. Questions we will explore include: where are cities successfully embracing the circular economy and what resources aren’t yet being captured and repurposed? what is the role of business in developing circular cities? what’s next in the world of peer-to-peer lending? what incentives are there for urban dwellers to embrace the circular economy? what are the main barriers to developing circular cities?

Which phone will capture it best? MATTHIEU ALEXANDRE/AFP/Getty Images Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email This year, Google broke convention with its flagship phone by scrapping the old “Nexus” brand and calling it something new: Pixel. And while previous Nexus phones had decent cameras, Google says this Pixel has the best camera ever made on a smartphone. But Google isn’t the only phone maker hyper-focused on photography this year. Apple’s new iPhone 7 Plus included, for the first time, a dual-camera system with optical zoom and a game-changing portrait mode. So let’s compare the two cameras. I set out on a day-long photoshoot in California wine country, a scenic backdrop, perfect for pitting Pixel against the iPhone 7 Plus.* *Full disclosure: I’m not a professional photographer, but I am an Instagram addict. My phone is my primary lens and, like many other people, I care most about camera quality when upgrading my phone. Setting up the cameras Launching the camera on the iPhone is easy: Raise to wake (the screen automatically wakes up when lifted), then swipe left. To launch the Pixel’s camera from the lock screen, you have to press the camera icon in the bottom-right corner and drag up. In theory, it should take seconds, but because of the size of the Pixel XL (5.5 inches), I had issues getting it across the screen on the first try, which added a few seconds to the launch. The less obvious shortcut involves double clicking the power button --which is way more effective-- but I only discovered this after the shoot. The first thing you might notice in this comparison is that the crop on the iPhone is significantly smaller than the Pixel. That’s because the Pixel has a slightly wider-angle lens than the iPhone, which means shots look as if they were taken from farther away on Google’s phone despite having been taken from the exact same position. And while it looks like Google used editing apps in its Pixel sample photos, we decided to keep them RAW, so you can see what they look like before being tweaked. Auto HDR was left enabled (the default) and no other camera settings were changed (save for Portrait mode -- we’ll get to that later). The wider lens on the Pixel makes the shot appear farther away than on the iPhone. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET The first thing I noticed while shooting outdoors was how hard it was to see through the screen of the Pixel -- even with the maximum brightness, I had a hard time previewing my shot. This would likely only bother you when shooting in direct sunlight, but it seems like the iPhone has a brighter screen than its predecessors which keeps glare down to a minimum in direct sunlight. Odd, because when you look at them indoors, the shots appear brighter on the Pixel’s 2K AMOLED display. Anyways, onto the photo comparison. Take a look at the results for yourself, which one do you think won our shootout? Landscape Landscapes look great on both phones, but the Pixel appears to have the upper hand. The colors are slightly more saturated in this shot (appropriately so), the texture on the leaves is more identifiable and the background appears to be sharper. The iPhone’s shot looks slightly flatter (albeit more accurately-colored) and the background gets muddy sooner than the Pixel. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET The colors on the iPhone shot look muted compared to the Pixel with less texture on the leaves of the vines. Winner: Pixel. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET Action When you’re photographing sporting events, small children, or (in my case) animals, a fast shutter speed is crucial. I took the phones to the stables to see if they could keep up with the horses at the Napa Valley Horse Company. Getting the exact same shot on both phones while the horse was in motion proved nearly impossible, so the photos are different. In this scenario, neither phone had any perceptible shutter lag and both were able to capture the horse mid air within seconds of each other. The horse is sharp and in focus in both shots, which is impressive considering how fast it was galloping. As with the vineyard photo, the colors are slightly more saturated on the Pixel and the image is sharper with greater detail on the clouds both above the horizon and the sand below the horse’s hooves. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET You can really see the amount of detail in the Pixel’s shot if you look at the vineyards behind the corral. Overall the shot looks crisper with better contrast. Winner: Pixel. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET Close-up We hit the vineyards of the Jarvis Winery at the tail end of the harvest where there were still ripe grapes hanging on the vines, just waiting to be photographed. Neither phone has a dedicated macro feature so I used the automatic mode on both to see how they’d handle an extreme close-up of the grapes. And here’s where it got tricky: the white balance seemed to be different on each shot. The colors in the iPhone image appear cooler with deeper blues and in the Pixel’s image, the colors are warmer, with richer golds. The grapes appear to be brighter on the Pixel allowing you to see more detail, and darker on the iPhone creating a greater sense of depth in the shot. And for lack of a clear winner here I’m declaring this one a tie. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET The deeper hues on the iPhone create a greater sense of depth in the shot, while the golden tones of the Pixel bring out the details in the grapes. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET Food (and macro) For lunch we took a break from the horses and the vineyards for a quick culinary tour of the Oxbow Market in Napa. This shot made one thing clear: the minimum focus distance on the iPhone is significantly shorter than the Pixel. No matter how many times I tried to focus the Pixel on the pastry closest to me, it was only able to focus on the second and third tartlets. The iPhone didn’t have that problem. The pastry on the iPhone is brighter, giving the shot more depth (even though the background a hint over exposed.) The iPhone may be the better choice if you’re looking for tighter shots of your food (or anything else very close-up). Vanessa Hand Orellana / CNET After three attempts, the Pixel was unable to focus on the first fruit tart. The iPhone had no problem with this and made the shot appear to have more depth. Winner: iPhone. Vanessa Hand Orellana / CNET Portrait Next it was back to the vineyards for some portrait shots. Both phones have a feature that uses software to mimic the bokeh (blurred background) effect otherwise only achieved with a dSLR camera. On the Pixel it’s called Lens Blur. It’s buried under the settings icon in the top-left corner of the camera app. On the iPhone it’s actually called Portrait -- which was still in beta at the time of our shoot -- and it’s just a swipe away from the main camera interface. I’ve used Portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus and it’s really easy to use. The Pixel makes it a little more difficult. Once you hone in on your subject, you have to angle the phone up or down by following the arrow on the screen. Sounds simple, but the Pixel has a tough time distinguishing between the subject and the background. The end result rendered blurred-out limbs, leaving fly-aways (and everything else behind them) in focus. TL;DR: it’s not much better than using tilt-shift on Instagram. The images taken on this mode are also half the size of the standard shots which deteriorates the quality even more. The iPhone uses the telephoto lens for to create this effect, so you’ll likely have to step back to get the mode to work. You’ll know it’s ready when the “Depth Effect” flag appears on-screen. The iPhone was more effective at distinguishing between the the subject and background, thanks to that dual lens setup and though the edges still aren’t perfect, the overall quality of the portrait is significantly better than that of the Pixel. And this is an important win for the iPhone. Vanessa Hand Orellana / CNET No competition here. Because pictures taken with the “lens blur” effect on the Pixel are half the size of the regular photos, this picture taken on the Pixel has been stretched out to fit the dimensions. Winner: iPhone Vanessa Hand Orellana / CNET Selfies If you ever feel like flipping the shot on yourself, the Pixel may be the better choice with an 8 megapixel sensor compared to the iPhone’s 7 megapixels. Not only did the selfie look sharper, it was also wider-angle,letting me get more in the shot without having to over stretch my arm. (Win!) The same held true for low-lit selfies. Even though the iPhone has that “retina flash” (which illuminates the screen to light up your selfie), the selfie shot on the Pixel was sharper and better lit. The front camera on the Pixel out-performed the iPhone’s both outside and indoors. Winner: Pixel. Vanessa Hand Orellana / CNET Low light The wine cellars at the Jarvis Winery are burrowed inside a cave, the ultimate backdrop for a lowlight shootout. We mounted the phones on a tripod to get the exact same angle on both phones and reduce blur. Bot shots came out looking great, considering how dark the cellars were, but the Pixel was the clear winner. The camera was able to capture more light in the shot with greater contrast, creating a sense of depth more accurately resembling the real scene. Vanessa Hand Orellana / CNET Both phones were placed on a tripod for this shot to avoid blur. The Pixel’s photo is better lit and closer to what we saw in real life. Winner: Pixel. Vanessa Hand Orellana / CNET Flash So what happens when they get some help from the flash? The iPhone 7 Plus has a Quad LED true tone flash while the Pixel has a dual-LED dual tone flash which means -- if you believe the jargon -- the iPhone should have the upper hand. But the results speak for themselves. The model on the iPhone shot looks well-lit, but everything else is dark, and it’s clear it was taken with a flash. The light on the Pixel is more dispersed, making it look more natural and less flash-like. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET Had it not been for the hint of red in the model’s eye, it would’ve been hard to tell that the image shot on the Pixel was taken with a flash. The Pixel distributes the light evenly across the entire space while the iPhone only focuses on the subject. Winner: Pixel. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET The winner Let’s get one thing out of the way: both phones have -- you might say are -- impressive cameras. If you tend to shoot portraits and that’s what matters to you most, the iPhone 7 Plus is an obvious choice. Portrait mode is dSLR-esque in beta and we only expect it to improve by the time it gets a public release. But if brighter colors, sharper detail throughout the backgrounds of photos and capable low-light photography is more important, it’s the Pixel. I have to admit, I initially thought Google over-promised on its new flagship -- especially after those disappointing Nexus cameras -- but I was wrong. It’s a new chapter for Google phones and this one earned its name. This article originally appeared on CNET.com. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

Cons No waterproofing, expandable storage, or wireless charging. Bottom Line If you lust after the latest Android software and cool new features in the Google Pixel XL, but are turned off by large phones, the 5-inch Pixel is a superb alternative. By Ajay Kumar The unlocked Google Pixel ($649 for 32GB, $749 for 128GB) is almost identical to its larger sibling, the Pixel XL. The Pixel is a better phone for those who prefer the ergonomic advantages of a 5-inch design, while the 5.5-inch XL tickles the fancies of the phablet crowd. You lose some screen resolution by stepping down in size, but aside from that, the phones are virtually identical in terms of features and performance. Both have top-notch Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processors, the latest Android OS with guaranteed updates, 24/7 live help, and built-in Google Assistant capability. That makes the Pixel one of the best 5-inch Android phones available, and an Editors' Choice along with the Samsung Galaxy S7. //Compare Similar Products Compare Apple iPhone 7   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Samsung Galaxy S7   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Google Nexus 5X (Unlocked)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it LG V20   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Sony Xperia XZ   %displayPrice%%seller% see it ZTE Axon 7   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Huawei Honor 8   %displayPrice%%seller% see it LG G5   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Google Pixel XL   %displayPrice%%seller% see it OnePlus 3 (Unlocked)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Design, Display, and Features The Google Pixel takes many of its design cues from the Apple iPhone 7, including a metal unibody chassis, a bottom-firing speaker, and a rear camera that sits in the upper-right corner. We received the Quite Black Pixel model for review, which is more like a very dark gray, but still looks sleek. It's also available in Really Blue and Very Silver. The Pixel is one of the more reasonably sized Android phones you can get. It measures 5.7 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 5 ounces. The Galaxy S7 is nearly identical, at 5.6 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, but slightly heavier at 5.4 ounces. The 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is smaller and lighter than both at 5.4 by 2.6 by 0.3 inches and 4.9 ounces. Like the larger XL, the back of the Pixel has a pane of glass inlaid in the upper half, with a fingerprint sensor set in the middle. It's a unique design that prevents the Pixel from looking like every other phone out there. With Pixel Imprint you can register up to five fingerprints to unlock the phone, though it seems to take ever-so-slightly longer to wake and unlock compared with the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7. Motion gestures let you swipe down on the fingerprint scanner to access the notifications shade, which is convenient. View All 10 Photos in Gallery You'll find a USB-C charging port on the bottom with a speaker and mic on either side. The Power button and volume rocker are on the right, a SIM card slot is on the left, and a 3.5mm headphone jack is up top. You won't find a microSD card slot, so you're limited to internal storage, as with the iPhone. The phone also lacks waterproofing and wireless charging. If any or all of these features are important to you, your needs will be better met by the Galaxy S7. The Pixel has a 5-inch, 1,920-by-1,080 AMOLED display. It's very bright, and at 441 pixels per inch (ppi) text is crisp and clear. It doesn't quite match the S7's 5.1-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED panel (577ppi), but it's sharper than the iPhone 7's Retina display (326ppi). Colors look accurate, viewing angles are terrific, and using the phone under direct sunlight is no problem. That said, the larger Pixel XL boasts a Quad HD panel with 534ppi, and for the price, it's somewhat disappointing to see the drop in resolution here. Left to right: Google Pixel, Apple iPhone 7 Network Performance and Connectivity We received a Verizon model of the Pixel for review, but it's unlocked and supports bands for use on all US carriers. You have a wide array of GSM (850/900/1800/1900), CDMA (800/1900), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/25/26/28/29/30/41) for solid performance on any service provider. We tested the phone on Verizon, the winner of our Fastest Mobile Networks award for the third year in a row. In Midtown Manhattan the phone delivered strong network performance, with a top download speed of 41Mbps. It also supports dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, and Bluetooth 4.2. Voice calls are good, with clear transmissions through the earpiece and solid noise cancellation for outgoing calls. There's a minor robotic edge to voices, but it doesn't impact overall clarity. Earpiece volume could stand to be a bit louder. Processor, Battery, and Camera Like its larger sibling, the Pixel is powered by a top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor. On Geekbench, which tests CPU performance, it received a single-core score of 1,524 and a multicore score of 4,127, roughly the same as the Pixel XL (1,661/4,136). Those results are similar to those of the Snapdragon 820–powered Galaxy S7 (1,695/3,955), likely because Geekbench hasn't been optimized for the Snapdragon 821 yet. Neither phone is a match for Apple's A10 Fusion-powered iPhone 7, however, which scored 3,490/5,662. The JetStream browser benchmark, which shows how the phone handles advanced Web applications, provides a better picture of the improvement you can expect. The Pixel scored 55.227, significantly higher than the S7's 41.201. The Pixel has 4GB of RAM, which is more than ample for multitasking and gaming. I was able to play graphically demanding games like GTA: San Andreas and Asphalt 8 without any trouble. And unlike the Pixel XL, the Pixel never ran physically warm in testing. See How We Test Cell Phones Battery life is solid. The phone clocked 7 hours and 21 minutes of runtime in our test, in which we set screen brightness to maximum and stream full-screen video over LTE. That's actually better than the larger Pixel XL (6 hours, 43 minutes), likely thanks to the Pixel's lower-resolution display, and roughly 2 hours longer than the iPhone 7 (5 hours, 45 minutes). But the Galaxy S7 bests them all with 9 hours. That said, the Pixel XL showed seriously strong standby time, lasting an entire weekend with power to spare; I suspect the Pixel will be about as good. It also supports fast charging with the included adapter, charging to full in roughly an hour. Camera Camera performance on the Pixel is identical to the XL. Both have a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with laser autofocus. We tested the Pixel against the iPhone 7 Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S7, two of the best smartphone cameras available. All shots were taken with Auto mode and no other adjustments. Overall camera performance is excellent. In well-lit situations, such as our shots of the Flatiron Building and a flower bed above, the Pixel captures clear, detailed images, favoring brighter colors a bit more than the S7 and matching the iPhone 7 Plus in overall clarity and detail capture. In lower light it also does well, beating out the S7 in capturing details in areas with shadows or darkness, as our shot of a statue below illustrates. The Pixel's rear camera is capable of recording 4K video at 30fps and 1080p at 60fps. In both cases, video is smooth and stable, assisted by the excellent electronic image stabilization (EIS). We tested the EIS by walking the length of a hallway in PCMag's office with the Pixel, and then compared the results against those of the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, both of which use optical image stabilization (OIS). The Pixel has excellent stabilization for a device that uses software-based rather than physical lens adjustments, but naturally, the S7 and iPhone 7 were more stable when it came to panning around. The Pixel tends to jitter and lose focus during turns. The 8-megapixel front-facing camera takes good, clear shots in most circumstances. It also allows for solid video chats via Duo. Software, Google Assistant, and 24/7 Help The Pixel ships with Android 7.1 Nougat, a version of the operating system that is not yet available on any other phone. It brings some significant changes, including an app screen that's been removed from the home screen and can only be accessed by swiping up, and some less significant ones, like circular app icons. And Google promises to deliver software updates to the phone, which is a heck of a lot better than you can expect with many other Android devices. The Pixel is a marked departure from Nexus phones like the 6P and 5X. It's the first phone with Google Assistant built in, which is essentially the company's version of Siri. You can call it up by holding down the Home button or by simply saying "OK Google," and use voice commands to carry out various tasks such as receiving weather updates, making phone calls, and adding events to your calendar. Replies aren't perfect, though, and certain queries will just return a Google search result. It uses machine learning, so we expect it will get better over time, especially when it integrates with Google Home. Non-Pixel users can still access Google Assistant through Allo, but having it built in is definitely a plus. The other big selling point of the Pixel is 24/7 live support. Accessed through the Support tab in the Settings menu, it allows you to text with or request a phone call from a Google support representative. We tested this service twice, before launch and a week after. Text chat works best in terms of accessibility. We were quickly connected with a support representative after a brief wait. Support quality varied from person to person, but all were eager to assist and one even followed up by email and offered a return merchandise authorization to make sure our issue was resolved. Phone support is available 24/7, but our experience here wasn't as smooth. Wait times in getting a call back are longer, and two attempts made to contact phone support over the weekend seemed to go unanswered, though a representative did follow up later by email. Still, the live support Google offers with the Pixel is significantly better than anything you'll get from nearly any other phone manufacturer. It's next in line behind Apple's Genius Bar, which you definitely can't access from your own home. The phone has an unlockable bootloader (except for the Verizon retail model), which means you can root the phone and install ROMs. In terms of the software load, you'll find the standard set of Google apps, along with three bloatware apps—My Verizon, Message+, and go90—which can thankfully be uninstalled. (If you buy the Pixel directly from Google you won't have these preloaded.) You're left with 25.11GB of available storage out of a total of 32GB. That's on the low side, but you get free unlimited storage for photos and video with Google Photos, which helps. Still, given the absence of a microSD card, we advise you pay the extra $100 for the 128GB version, which brings your total up to $749. Conclusions Overall, the Google Pixel is one of a handful of reasonably sized Android phones that, because of its hardware, can compete with flagship phablets. That makes sense, because at $649-$749, it's priced right in line with those high-end models. If software is of paramount importance to you, no other Android phone on the market can match the Pixel. If you're more interested in hardware, the Samsung Galaxy S7 is the phone to get. It has a higher resolution display, a waterproof design, expandable storage, and longer battery life. Both phones fulfill different needs, and are equally worthy of our Editors' Choice. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

Cons No waterproofing, expandable storage, or wireless charging Bottom Line The Pixel XL has top-notch hardware, the latest Android software, and guaranteed support from Google, making it one of the best big-screen Android phones you can buy. By Ajay Kumar The Google Pixel XL is a phone with promise. It promises the latest version of Android with guaranteed updates. It promises 24/7 customer support. It promises support for Daydream VR. And it promises a voice assistant to rival Apple's Siri with built-in Google Assistant functionality. Add top-tier hardware to the mix, and you get a winner. Google still needs to deliver on some promises in order to have a five-star product on its hands, but in its current state, the Pixel XL is still one of the best phablets you can buy. It's stands right up there with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the LG V20 as an Editors' Choice. //Compare Similar Products Compare Apple iPhone 7 Plus   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge   %displayPrice%%seller% see it LG V20   %displayPrice%%seller% see it ZTE Axon 7   %displayPrice%%seller% see it OnePlus 3 (Unlocked)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Google Nexus 6P (Unlocked)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Motorola Moto Z Force Droid   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Google Pixel   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Design, Features, and Display You'd be forgiven for mistaking the Pixel XL for an Apple iPhone 7 Plus at first glance, but a number of differences become apparent close up. It has an attractive metal body, distinct antenna lines, and a camera that sits flush on the back. The back has a panel of glass covering the top half, which adds visual interest. We received the Very Silver version of the XL for review, but it's also available in Really Blue and Quite Black. The XL is about the same size as most other new phablets. It measures 6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 5.9 ounces, slightly slimmer and lighter than the iPhone 7 Plus (6.2 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches, 6.6 ounces). You can't use either phone one-handed, so if you want a big screen combined with a (relatively) compact build, your only option is the Galaxy S7 Edge (5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces). Or you might want to check out the smaller Pixel, which is essentially the same exact device as the Pixel XL, but with a smaller 5-inch 1080p display. The Power button is on the right side of the phone, and a volume rocker is right below it. The Power button also launches the camera with a double press. The left side has a SIM card slot. Unlike the S7 Edge and many other Android phones, the Pixel XL lacks a microSD card slot, so you can't expand storage beyond what you get out of the box. The bottom has a USB-C charging port with a speaker and mic on either side. The speaker gets loud, but it's not match for the thunderous front-facing pair on the ZTE Axon 7. On the top you get a 3.5mm audio jack, something you won't find on the latest iPhone. But the Pixel XL lacks waterproofing and wireless charging, two features you'll find in the S7 Edge. View All 12 Photos in Gallery A circular fingerprint scanner sits on the back, and lets you register five fingerprints with Pixel Imprint. The scanner is fast and responsive, though both the 7 Plus and S7 Edge are a bit quicker in waking and unlocking the screen. On the other hand, the Pixel XL's sensor has some extra functionality thanks to motion gestures, letting you do things like swipe down on the scanner itself to show the notification shade. The front of the Pixel XL is dominated by a bright and well-calibrated 5.5-inch 2,560-by-1,440 AMOLED display that offers terrific viewing angles. The screen works out to a crisp 534 pixels per inch (ppi), making it markedly sharper than the Retina display on the iPhone 7 Plus (401ppi) and on par with the screen on the S7 Edge (534ppi). Visibility outdoors is not problem, and while the Pixel's AMOLED panel isn't quite a match for Samsung's in terms of color saturation, it still benefits from true black reproduction by lighting pixels only as necessary. A built-in Night Light feature can automatically change the color temperature of the screen at night to make it easier on your eyes. Left to right: Google Pixel XL, iPhone 7 Plus Network Performance and Connectivity Our Pixel XL review unit is the one sold through Verizon, but it's technically unlocked and has no branding on its body. It supports GSM (850/900/1800/1900), CDMA (800/1900), HSDPA (850/1700(AWS)/1900/2100), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/25/26/28/29/30/41). That means you can use it on every major carrier in the US. We tested it on Verizon, the winner of our most recent Fastest Mobile Network tests, and saw strong network connectivity. We recorded a top download speed of 40Mbps, very good for a highly congested area. In the less-crowded Jersey City, it registered an even more impressive 64Mbps down. The XL also supports Bluetooth 4.2, dual-band Wi-Fi, and NFC. Call quality is a good. Transmissions are clear, with a mild robotic tone that doesn't impact overall clarity. Noise cancellation is strong, but earpiece volume is on the low side. Processor and Battery The Pixel XL is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor clocked at 2.15GHz. It's a more powerful chipset than the Snapdragon 820 you'll find in most high-end Android phones, though most current benchmarks aren't yet optimized to illustrate the difference. In Geekbench, the Pixel XL scored 1,661 single-core and 4,156 multicore, which isn't much different than the Galaxy S7 (1,695/3,955). Both phones were bested by Apple's blazing A10 Fusion processor in the iPhone 7 Plus (3,463/5,612). JetStream benchmarks, which show how the phone handles advanced Web applications, provide a clearer picture. The Pixel XL scored 53.719, higher than the S7 (41.201). The XL has 4GB of RAM, which is on par with most other flagship Android phones. Multitasking is fast and smooth and games like GTA: San Andreas and Asphalt 8 are playable without any dropped frames or latency. The phone does seem to run warmer than others we've tested (including the 5-inch Pixel), with noticeable heat radiating from the glass panel on the back, but it has no impact on performance. See How We Test Cell Phones Battery life on the XL is good, but not spectacular. In our battery rundown test, in which we stream full-screen video over LTE with screen brightness at maximum, the Pixel XL clocked 6 hours and 43 minutes. That's longer than the iPhone 7 Plus (6 hours), but shorter than the stellar 10 hours the S7 Edge managed in the same test. Standby time, however, is fantastic. We charged the phone to full capacity on a Friday night, used it over the weekend without plugging it in, and when Monday rolled around it still had 37 percent left. Fast charging is supported with the included adapter, which lets you charge the phone to 35 percent in 30 minutes, and fully in 1 hour and 30 minutes. There's also a battery saver mode that tamps down screen brightness and restricts background apps to save power. Camera The Pixel's XL's 12.3-megapixel rear-facing camera compares surprisingly favorably with two of the best phone cameras on the market, those on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, despite a lack of optical image stabilization (OIS). Outdoors the XL is a stellar shooter that captures clear, detailed pictures with very little noise or blur. Colors are actually a bit brighter than on the S7, as you can see below. Low-light shooting is also very good, minimizing grain and surpassing the S7 in dimmer settings. The iPhone 7 Plus, on the other hand, does a bit better in low light, favoring denser greens. The set of shots of the Flatiron Building above shows similar performance between the three phones. They all produce clear and detailed pictures, but the XL edges out the S7 in shadow detail, and the iPhone 7 Plus looks just a hair better than the XL. As for zoom, there's no real comparison. With its 2x telephoto zoom lens, the iPhone 7 Plus takes significantly better close-up pictures than the XL and the S7 do with digital zoom. Video can be recorded in 4K at up to 30 frames per second. While the XL may not have OIS, which reduces jittering through the physical adjustment of the camera lens, it does have some of the best electronic image stabilization (EIS) we've tested, which uses software. Walking down a lengthy hallway in the PCMag office while recording, the stabilization on the XL came close to matching that of the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Video recording is smooth when taking a single long shot, but when panning the camera around or turning, there are some artifacts and jerkiness. The front is home to an 8-megapixel camera. It takes clear, reliable selfies, and works well for video chatting in Duo. Software, Google Assistant, and 24/7 Help Along with the Pixel, the Pixel XL is the first phone to ship running Android 7.1 Nougat. The differences become clear as soon as you boot up the phone and look at the home screen, which is markedly different from that of any other Android phone on the market. In some ways it feels like iOS, including the lack of an app drawer. Instead, you swipe up from the bottom to access all your apps. App icons are redesigned to be circular. And the Pixel is first phone with Google Assistant (the company's answer to Siri) built in. It can be accessed a long press of the home button or simply by saying "OK Google." Google Assistant allows for a wide range of tasks including making subscriptions to news or weather updates, adding events to your calendar, playing music, launching apps, sending texts, answering general questions, making phone calls, and navigating with Google Maps. It's not perfect, though. More specific queries will often simply return a generic search result. But since the service is based on machine learning, there's plenty of potential for results to get better over time and future integration with Google Home to look forward to. While you can use Google Assistant on other Android phones through Allo, 24/7 live support is a feature exclusive to the Pixel. We tested this service twice, once right before launch and again a week after. Live chat support via text is accessible and easy to use. The moment we clicked on the Chat button under the Support panel we were told our place in line and connected to a representative within a few minutes. As with most support services, the knowledge and helpfulness of individual representatives can vary. One representative wasn't familiar with a well-known camera lens flare issue, and advised us to factory reset the phone; he also offered a return merchandise authorization and followed up a day later by email. Support via voice is available 24/7, but you're likely to experience a much longer wait time before you get in touch with a representative. In our case, two attempts at contacting phone support over the weekend initially went unanswered, though we did get a follow-up by email a few days later asking if we still wanted a phone call. Still, the live support Google provides for the Pixel XL is far better than you'll get from just about any other phone manufacturer. It's rivaled only by Apple's Genius Bar, but then again, you can't access the Genius Bar from the comfort of your home. In terms of preinstalled apps, the Pixel XL is a pure Google experience. You get Google Launcher, Google Assistant, Google Now, and a full suite of Google apps including Allo, Duo, Google Photos, and many others. For those who buy their phones through Verizon, you'll find three apps preloaded: My Verizon, Message+ , and go90. All three can be uninstalled. Overall, on the 32GB model, you're left with 24.43GB. You get unlimited Google Photo cloud storage photos and videos, but considering the lack of a microSD card slot, most users will want to opt for the 128GB model, which brings your price up to $869. The Pixel's XL bootloader is unlocked, except for the Verizon retail model. That means rooting and installing ROMs is possible; that should allay some fears about Google turning the Pixel into a closed realm. Conclusions At $769 (or $869 if you go with the 128GB model, which you should), the Google Pixel XL is priced to compete with the highest-end phones on the market. And in most regards, it's a success. The Pixel XL represents a combination of powerful hardware, excellent software with the promise of updates, and extensive customer service support. In theory, it's exactly the phone Google needs to compete with Apple. But until Google Assistant or Daydream VR becomes a must-have feature, we can't quite give the Pixel XL a full five stars. Some people will prefer the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge for its waterproof design, expandable storage, wireless charging, and longer battery life. Others will want the LG V20 for its removable battery, "secondary" display, and unrivaled audio performance. But we highly recommend the Pixel XL to any Android user who wants the guarantee of updates and the peace of mind that comes with Google's promised support. That makes it an Editors' Choice.

That You Don't What Savvy Online Shoppers Know... That You Don't Nancy Mitchell Oct 18, 2016 Budget Living Tips & Techniques Home Share Pin Email Share Pin Email Max & Emily Settle Down in the Heart of Boston (Image credit: Emily Billings) It would be a bit of an understatement to say that the internet has revolutionized shopping. You can now, from your couch, buy pretty much anything you can imagine, and have it delivered to your home in a matter of days. But the internet hasn't just made shopping faster or more convenient — it's also made it smarter. Here are six time and money-saving strategies that all savvy online shoppers know. 1. Always comparison shop. If, like me, you have a particularly thrifty mother, you may have memories of her combing through circulars from different grocery stores, trying to find the best price on milk or eggs or what have you. With the internet, you can do that with pretty much anything. Before you buy, do a quick Google search on the name of the product to see if another store is offering it for less or use Google's official shopping tool, Google Shopping or another comparison website like Price Grabber. 2. Be smart about shipping. The purchase price of an item isn't everything — there's also shipping and taxes (which, in the States, apply if the retailer in question has a physical location in your state). Do the math and factor it in before you buy! And if the site where you're shopping offers free shipping over a certain purchase amount, check to see if you're close: If shipping is $10 but you're $3 away from the free shipping threshold, add a small sale item to your cart instead. 3. Know your return policies. Sites like Gilt may seem like a good deal, but they often have incredibly inflexible return policies (such as exchanges or store credit only) or charge restocking fees. That great deal may not be such a great deal after all if you wind up stuck with something you don't really like — so read the return policy carefully before you buy. 4. Always look for coupons. Couponing in the virtual world is a lot simpler than the paper version. Finding discounts is as easy as typing "J Crew coupon" into Google right before you check out, and if even that's too much, there are plenty of browser extensions out there, like Honey and Coupons at Checkout, that will automatically search for and apply deals as you shop. Few things are more satisfying than saving twenty dollars in thirty seconds. → Notes from a Moderate Couponer: Easy, Non-Extreme Ways to Save Money Using Coupons 5. Try eBay! This is a smart shopping tip I've been using for years: If there's a brand you particularly love, or even a single pricey item you covet, try searching for it on eBay. You can often find deep discounts on gently used items, or styles from last season, or even brand-new merchandise. (Be sure to check the seller's feedback to make sure you're getting the real deal.) 6. Get an app to tell you when things go on sale. Shoptagr is a Chrome extension that will let you know when your favorite items go on sale. It will also tell you when things are low in stock, so you don't have to worry about your favorite things selling out while you wait for a sale. What are your favorite online shopping strategies?

I struggle with this, because the answer often starts, “It depends.” Unless you ask about a phone. In that case, I usually say get an iPhone. Don’t get me wrong. I love Android. But the phones can be … frustrating. Clever features too often seem overwrought or poorly designed, or they’re buried beneath 15 Verizon apps on the homescreen. The iPhone is the Default Phone, the one you buy when you want a phone, not a project. The Google Pixel changes that. It offers the look and competence of an iPhone, with a truly great camera and loads of innovative software and services. It changes my answer to the question I hear most often: What phone should you get? You should get a Pixel. Talk To Me Google’s new phone arrives Thursday, starting at $650 for the Pixel and $770 for the Pixel XL. You can get it in blue, black, or silver, with 32 or 128 gigs of storage, from Google or from Verizon. You should buy it directly from Google, and soon. Most models already are backordered. Not long after I got my Pixel XL, I flew to Colombia for a week’s vacation. It was a very Google-y getaway: I had a Project Fi SIM card, I kept my itinerary in Google Trips, and, given what Verizon charges for international data on my iPhone 7, I relied entirely upon the Pixel because Project Fi gives standard rates in most countries. The trip provided a perfect way of testing the limits of Google Assistant, Pixel’s distinguishing feature. If the Pixel is Google’s iPhone, Assistant is its souped-up Siri. Long-press the on-screen home button or say “OK Google” and ask it anything. How many dollars is 290,000 Colombian pesos? How hot is it in the Tatacoa desert? Where can I find coffee? Assistant was my guide, translator, and researcher. It knew where I needed to go, how to get there, and when to leave. It told me about Simón Bolívar, and knew enough about current events to explain the recent protests in the plaza that bears his name. Assistant does share common stumbling blocks with Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. It likes to answer easy questions by showing web results, and it speaks at unexpected, often jarring moments. “HERE ARE YOUR EVENTS!” is not a useful thing to yell when asked about my calendar. I wish I could type questions into the pop-up prompt instead of saying everything aloud like a tourist or opening an app like a nerd. In theory, Google’s deep knowledge of you and your life sets Assistant apart, but that didn’t always pan out. Assistant has all the information needed to handle me saying, “Wake me up 30 minutes before I need to leave for the airport,” but it failed to do so. On a later attempt, it set the alarm for almost seven hours before my flight. There’s traffic in Bogotá, but not that much traffic. Still, Assistant is the best voice assistant yet—though not as far ahead as advertised. Its lead is the difference between being surprised when Siri works and being surprised when Assistant doesn’t. Its speech-to-text recognition is almost perfect, even when I butchered Villa de Leyva. I don’t open as many apps anymore. I tell Google to do stuff for me. The biggest challenge to enjoying Assistant has been my own inertia. Assistant makes everything faster and easier, if you remember to use it. Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: KELSEY MCCLELLAN FOR WIRED The Best Camera You Have With You I spent one night in the Tatacoa desert, at a small hotel miles from the nearest town. Returning to civilization, our taxi driver Hermes took us on a tour of photo-friendly spots. He’d lead us down some tiny side road, point to a big rock or cool crevice, and with two hands gesture for me to hand him my phone so he could take a picture. I also took hundreds of 12-megapixel photos and 4K videos, and more selfies than I’m proud of using the 8-megapixel front cam. (For the record, I didn’t bring the selfie stick. I just used it.) In every case, the colors, dynamic range, and sharpness matched or exceeded every phone I’ve used. You don’t get the cool zoom or soft-focus features of the iPhone 7 Plus, but you get killer photos nonetheless. Everything automatically goes into Google Photos, where the Pixel gets you unlimited free storage for full-resolution video and stills. In fact, the real difference between the Pixel and the iPhone’s camera is a matter of approach as much as of execution. The iPhone faithfully reproduces the exact light of the image, even when it’s boring or flat or dark. The Pixel, like most Android phones, subtly enhances everything to make it a little brighter, a little more vibrant. You can watch the automatic HDR processing in real time, if you open a photo right after shooting. Most of the time, the Pixel takes a nicer photo than you’d expect. Some photographers prefer to make those creative decisions. But I like that my photos look awesome on Instagram, no filters necessary. I’ve never been more confident shooting with my smartphone. The Highest Form of Flattery Yes, the Pixel looks like an iPhone, and that’s totally OK. My review unit is the 5.5-inch Pixel XL: a teensy bit smaller in my hand than the iPhone 7 Plus, but so similar that I confuse the two. The beveled aluminum body is a little sharper and harder than the round, smooth iPhone, but feels solid and nice to hold. The Pixel’s only standout hardware features are the large, round, rear fingerprint reader and the glass panel that takes up about a third of the back. I’m of two minds about the fingerprint reader placement: I love how easy it is to turn the phone on and unlock it with my index finger while sliding it out of my pants, but it’s annoying to have to pick it up every time unless I want to manually enter the passcode. The glass panel feels sort of pointless (It is, at least functionally, I’m told.). It’s different for different’s sake. I prefer the iPhone’s unified, monolithic feel. You know what sucks about the Pixel? It’s not waterproof. Every phone should be waterproof. Beyond that, my hardware complaints are nitpicky. I think it’s dumb to only have one speaker, and the headphone jack should be on the bottom edge. But none of this matters to most people. Specs-wise, it’s exactly what a phone this expensive should be, and as fast as you’d expect. It’s the first Daydream-ready phone, prepared to handle Google’s new VR platform, but I haven’t tested that yet. I suspect it’ll look better on the Pixel XL’s 5.5-inch, 2560×1440 display rather than the Pixel’s 5-inch, 1080p screen, though. The battery on the Pixel XL always survived a day of travel mapping, menu translating, and election news searching with 20 to 30 percent left when I went to bed. I haven’t tried the Pixel, but I suspect that its lower-res screen means it should last about as long despite having a smaller battery. Otherwise, the two devices are identical. Google clearly wanted to make something high-end yet widely appealing. It isn’t going after someone who loves a good stylus, or who wants funky design touches or niche productivity features. It’s just a really, really good smartphone. Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: WIRED Grown-up Android The Pixel continues the tradition, established by Google’s discontinued Nexus line, of being the only way to enjoy the best of Android. (In fact, it’s even more extreme than that: Assistant is exclusive to the Pixel for the foreseeable future.) It’s a shame, because the Pixel addresses almost all of the annoying little things about Android. For example, until now, app icons were different sizes, which is a great litmus test for whether you’re a little OCD. (Guilty.) On the Pixel, they’re uniform, and most of them are round. It feels carefully considered in a way Android rarely does. An unobtrusive icon that leads you into the Google Now stream replaces the giant Google search bar. You can swipe up from the bottom of the homescreen to access apps, instead of tapping the four-dot button some people never even discover. The software even uses App Shortcuts, which are basically like 3D Touch for Android—hardly any apps use it so far, but I hope that changes. I’ve always loved Android because it felt so much more alive and connected than iOS. The sharing menus are smarter and more prominent, apps refresh in the background so they’re always up to date, and widgets and notifications are useful and interactive. But iOS was always so much simpler, with shallower learning curves. It’s dictatorial, but painless. The Pixel’s software doesn’t totally close that gap. It’s still too easy to clutter your homescreens with multiple versions of the same icon, and it’s still too hard to find cool features like the thing where you can swipe down on the fingerprint reader to see your notification shade. But the Pixel is the most coherent and cohesive Android ever. I’ve always been an iPhone guy, honestly. I’ve used just about every flagship Android phone ever made and always returned to Apple. That’s partly because I bought an iPhone 4S in 2011 and signed up for iMessage, and leaving iMessage is a monumental pain in the ass. But mostly I liked having a phone I didn’t have to think about. The iPhone always offers great hardware, a good camera, fantastic apps, and data security. I don’t want to worry about my phone, or spend my time tinkering with it. My phone’s too important to risk any extra effort, or worse, unreliability. But I’m switching. For real. I’m turning off iMessage, re-buying apps, and warning friends that I probably won’t get their texts for a few days. I am a little worried about Google’s long-term commitment to this new hardware push (and the customer support that comes with it), given its propensity for killing products that don’t get billions of users. But I’m totally in love with the Pixel. I love this camera, I love Google Assistant, I love that I’ll get to use it with a comfy VR headset, I love that I finally get a version of Android that is both powerful and attractive. I love that there’s a kickass Android phone that (probably) doesn’t explode. The immediate joke everyone, including me, made on Twitter after the Pixel launch was that Google made an iPhone. Well, that’s true. As it turns out, an iPhone running Android is exactly what I’ve been waiting for.

Next: All PayPal accounts were 1 click away from hijacking by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Remember back in 2013, when Ticketmaster – the world’s largest online ticket retailer – decided to stop torturing people’s eyeballs by making them decipher blobs of melted characters in order to prove that they’re human? Likewise, Google’s now too stabbing a fork into CAPTCHA, the aggravating test that’s supposed to determine if we’re robots or scripts used by spammers or other online misdeed-doers, or if we are instead real, live, warm-blooded simians. CAPTCHA came out of Carnegie Mellon University and stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”. The tests are designed to be hard for robots, easy for humans. They typically consist of typing letters and/or digits from a distorted image. Or, as the case may be, messages to go pleasure yourself. Or, then again, mathematical problems that make your brain bleed. Ten years into using CAPTCHA to keep robots from engaging in dirty tricks online, the “supposed to weed out bots” has now turned into “utterly stink at weeding out bots”. That’s because advances in Artificial Intelligence have resulted in robot creations that are now able to solve even the most difficult variant of distorted text with 99.8% accuracy, according to Google’s recent research. Not that Google’s going to stop testing site visitors to weed out bots, mind you. Rather, as it announced on Wednesday, Google’s going to move away from asking users to read blobby text and type it into a box, as it’s been doing, like this:  And instead will simply ask us, “Are you a robot?” with what it’s calling the “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA” API, like so: Asking us to check off a box saying that “I am not a robot” will be an effective way of determining whether or not we’re robots because humans move their cursors in a humanlike way. Specifically, the difference between bot and human can be revealed in clues as subtle as how a user (or a bot) moves a mouse in the brief moments before clicking the “I am not a robot” button, according to Vinay Shet, the product manager for Google’s Captcha team. Without realizing it, humans also drop clues that can establish whether we’re automated or not: IP addresses and cookies show our movements elsewhere on the Web and can help prove that we’re not a bad actor. Wired quotes Shet: All of this gives us a model of how a human behaves It's a whole bag of cues that make this hard to spoof for a bot. He said that there are other variables that will help make the determination, but those have to be kept secret, lest botmasters figure out how to work around them and once again learn how to slip past Google’s filters. Google’s been integrating automated bot-detection into its CAPTCHAs since at least 2013. In October 2013, Google revealed that it had developed what it called its Advanced Risk Analysis backend for reCAPTCHA to filter out bots. The backend doesn’t just look at whatever gobbledygook we type into the box. Rather, it observes our entire engagement with a CAPTCHA, from start to finish – before, during, and after we type into the box – to determine whether we’re carbon-based. On Valentine’s Day, Google gave us a taste of what reCAPTCHA can do, presenting us with chocolates and flowers and throbbing hearts – the first two of which were rendered in text that was simple (for humans) to read. It sounds great, but it’s not yet time to kiss the inscrutably distorted CAPTCHA blobs goodbye. Over the past week, Google’s tests on sites that use CAPTCHA have verified most humans, but it still missed quite a few. As Wired reports, about 60% of WordPress users and 80% of users at video game sales site Humble Bundle got past the CAPTCHA with only the simple checkbox. When Google’s Advanced Risk Analysis engine can’t figure out what we are with a mere click, it’s going to back up the test with a pop-up window that will present users with the same old distorted text we’ve been enduring for years. For mobile users, things haven’t gotten quite so simple as a single click. But when they face a CAPTCHA on their mobile phone or tablet, they’ll now have a much easier hurdle to leap: rather than having to type in text, they’ll be asked to select all the images that correspond with a clue image. Like Google says, it’s a lot easier to tap photos of cats or turkeys than to type in a line of text on a phone: And if you’re worried about the privacy implications of Google analyzing where your mouse moves on a page, Shet pointed out that Google will only be tracking your movements over the CAPTCHA widget when it appears on other sites, not on the entire page. This is how he put it to Wired: You don’t have to verify your identity to verify your humanity. Besides, as we’ve noted before, tracking movement is not just a Google thing. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail or any webpage can track everything you do and could be keylogging your every pointer movement or keystroke. Logging keystrokes is no super secret, privacy-sucking vampire sauce. It’s plain old Web 1.0. This is not news, but it’s certainly worth repeating: anybody with a website can capture what you type, as you type it, if they want to. The reality is that JavaScript, the language that makes this kind of monitoring possible, is both powerful and ubiquitous. It’s a fully featured programming language that can be embedded in web pages, and all browsers support it. It’s been around almost since the beginning of the web, and the web would be hurting without it, given the things it makes happen. Among the many features of the language are the abilities to track the position of your cursor, track your keystrokes and call “home” without refreshing the page or making any kind of visual display. Those aren’t intrinsically bad things. In fact, they’re enormously useful. Without those sort of capabilities sites like Facebook and Gmail would be almost unusable, searches wouldn’t auto-suggest and Google Docs wouldn’t save our bacon in the background. In the case of Google’s advances with reCAPTCHA, such an ability can stop a lot of bad bots from doing things that can be worse than the annoyance of having to endure typing in text from a blobby image. Think bots that harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook pages, site scrapers that grab the content of websites and re-use it without permission on automatically generated doorway pages, bots that take part in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and more. I’ll take the kittens, please!

In the era where the mouse is becoming obsolete Google are going to rely on user mouse movements or clicks to define whether a person is human or not. There are some pretty big gaming communities that have been scripting human like mouse behavior for years. It’ll be interesting to see how this progresses.

Reply Paul Ducklin says: September 9, 2016 at 5:40 pm I thought a hamburger was called “a hamburger” in the US :-) By definition, of course, even in British English, a hamburger *is* a sandwich. At any rate, there seems to be no suggestion in any of the Oxford lexicons (British or American) that sandwiches can’t be circular. Two pieces of bread with an edible filling in between is all you need to pass the test. I guess the CAPTCHA folks were hoping a robot wouldn’t be able to handle the subtleties… Having said that, if you tried to order a hamburger by asking for “a sandwich” in Maccas, I think you would get, errrrrrrr, either a sandwich, served in the form of a square cut into two triangle, or a word from the security guard (depending on how strongly you argued the case, and whether it was after 1am).

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (194) Post your comment Weekly poll: What is the best smartphone of 2016? 18 October 2016 This time of year, there are only two things for a phone geek to do - wonder which was the best phone of the year and wonder what theyll announce at CES early next year. Lets focus on the first part, were sure the rumors for CES/MWC will start pouring in pretty soon. So, which phone deserves the title Best smartphone of 2016? To make the number of choices more manageable, weve split the question into two - phones (under 5.5) and phablets (anything 5.5 and bigger). They often come in pairs - Phone and Phone Plus - anyway, but there are a few exclusively big devices. How did Samsung do? It listened to consumer feedback from the S6 and the Galaxy S7 is downright impressive. Water resistant, long battery life, always on screen, perfected camera, expandable storage. Sure, the battery is still sealed, but thats the norm now, not the exception. What about its chief rival, the Apple iPhone 7. Its water resistant too (a first for Apple), it finally got OIS (after being skipped over in the 6s generation), the company even bumped the storage options to a minimum of 32GB and a middle step of 128GB. Okay, it took away the headphone jack in favor of an improved taptic engine for the non-clickable Home button (love it or hate it, this will improve durability). Google killed off the Nexus to fight the iPhone directly. The Google Pixel has big aspirations (and a price to match) and is packed to the rafters with Google tech, including the new Assistant. Still, the Pixel drew ire from Nexus fans - at this cost people expected at least some stereo speakers, water resistance, OIS, smaller bezels, no oddly-positioned glass pane on the back. LG was ahead of the curve with the dual-camera setup on the V10 and later on the LG G5. It also tried to push a modular design (Google also believed this was the future), added Always on functionality to the main screen (not the secondary screen like the V-series). And hey, we can count the number of phones with a removable battery on this list on one finger. Huawei is pushing harder into the West, for the Huawei P9 it roped in photography legend Leica to tune and brand the dual cameras. Instead of the wide-angle lens of the G5, the P9 opted for artistic Black & White shots with the second camera (which also has the practical benefit getting more light in the dark). It cant shoot 2160p video, though, a strange omission for a camera-centric phone. HTC builds the Pixel phones for Google, but it still hopes people will pick its own HTC 10 over them. The phone shows off HTCs metal body know-how and features Optical Image Stabilization on both the back camera and the selfie camera. And it has dual-speakers, another thing people wish the Pixel had. After swearing off the two flagships a year strategy, Sony went and released a flagship to surpass the Xperia X Performance. The Sony Xperia XZ brings back 5.2 screen and 2160p video capture from the Z5 and it refreshes the still new X-series design. Another late-comer is the Xiaomi Mi 5s - a mid-season upgrade of the Mi 5. Its one of the most affordable phones with Snapdragon 821, a 12MP camera with a large sensor, a new all-metal body and a solid battery. Go ahead, cast your votes. Over the weekend we will do a recap and ask the very same question about bigger phones.

(Reuters/Ricardo Moraes) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Getting There October 18, 2016 Travelers are afraid of commitment. On average, would-be voyagers search for a flight 48 times before booking, according to Expedia, the largest online travel agency in the US. Even in the era of low fares throughout the airplane, finding the best one is certainly a reasonable, if time-consuming, goal. Google, which launched its travel app, Google Trips last month, is trying to cut down on the frequent searches with a new feature that taps into one of the great motivators of travel: the fear of missing out. Google Flights, its flight-search tool, now provides travelers alerts for when the fare is expected to rise, which could be a matter of hours. It is also giving travelers tips to get a lower fare, such as flying on other days, or to and from other airports. (Courtesy Google) It’s the latest attempt by the travel industry to nudge consumers into buying something. Rival booking site Kayak has a similar tool which tells travelers the chance of an increase in their itinerary if they don’t book. Expedia two years ago launched a tool called Scratchpad, which saves previous searches, to shorten the booking process (and cut down on the chances of search exhaustion). Travelers who use that function are three more times more likely to complete their booking on Expedia’s site than those who started over, a spokeswoman said. These tools could provide a helpful push toward booking that flight so you can quickly get back to fretting about seeing your family. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Yet it's still one of the best out there. Google achieves that by pulling together the best features from Apple, Samsung and other phone makers and offering them at prices comparable to iPhones — starting at about $650 for the regular, 5-inch model and $770 for the 5.5-inch "XL" edition. Both versions go on sale Thursday through Verizon, Best Buy and Google's online store. I tested the Pixel XL model; the regular version has identical features except for its smaller display and battery — still enough for 13 hours of internet use, according to Google. With either, you get an excellent camera and a strong voice assistant that promises to get smarter — all without the bloat common with other Android phones. This Sunday, Oct. 16, 2016, photo taken with Google's Pixel XL smartphone shows a reservoir at New York's Central Park. With Pixel's camera, image quality is superb, though photo purists may quibble. Colors look strong and clean, as though they¿ve been processed with software. (AP Photo/Anick Jesdanun) The Pixel isn't quite an iPhone replacement, as Google wants you to believe ; hardware is just part of what makes an iPhone an iPhone. But it might serve up a strong challenge to Samsung, especially as people look for alternatives to the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 . ___ THE CAMERA The Pixel's image quality is superb — though purists may quibble. Colors in some shots look too strong and clean to me, thanks to software processing intended to reduce distortion and improve detail (something all phones do to some extent). But automation pays off in another way: The Pixel will automatically combine successive shots into an animated "GIF" file, offering a fun way to share a toddler's steps or a dog jumping. For video, the Pixel's stabilization technology compensates for shaky hands and other movement, matching what the iPhone and Galaxy phones can do. The Pixel borrows a quick-launch feature from Samsung phones. Just double tap the power button to start the camera, even if the phone is locked. To switch between the front and rear cameras, just double twist the phone like a door knob — a feature Motorola, which Google once owned, has long offered. Low-light images taken with the Pixel in three museums aren't as crisp as those from the iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7 (which has the same camera as the Note 7). But differences are small, and the Pixel does better than typical smartphones. Where the Pixel falls short is in extreme close-ups, such as shooting a flower petal or a small bug; photos were typically blurry. The Pixel's selfie camera is also inferior, with no front flash or control over the focus. But it's fine in good light and at typical distances for selfies. ___ THE ASSISTANT Google's voice assistant, simply known as Google Assistant, will seem familiar to those who have used Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa features. Google's version goes further in offering daily updates such as weather and news, though plenty of apps already offer similar capabilities through notifications. Google is also better at remembering preferences — say, if you prefer temperatures in Celsius — and at integrating with its own services, such as Translate and Photos. But Assistant doesn't yet sync with a similar Assistant in Google's Allo chat app and upcoming Home speaker. And it isn't as proactive as the Google Now assistant already built into Android phones. Google Now, for instance, will look through your Gmail account for flight reservations and remind you when to head to the airport. It will analyze your daily commute and warn of delays. Assistant waits for you to ask. Assistant holds up well compared with Siri and Alexa, but for more, swipe from left to right to get the old Google Now back. Google says Assistant will eventually get the Google Now functionality. ___ OTHER FEATURES If you need help, you can reach Google's customer support and enable screen sharing reminiscent of Amazon's Mayday help feature. And the Pixel will work with Google's upcoming Daydream View virtual-reality headset, much as Samsung phones have Samsung's Gear VR. Long-pressing an app icon brings up a menu of shortcuts, such as getting directions to home or launching the selfie camera. It's similar to the iPhone's 3D Touch. The Pixel also offers "Night Light," a feature that tints your screen amber by filtering out blue light that might keep you up at night. Apple calls it Night Shift. Pixel owners get unlimited storage of photos at original resolution, though that's a little like offering Google search for free. Google Photos already offers unlimited storage at up to 16 megapixels; the Pixel's camera is 12 megapixels. The free offer will make a difference for those who take video in ultra-sharp "4k" resolution, but the default setting is lower, at 1080p, which is already free at Google Photos. ___ WHAT'S MISSING The Pixel will be OK if you spray it with water, but don't drop it in the pool. You also can't expand its storage with a memory card, as you can with the S7 and Note 7 — though for $100 more, the Pixel's 32 gigabytes of storage quadruples to 128 gigabytes, and the free online storage should take care of your photos and videos. The battery isn't removable, though that's true for most phones these days. Those looking for a Note 7 replacement will find the Pixel missing a stylus. If you're an iPhone user, you'll have to brace yourself for the switch to Android, which would entail buying new apps and learning new ways to navigate. ___ MAKING THE SWITCH Google tries to make it easy to switch. The phone comes with a transfer cable, and the set-up process walks you through transferring photos, music and video, as long as it's not encrypted (so scratch iTunes video). But apps won't switch over from iPhones; you need to buy them again.

However, one question remains, which accessories should you get for your new toy once it arrives? Here is a list of some of the best options which include charging docks, cables, screen protectors, and more. Cases If you want to go the official route, Google has their own line of “Live Cases” for the Pixel. There are a wide variety of designs to choose from, some of which can be customized by you. Use your own photos of stylized maps. The cases also have a built-in shortcut button. Purchase from Google Explore More Pixel and Pixel XL Cases Best Cables & Chargers Everyone knows that the biggest accessory for a new device is making sure you have enough cables to keep your device charged as much as possible. It’s terrible when you have a charging port open, but don’t have the right cable with you since the Pixel and Pixel XL use USB Type-C, so here are a few options for you. Cables Finding compatible USB Type-C cables can be a pain. You don’t want to purchase the wrong one and end up with a fracked device that won’t charge. Thankfully, since USB Type-C has been used in more devices since the introduction of the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, there are quite a few options on the market. Here are some of the best ones that we could scrounge up for everyone. Google’s USB Type-C Cable – $25 iOrange-E USB Type-C to Type-C Cable – $13.99 BlackSquid USB Type-C Cable – $12.95 Anker PowerLine USB Type-C to Type-C Cable – $12.99 Tronsmart USB Type-C Cable – $6.99 Chargers It’s cool that Google bundles a charger with the Pixel and Pixel XL, but that means that you only have one charger and that’s just not enough. There are a few other options on the market that will allow you to use as a “travel charger” or maybe you want to have a desktop charger that won’t fry your sexy new smartphone. Lastly, we know that you’ll be needing a car charger Google’s USB Type-C Charger 18W – $35 SONEic USB Type-C Charger 15W – $17.99 Belkin USB Type-C Car Charger 15W – $34.99 iVoler 75W USB Type-C Desktop Charger – $36.99 Anker PowerPort+ USB Type-C Desktop Charger – $39.99 Adapters Since the Pixel may be your first USB Type-C device, you may be wondering what you’re supposed to do with all of the microUSB cables that you have accrued over the years. Well, luckily there are a few “Benson-approved” adapters that you can use while charging or transferring your information to and from your fancy new devices. Google’s USB Type-C to USB Standard-A Adapter – $12.99 Anker USB Type-C to Micro USB Adapter (2-pack) – $7.99 iOrange-E USB Type-C to Micro USB Adapter – $9.49 Otium USB Type-C to Micro USB Adapter – $6.99 JOTO USB Type-C to Micro USB Adapter – $7.99 Docks Speaking of transferring information to and from your Pixel and Pixel XL, you may want to be able to have a spot on your desk for your new toy and there are a couple options for you. Encased Desktop Charging Dock – $24.89 NXET USB Type-C Charging Dock – $22.99 Screen Protectors It’s still early before everyone else will be able to get the Pixel or Pixel XL, but there are still a few options on the market to make sure your screen is protected from scratches or drops. Keep in mind that the Pixel and Pixel XL both feature rounded displays, so the screen protector won’t go “edge-to-edge” but here are some great options to keep you protected. Verizon Tempered Glass Screen Protector – $24.99 SuperShieldz Tempered Glass Screen Protector – $7.99 PLESON Tempered Glass Screen Protector – $7.85 Skins Dbrand Dbrand is the leader in terms of robots taking over the company’s Twitter account, as well as providing some of the best skins on the market. The company has already started accepting orders for Pixel and Pixel XL skins which will also include the “G” logo which Google opted for this year. However, if you want some nostalgia, dbrand is also offering the option for the iconic “X” cutout that was present on previous Nexus devices (*sobs*). Skins start at just $9.99 and you can go for full coverage, just get the back covered, and can even get a colored logo cutout. Purchase from Dbrand SlickWraps SlickWraps is working its way to being just as well known as Dbrand, especially if you look at the Twitter battles that have taken place over the last year or so. These skins are a bit more pricy than those of its main competitor with skins starting around $15, but there are MANY more options. SlickWraps is including its numerous different series of skins with the Pixel and even are offering an option to have the “G” logo colored which is pretty nifty. Purchase from Slickwraps Car Mounts Keeping your eyes on the road and off your smartphone is of upmost importance, but sometimes we need to be able to see the next move in Google Maps. That’s where car mounts come in handy, and there are more than enough options on the market for you to pick from. But here’s our list of top options for you to choose from for your new Pixel or Pixel XL. iOttie Easy One Touch Mini Car Mount – $19.95 Belkin Car Vent Mount – $14.53 Kenu AirFrame – $18.95 Newward Long Arm Car Mount – $15.99 Spigen Magnetic Vent Mount – $7.99 Beyond the Norm Sometimes there are some extra accessories that will perfectly with a new device, and since the Pixel and Pixel XL weren’t the only new items introduced by Google, here are some other options to get the whole ensemble. Daydream View The Pixel and Pixel XL are the first Daydream-ready smarthphones to be released and along with it, there is a new Virtual Reality headset that was introduced. The Daydream View is only $79 and offers a much more immersive VR experience than the old Google Cardboard. Plus, it includes a new touchpad remote which allows you to control various aspects of what you are viewing without worrying about fumbling with the headset itself. Purchase from Google Chromecast Streaming content directly from your smartphone and onto your TV is something that has really picked up steam over the last few years. With Google offering “Cast” support across all Android devices, there’s no better way to do it, and with the new Chromecast Ultra, things get even better. The ability to stream 4K Ultra HD content is amazing and you can set your Chromecast up to showcase your favorite photos as a “screen saver” for your TV. However, if $69 is too much for your taste, Google is still offering the regular Chromecast for just $35 and if you just want some better audio controls instead of using Bluetooth, the Chromecast Audio is available for $35. Purchase from Google Google Home Google is planning for Home to be the new “thing”, as it looks to overtake Amazon’s Echo lineup of devices. Google Home hopes to be the best option for keeping your home “connected” and being as useful as possible with the help of Google Assistant. What better time to outfit your home to be smart than to get the Google Home along with your Google Pixel? The Home is priced at just $129, which is $50 cheaper than the Amazon Echo and includes the best assistant on the market. Purchase from Google Will you be getting one? If you’ve been waiting to pull the trigger on snagging the Pixel or Pixel XL, the day has come for you to make your decision. Will you be getting one, or will hold out a little bit longer? Sound off in the comments below and let us know what you’re planning to do, and if you need some help in your decision-making prowess, be sure to check out Phandroid’s coverage of the Pixel and Pixel XL with the links below.

Last week, after Google announced its two new phones, VR goggles, an always-on speaker-receiver combo to compete with Amazon's Echo, a new Wi-Fi routing system, and a new version of their Chromecast streaming service that supports 4K video, Traveler explored how this new hardware would only further the search engine's swift rise as a major power player in the travel world. This week, the Googleverse continues that rise, with an announcement that Google Flights—the brand's flight search engine—will soon begin notifying fliers as to when airfares will expire. Share via facebook dialog Share via Pinterest Previously, Google Flights allowed users to see an airline’s fluctuating prices and a calendar of fares, and would also alert users of price drops or spikes. With this new feature, to be rolled out in "the coming weeks," the app will now notify you as to when that fare you're seeing will expire, so you'll know how much you stand to lose if you don't, say, book that one-way, $292 ticket to Amsterdam within eight hours. Though rival apps like Hopper and Hitlist also notify fliers of low fares and send price alerts, neither tell curious purchasers whether or not the ticket price they're seeing will be the same several hours from now, and whether that person has time to mull it over. (Neither do Kayak or Skyscanner.) The feature isn't infallible, of course, but Google's wealth of historical flight data at least helps to get us one step closer to the age-old question: When is the best time to buy airline tickets? Other notable upgrades: If you are tracking a destination instead of looking for a specific route, Google Flights will display tips on picking the best route—think recommended airports, cheaper dates, or tentative price increases. One level below that stage of planning, the app's integrated "Explore" tab lets users put in their month, region, and number of travelers, and will then spit out suggested destinations. Looking for a winter escape, and have your eye on the Caribbean for one week in December? Aruba is nonstop for $275, and Punta Cana rings in at $417. Google has also recently launched Google Trips, a mobile travel guide, and will soon add more features to its "hotel search" function. Stay tuned...

Over the Obama administration’s eight years, the technology industry has embedded itself in Washington. The president hung out with Facebook Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg and hired the government’s first chief tech officer. At least at the lower levels of officialdom, the revolving door with companies such as Google is spinning ever faster -- as it once did with Wall Street. Politicians have played down their connections to finance since the taxpayer bailout of 2008. No such stigma attaches to tech, for now. But as the Valley steps up its lobbying efforts, with a wish-list that ranges from immigration to rules for driverless cars, some critics warn that similar traps lie in wait: It’s not easy for the government to police an industry from which it poaches talent and solicits help with writing laws. “If you’re trying to influence government policy on behalf of a corporate sector, it’s not better that you do it for the tech industry than for Goldman,” said Jeff Hauser from the Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington. Hauser heads the Revolving Door Project, which scrutinizes political appointees. Even amid mounting concern over inequality, he says wealthy tech executives and their companies are still considered cool. In other words: It may be hard to persuade people these days that what’s good for Goldman Sachs is good for America -- but it might just work for Google. The five biggest U.S. tech companies are now the five biggest companies, period -- at least as measured by market value. And they’re flexing that financial muscle. The tech firms spent $49 million on Washington lobbyists last year, while the five largest banks shelled out $19.7 million, data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics shows. On the personnel front, the Campaign for Accountability, a non-profit group, studied the to-and-fro between government and Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc. It found that 183 people who worked under President Barack Obama through last year were hired by Google, while 58 headed the other way. Google is in Washington to “help policy makers understand our business and the work we do to keep the internet open and fuel economic growth,” the Mountain View, California-based company said by e-mail in response to questions. Facebook’s goals in the capital include protecting customers, “explaining how our service works, and maintaining an open Internet and a culture of innovation,” it said in an e-mail. There have been other high-profile moves out of Washington: former Attorney General Eric Holder this year took a job at Airbnb Inc., and David Plouffe, Obama’s one-time campaign manager, started at Uber Technologies Inc. in 2014. Persistent rumors have linked Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg with the post of Treasury secretary in a Hillary Clinton administration. Sandberg, a former chief of staff at the Treasury under Larry Summers, told a conference this month that she plans to stay at Facebook. Apple Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Microsoft Corp.’s founder Bill Gates were on a list of Clinton’s potential vice-presidential nominees, according to an e-mail allegedly from her campaign chair that was released by Wikileaks. The administration’s view is that tech people are welcome in Washington because they can help make things work better -- and help is certainly needed. Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary, says the government is shifting toward using technology the way business has been doing for years. It has set up a coding boot-camp for employees, while data scientists work across federal agencies to mine the archives and help improve transportation projects. ‘Data as Currency’ “We view data as currency,” Pritzker said in an interview. She travels to Silicon Valley at least once a quarter and has an advisory council of 21 tech experts. Megan Smith, the former Google manager who took a job as Obama’s chief technology officer in 2014, says the long-term goal is to make government services as smooth a user experience as that offered by, say, Amazon or Dropbox. Collaboration with tech companies pre-dates Obama’s creation of a special post to oversee it. Zillow Group Inc., the real-estate website, helped the Treasury after the housing-market collapse, according to Stan Humphries, its chief analytics officer. “I was struck by how little data the government had” in areas such as price indexes or foreclosures, Humphries said. The Seattle-based firm filled the gap, offering its micro-data to Federal Reserve researchers and even, on occasion, to Neel Kashkari, then an assistant secretary at the Treasury department and now in charge of the Minneapolis Fed. “They were soon sucking up every bit of data that we had available,” said Humphries. Biggest Fear In Washington, favors typically come at a price though. Tech giants, which are in the habit of buying up smaller companies and also trying to tie customers to their own platforms, keep a close watch on antitrust policy. In 2013, Google -- like Microsoft before it -- was threatened with a potentially costly legal battle. Federal Trade Commission staff said the company “unlawfully maintained its monopoly” over internet searches, though the 20-month probe was eventually closed. “ Competition policy, that’s the thing they’re most scared of,” said Barry Lynn, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, a Washington think-tank. “If a Microsoft-style case was brought against any of these companies, it could totally change their business prospects. It could result in radical changes to the scale and structure of their corporations.” Cases have been opened in Europe against Google and Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, said Lynn. He’s a Republican, showing that concern about the growing power of the tech giants isn’t confined to the political left. Not that the left doesn’t share it. Clinton has talked about tougher antitrust laws aimed at ending the “abuse of economic power” by corporations. ‘Their Damn Computers’ She’s also taken aim at their shifting of profits overseas to avoid taxes. Hauser, who worked at the Justice Department’s antitrust division before joining the Revolving Door Project, said tech firms “are at the leading edge of tax avoidance because of the ways they’ve perfected moving their intellectual property overseas.” He said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew’s support for Apple, after the iPhone-maker was ordered to pay back-taxes in Europe, is an unprecedented stance for a Democratic administration. Clinton’s Republican rival Donald Trump proposed a tax cut for companies that repatriate profits, though it didn’t win him many converts in the tech industry. Then there’s the labor market. Trump has taken aim at Apple among other companies that have shifted jobs overseas. “We’re going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country,” he said in January. But the iPhone-maker announced this month it’s setting up a second R&D center in China. Big tech simply doesn’t hire on the same scale as its heavy-industry predecessors. And technology is reshaping the workforce in other ways too, with Silicon Valley favorites like Uber and Taskrabbit Inc. at the forefront. They’re central to the growth of a gig economy that’s spurred calls for rules on health-care and employment insurance to be updated. Tech companies also typically back immigration rights for skilled labor that have become politically toxic, and they support trade accords that both presidential candidates oppose. They’ve clashed with the government over the balance between internet privacy and national security, notably when Apple boss Cook refused to help unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. Beyond the shopping-list of specifics, says Lynn, the industry has one overarching desire: light-touch regulation. “They want to be left alone,” he said. “They want to be allowed to do what they want to do.” And to keep Washington at arm’s length, it helps to get close to it first.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The Google Pixel reviews are up, and, for the most part, critics are raving about Google’s new smartphones, the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL. While you may have heard it’s a Verizon exclusive, that’s not necessarily true. In fact, you can buy it elsewhere and still use it on Verizon or other carriers. Or, and you may not have known this, you can buy it from Verizon and use it on any other major U.S. wireless carrier. Google Pixel from Google This is your best bet if you want to get the phone right from the source or are a Project Fi user and want a Google Pixel with a Project Fi SIM card in the box. Expect to wait a few weeks for most models, though, since many have been in and out of stock since pre-orders opened earlier this month. Google Pixel from Verizon The good news here is that Verizon promises to deliver updates to the Google Pixel as fast as Google will. We’ll believe it when we see it, but if you trust those claims, Verizon is another great place to buy the phone. It still has some stock available and offers the option to pay full price for it. You need to pick some sort of data plan online, which is a pain, but you should be able to cancel it after you get the Pixel. Also, Verizon’s Pixel and Pixel XL are carrier unlocked, so you can take them over to AT&T, T-Mobile or Sprint. Google Pixel from Best Buy I recommend this option last. Best Buy had iPhone preorders and wasn’t able to deliver them on time, so I’ve lost a bit of trust in giving them my money ahead of a major product release. Also, it’s only selling phones through Verizon. It also only has 32GB models in stock, which means you can’t get the 128GB option there… at least not yet. Those are your best choices now. The Google Pixel officially releases on October 20. Good luck.

Refered to as a “snapshot of what’s coming up,” any tracking updates from Gmail will also show up here. While similar to Google Assistant’s ability to detail your itinerary for the day, the tab does not include any new cards. Meanwhile, other cards like weather and sports still remain on the main feed represented by a newspaper icon. The addition of tabs is likely a better way to let users sift through the information they receive on a daily basis through Google. Compared to the version A/B tested in August, the tabs are much narrower and the text naming the tabs have been removed. Instead, on first receiving the feature, users are shown a tutorial that focusses user’s attention on the new tab. The feature is still rolling out to those on the latest version of the Google app beta. However, not all users on version 6.7 have received it yet. Recent updates to the Google app have renamed Google Now to the Feed and added a new widget that shows notifications right on the homescreen under the search bar.

Google to launch new app comparing cheapest flight prices from Liverpool Liverpool Echo 18/10/2016 Jonathan Yates A new service from Google looks ready to rival leading flight comparison sites when it launches in the coming weeks. Google Flights is the latest innovative feature from the company and could transform the way travellers from Liverpool John Lennon Airport (LJLA) book holidays in the future. The search engine giants new feature will tell you when the price of a flight is expected to rise, plus it allows you to track flights and set up alerts of when prices fluctuate. The handy tool will compare flight prices on the date you are looking to book with any historic prices to let you know whether it is likely to decrease or increase and helping you save money. This week is the best time to book train travel from Liverpool Lime Street for Christmas The app is being launched in the run up to Christmas in the hopes to make travel planning less stressful for consumers. The company are also aiming to make travel planning and booking on phones much more accessible in general. Find out more below on how the app works and how to use it to the best of your advantage. How does the app work? Notifications on price increases © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Once selecting a flight of your choice a notification may appear telling you in how many hours the fare is likely to increase. For example it may state "£71 fare increase likely in 8 hours" ensuring that your current booking is the ideal time to purchase your flight. Flight fare price comparison tool Similar to Skyscanner and Kayak the app will show you the cheapest flight for the route you are looking to book. So if you can be flexible with your travel dates - say if you're booking months in advance - then this tool will be handy. The app will also give you tips on any expected price jumps using historic prices for that route, as well as when and how much the price is likely to increase. It will also recommend alternate airports, so it may be cheaper to fly to a European city from Manchester rather than LJLA. Tracking your flight If you don't want to book straight away you can choose to track your flight or route, receiving notifications to your email letting you know when fares are expected to change - whether that's an increase or decrease. You can now book Easyjet flights for May half term 2017 Explore © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc If you're looking for somewhere new to travel then the app can help with that too. It will give you destinations based off the type of holiday you want. Then you can search for hotel in that area for example 'hotels in Berlin' and the app will label hotels when the price is lower than usual, or if there is discounted rates to the normal rate for those travel dates. You can filter to the likes of 'Deals', 'Cheap' or 'Top Rated'. Google announced that the app will be availble to download on smart phones in the coming weeks. © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Go to MSN Home More in News Briton will be extradited to US over hacking charges Sky News Farage: Marine Le Pen has done a good job Huffington Post UK Trial hears Jo Cox was murdered 'by gunman repeating "Britain First"' The Guardian Mosul: Snipers, car bombs and trapped families Sky News Nazi memorabilia on offer at school car boot sale The Guardian Hero dog saves boy stuck in tumbler Press Association Up Next MiG-29 fighter jet crashes into sea Sky News More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices More from Liverpool Echo The Mystery Island hosts evening with ECW legend Shane Douglas Liverpool Echo Mersey Ferries service to remain suspended until sea trial carried out Liverpool Echo Parents of 11 week old baby who died in hospital during E.coli outbreak demand apology Liverpool Echo Liverpool Echo More from Liverpool Echo Home News Weather Entertainment Sport Money Lifestyle Horoscopes Health & Fitness Food & Drink Cars Travel Dating © 2016 Microsoft Privacy & Cookies Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Anti-Spam Newsletter

Reviewers who spent time trying out and scrutinizing the new mobile devices ahead of everyone else are now speaking on what it’s like to use Google’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus competitors. Are they giving good feedback  to the handsets, or is it the opposite? Let’s find out.  BuzzFeed’s Nicole Nguyen gives credit to Google for ensuring that the Pixel comes with a powerful software, but she couldn’t say the same for the appearance of the device. The news reporter even calls the look of the Pixel “uninspired.” Nguyen claims that nothing is spectacular about the phone’s hardware save for the fact that it screams of Google’s desire to prove that it can go head-to-head with the big players, Apple and Samsung.  Gizmodo’s Michael Nunez calls the Pixel phone “too dumb and ugly” to be even considered as a replacement for Apple’s iPhone. He adds that Google may have come up with big ideas for its new smartphone, but it still falls short of its goal of producing an “iPhone-killer.” The reviewer’s tirade does not end there as Nunez also points out that Google’s AI is still “too stupid” at this point that Google Assistant sounds too mediocre when compared to Siri. Nunez adds that the user experience of the AI feature is “underwhelming” because it failed in performing commands correctly on more than one occasion.  Engadget’s Chris Velazco has also noticed some cons when it comes to both the Pixel and the Pixel XL. The tech reviewer says that the phones are expensive despite not having commendable designs. Velazco also opines that being less water-resistant than it rivals from big companies is also another con. ZDNet’s Jason Cipriani questions Google’s “best ever” claim for its smartphone cameras present on both the Pixel and the Pixel XL. According to him, the smartphone snapper does have zero shutter lag, but it is clearly not the best phone camera there is. Pointing out the primary camera’s flaws, Cipriani says that the photos it captures are “a little too saturated.” Hence, the reviewer maintains that the claim is not really true, but he also admits that the Pixel devices’ camera is actually the best one yet for Google’s smartphone releases.   Contrary to the aforesaid opinions, there are also tech reviews that emphasize the good things about the Pixel handsets. For example, VentureBeat’s Emil Protalinski and Jordan Novet agree that the Pixel XL is apparently “the best Android phone money can buy.” Comparing the new Google handsets to last year’s Nexus smartphones, the reviewers note that the Pixel mobile handsets are “more powerful” despite being smaller in size.  Related Stories Google Pixel XL vs. LG V20 — Which Is Better? Pixel XL Not Better Than iPhone 7 Plus, Says Report Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs. Google Pixel XL — Which Is The Better Phablet? CNET’s Lynn La gives her two cents on the Pixel and Pixel XL, saying that the camera of the two is “fantastic” even in low light conditions. La also commends Google for bringing Google Assistant to the Pixel devices since for her, this is the “most natural, human approaches” to AI so far.  Mashable Asia’s Raymond Wong states that with Google’s new smartphones, everything phone consumers want for a flagship device to have is present. Wong says that the Pixel XL is not lacking when talking about phone specs. He also reveals that based on his experience, daily performance is fast and smooth without lags even when multitasking.  Wired’s Kelsey McClellan stresses that Google’s Pixel has changed the idea that the iPhone is the default standard among smartphones, for it is just as competent as Apple’s iPhone with the addition of “innovative software and services.”  Wrapping up her review piece, the Wired reporter bravely says the Pixel is the product of when Google comes up with its own iPhone.  Finally, Business Insider’s Steve Kovach also has good things to say about Google’s smartphones. He opines the Pixel is not only an excellent device, it is also what Android should have been from the very start.

For those switching from an iPhone to a new Pixel phone, it’s easier than ever to take all your contacts, messages, calendar appointments and media with you. iPhone to Pixel transfer: How to connect As part of the retail packaging’s included items, Google added a small USB Type-C to Type-A adapter, meaning you can plug the USB end of your iPhone Lightning cable in to one side, and plug the Pixel in to the other. Before you do that though, you need to start the Pixel phone setup process, which initially looks just like any other Android phone setup. Google Pixel tips and tricks: Getting to grips with Google's phone Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Which should you choose? iPhone to Pixel transfer: Getting started The first step of the setup process is inserting your SIM card. This goes in the SIM tray on the left edge of the device. There’s a small, round SIM ejector tool in the packaging, inside the white envelope which also contains all your usual warranty and getting started guides. Once you’ve inserted the SIM, the next step is choose to copy data from another device. After that, you connect to a Wi-Fi network. iPhone to Pixel transfer: How to transfer After you’ve connected to a network and inserted the SIM card, your Pixel phone will prompt you to connect your iPhone and Pixel to each other using the aforementioned adapter and Lightning cable. It’s worth remembering that your iPhone has a built-in security system which won’t let you transfer data to another device, unless you indicate that you trust the other device. That means you need to unlock your iPhone and choose “Trust” on the pop-up message that appears on your screen. Once you do tell your iPhone to trust the Pixel phone, your Pixel will start gathering all the information it needs to perform the transfer. Essentially, it searches the iPhone for any data it can copy across. This process takes a few minutes. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: When and where can I get them? Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Galaxy S7 edge: Which should you choose? iPhone to Pixel transfer: What can you copy? When the search is complete, you get a list of all the data you can transfer. You can choose which elements you want to copy across and which ones you don’t. You can choose from the following Calendar: Including iOS calendar entries Contacts Email (Gmail syncs automatically) Message attachments Messages Music (anything stored on the device) Photos and Videos (anything stored on the device) It’s worth remembering that with so many cloud-based services like Google Photos, and music subscription services like Spotify, Google Play Music and Apple Music available on both platforms, some of these options are redundant. If you know you have those backed up already, you can choose not to copy them over. However, if you don’t use any cloud-based alternatives and do have all your media stored on your actual iPhone’s built-in storage, it can copy them all across to your new Pixel. Once you’ve chosen everything you want to copy, hit “next”, and the data starts making its way across. Thankfully, the Pixel can do all of this in the background as you continue the regular Android setup process, including adding your fingerprint and security preferences (Pattern/PIN unlock etc.) and setting up Google Assistant. iPhone to Pixel transfer: Does it work? For the most part, the feature works flawlessly, but there are a few caveats worth noting which can’t be worked around. While Google can move your calendar appointments and events across in to your Google Calendar app, it can’t stay synced with your iCloud calendar. So, if you share a calendar with another iCloud user, no new events, reminders or appointments will show up. Only the ones already in place will copy across, and they get synced to your Google calendar account. As a way around this, you could download a third party email/calendar app and sign in using your iCloud details. Outlook for Android includes support for iCloud, and can handle both email and calendar in one application. Likewise, all of your conversations from Messages app (including iMessage conversations) copy across in to the Android Messenger app. That doesn’t mean, however, that Android has suddenly gained the ability to send iMessages. It just stores all your conversations as SMS threads. When you reply, or continue the conversation, it does so using standard SMS text messages.  We found some music tracks didn’t copy across, while some did. This could be down to the tracks being copyright protected. Regardless of those minor issues, we love the simplicity and peace of mind that comes from knowing we’ve kept all of our conversations and contacts despite moving to a new smartphone platform.

Follow TechnoBuffalo We published our Google Pixel review earlier this morning and, in it, we chat about how good the camera on the Google Pixel is. Spoiler: it’s pretty darn great. I took the Google Pixel out with me to a dog park and apple picking this weekend, where I had the chance to test the camera outdoors with plenty of sunlight. This is, typically, where a camera tends to shine. It’s also where you can see flaws, if a camera isn’t able to pick up a blue sky in the background, for example. The Pixel did really well here, and I was particularly impressed by some of the macro shots I picked up. In lower light, the Pixel leaves a little bit to be desired, but overall it fared well.

Fact Check joins existing labels in Google News, such as In-Depth, Opinion, Wikipedia, Local Source, Highly Cited, and others. Publishers who have done the due diligence of fact-checking their articles are eligible to receive the “Fact check” label next to their stories. To be clear, Google is not manually fact checking articles. The onus is on the author to both fact check the article and add the “Fact check” label to it. Adding the fact check label to a news article is accomplished through a new type of schema markup called ClaimReview. Google says it is especially concerned with publishers adding this markup to “round-up stories that contain multiple fact-check analyses within a single article.” However, it won’t be as simple as writing the article, adding a piece of schema markup code, and hitting the publish button. In order to prevent abuse of the fact check label, there is a strict set of criteria to meet. If Google discovers publishers using the ClaimReview markup, without meeting the criteria, it may ignore the markup or remove the site from Google News altogether. In addition to looking for ClaimReview markup, the search giant says: “We also look for sites that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks.” What exactly that means is up to one’s own interpretation, but it’s likely similar to what is listed in the help article linked to above. Google News’ fact check label is available first in the United States and United Kingdom.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search How to escape iMessage and switch from iPhone to Pixel Chris Davies - Oct 18, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit You want to buy a Google Pixel, but your friends and family are all so firmly embedded in iMessage that you risk banishment to the social hinterlands if you ditch your iPhone. Apple’s smartphones – most recently the iPhone 7 – win plaudits for their design, their camera performance, and their overall simplicity. For many, though, it’s the stickiness of iOS-only apps like iMessage which makes the decision at upgrade time a no-brainer. That’s great news for Apple, but not so hot if you’re wanting to buck the trend and try a different platform out for size. Google’s brand new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, for instance, are wowing reviewers – ourselves included – with its slick Android 7.1 Nougat OS and Siri-besting Google Assistant. Many are curious about replacing their iPhone with a Pixel, but iMessage is usually the most-cited reason for not giving it a go. You could wait for Apple to release an iMessage for Android app, but you’re probably going to be waiting a very long time. Instead, it’s time to go on the offensive. There are plenty of alternatives to iMessage out there, you just need to know the right way to bring your family and friends along for the ride. Know your audience iMessage is a broadly capable messaging system, but often users stick to a core set of features they know and are familiar with. That might be swapping photos with groups, one-on-one chats with lots of stickers, or the convenience of switching from IM to voice calls at a button-press. Other apps can do those things just as well, however. Facebook Messenger has no shortage of stickers, and for many people their entire network is already on the social site. It’ll do easy video calling, too. If your group is made up of photo-sharing fiends, meanwhile, then Google Allo’s tight integration with Google Photos might make a strong argument. That’s doubly so if you point out that, unlike having to pay for extra iCloud photo storage, Google Photos will allow unlimited uploads from your smartphone and other devices. WhatsApp is a hugely popular iMessage alternative, more so outside the US, and for good reason. It’s cross-platform, works on both mobile and desktop devices, and is end-to-end encrypted just like iMessage. It can share documents, photos, and video too, voice messages and make calls, and uses your data connection (or WiFi) rather than your plan’s minutes. If privacy really matters, mind, you might want to pitch Signal. Encrypted individual messages, group texts, picture and video sharing, and no separate account requirement makes it one of the easier options to get started with. It’s also available for both iOS and Android, of course. Have an alternative ready to go Be bold. Screw your courage to the sticking place, and don’t half-ass it. Saying “we should dump iMessage and use X instead because it Y” is going to be a lot more convincing than meekly proposing abandoning Apple’s IM client with no apparent idea of what to use in its place. Go big or go home It’s tempting to treat IM addiction as a war of attrition, singling out one person at a time and weaning them off Apple’s blue-bubbled teat. Problem is, unless a critical mass of people have switched over, there’s little motivation to be the first, lonely few waiting for everyone else to catch up. The only exception to this is if you can cherry-pick some of the more influential people in your network of friends and family, convince them, and then benefit from the snowball effect. If your party-organizing DJ friend (you do have a party-organizing DJ friend, right?) decides they’ll only tell people the details of their next event via WhatsApp, that’s a good reason for your whole social group to jump ship. Be ready with the escape plan You’ve done it, you’ve convinced them. Now you have to strike while the iron is hot. Like a good timeshare salesman, don’t settle for a vague commitment of “oh, I’ll check it out later”: walk them through downloading the replacement app, setting up whatever account they need, and then demo some of the headline features you used in your pitch. Of course, Apple doesn’t make extricating your cellphone number from iMessage easy – certainly not as straightforward as it is to add it to your iTunes account in the first place. The official solution to deregister your number from iMessage is to do it from your iPhone itself. If that doesn’t work – or you don’t have the iPhone any more, you can head over to Apple’s site and deregister it directly. That, frustratingly, doesn’t always work like it should however. Apple warns that it could take a few hours for all of its services to realize you’re off the iMessage gravy train, but if you’re still having issues with IMs and SMS going missing, it’s best to contact support. Don’t be afraid of blackmail This works best if you have a source of infinite cuteness to hang over their head. “If you don’t switch, you won’t see photos of my adorable baby / rambunctious kitten / cosplaying spouse” may not be as morally superior as a technical argument about open-ecosystems, but it can be a lot more effective.

Google Flights is the latest innovative feature from the company and could transform the way travellers from Liverpool John Lennon Airport (LJLA) book holidays in the future. The search engine giants new feature will tell you when the price of a flight is expected to rise, plus it allows you to track flights and set up alerts of when prices fluctuate. The handy tool will compare flight prices on the date you are looking to book with any historic prices to let you know whether it is likely to decrease or increase and helping you save money. Read More This week is the best time to book train travel from Liverpool Lime Street for Christmas The app is being launched in the run up to Christmas in the hopes to make travel planning less stressful for consumers. The company are also aiming to make travel planning and booking on phones much more accessible in general. Find out more below on how the app works and how to use it to the best of your advantage. How does the app work? Notifications on price increases You will be given alerts to inform you that the price is likely to increase or decrease in so many hours Once selecting a flight of your choice a notification may appear telling you in how many hours the fare is likely to increase. For example it may state "£71 fare increase likely in 8 hours" ensuring that your current booking is the ideal time to purchase your flight. Flight fare price comparison tool Similar to Skyscanner and Kayak the app will show you the cheapest flight for the route you are looking to book. So if you can be flexible with your travel dates - say if you're booking months in advance - then this tool will be handy. The app will also give you tips on any expected price jumps using historic prices for that route, as well as when and how much the price is likely to increase. It will also recommend alternate airports, so it may be cheaper to fly to a European city from Manchester rather than LJLA. Tracking your flight If you don't want to book straight away you can choose to track your flight or route, receiving notifications to your email letting you know when fares are expected to change - whether that's an increase or decrease.

It will give you destinations based off the type of holiday you want. Then you can search for hotel in that area for example 'hotels in Berlin' and the app will label hotels when the price is lower than usual, or if there is discounted rates to the normal rate for those travel dates. You can filter to the likes of 'Deals', 'Cheap' or 'Top Rated'. Google announced that the app will be availble to download on smart phones in the coming weeks.

"Google's ambitious new smartphone, the Pixel, doesn't offer a lot that's new. Yet it's still one of the best out there," The Associated Press' Anick Jesdanun concludes. Google's new Pixel phone has a sleek design that struck reviewers as familiar, if uninspired. While the pricey phone, starting at $649.99, faces some criticism of its photo quality, battery life and speed, other reviewers were blown away by its artificial intelligence, camera and software. Wall Street Journal With a sleek design, sharper display, good camera, and smarter voice-activated assistant, Pixel provides a compelling sell to iPhone 7 users, The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern writes. The battery life falls a bit short on the regular-sized model, but it charges faster than an iPhone, she says. She says the biggest challenge is the software. While the apps work more fluidly than Apple's iOS or other Android versions, and the updates are automatic, Stern notes that her friends and family are already entrenched in Apple's iMessage. Plus, Google's Assistant logs queries, she writes. "The Assistant works great but you have to be willing to let Google be Big Brother," Stern wrote. Getty Images Members of the media examine Google's Pixel phone during an event to introduce Google hardware products on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco, California. New York Times Brian X. Chen takes a more downbeat view in The New York Times, calling the phone "mediocre" and "underwhelming." "It is slower than Apple's iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung's smaller flagship phone. Photos shot with Pixel's camera don't look as good as the iPhone's. And Google's built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb. But hey, the Pixel probably won't burn down your garage or injure a child." Chen ran into some glitches with Google Assistant when trying to use natural language requests, and noted that the camera seemed to "exaggerate cyans and magentas," making images appear colder. Unlike Stern, Chen wasn't taken with the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone. Still, for Android loyalists, Chen recommends Project Fi, Google's experimental wireless service, which he found to be reliable and a "good, frugal option." The Verge and Recode Personal tech guru Walt Mossberg writes that the Pixel is the first-rate Android phone that, at long last, will shake up the industry. "Suddenly, there's no longer an Apple-Samsung duopoly in premium handsets," he wrote. The design is familiar, pleasant but conservative, Mossberg notes, and the Android platform is easy to use. "The Pixel is easily the best Android phone I've ever tested, and seems to hail from a different planet than the chunky, clumsy and pokey 2008 G1 which introduced Android to the world," Mossberg wrote in The Verge and Recode. The phone comes with a few minor inconveniences, he says: It doesn't ship with earbuds, and when asked for the ingredients of apple pie, Google's Assistant fails to list "apples." But it still outflanks Siri, according to Mossberg. The battery life fell short of 10 hours during Mossberg's test, below the 13 hours promised, and the camera was a bit weaker than the iPhone 7 in dim light, he says. Plus, Google's 24-hour chat support just isn't the same as going to an Apple store. Getty Images Members of the media examine Google's Pixel phone during an event to introduce Google hardware products on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco, California. USA Today USA Today's Ed Baig called the Pixel a "winner," noting two positives right off the bat: the presence of a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and the lack of a bump to accommodate the camera. The access to unlimited cloud storage boosts the usefulness of the Pixel's high-end camera, according to Baig, and he, too, notes how smart Google Assistant is when responding to more complicated queries. "I asked the Assistant to 'tell me about my day' and it reported my local weather, told me what appointments I had coming and how long my commute would take. Without prompting, it then played radio broadcasts from NPR, Fox, News, Bloomberg, and BBC. When I asked it to show me pictures of Sydney with horses, it correctly surmised that I meant my daughter Sydney rather than Sydney, Australia, and found pictures I'd taken of of her with horses in my Google Photos stash. When I instead asked the Assistant to 'show me pictures of Sydney with bridges' it pulled pictures of the Sydney Harbour Bridge off the web. Google Assistant was also able to translate 'how do I find a bathroom in French?' into that language. Given the same query, Siri pointed me to the web. To be fair, on some complicated requests, the Assistant also directed me to the web. Google Assistant was able to identify songs where I only knew a few of the lyrics and played them, sometimes, through YouTube. Still, Baig notes, the phone has only a single speaker and lacks the same level of water-resistance as competitors. show chapters <p>Google announces its new phone Pixel</p> <p>At Google&#039;s hardware event, hardware division SVP Rick Osterloh introduces its new phone, Pixel.</p> Google announces its new phone Pixel    Tuesday, 4 Oct 2016 | 12:19 PM ET | 02:14 CNET Industry website CNET gives the Pixel a score of 8.8, the same as the iPhone 7 Plus. The phone's camera is "mostly awesome," said Lynn La, with a wide enough front-facing lens to take flattering selfies. Still, the camera wasn't as sharp in dim lighting, the artsy "blur" effect is patchy, and the video stabilization gave shots a "surreal, almost drone-like quality," plus, you're limited to Verizon among the four major U.S. carriers, she said. "But the Pixel is a beaut," La wrote. "It runs fast and comes at a time when the largest Android phone maker, Samsung, is hitting some rough luck." Business Insider Pixel showcases what Google does best: finding information, a la Google Assistant. The hardware itself, however, is "easily the least exciting part" of the phone, BI's Steve Kovach wrote. "Google also has a major advantage over Apple. It has always been better at software and services, and nothing proves that more than Google Assistant, the new digital helper that lives inside the Pixel and future Google-made products like the Google Home speaker. The Pixel phone is a taste of a future in which hardware matters less and the artificial intelligence that powers it takes precedence. And no one is better positioned to take advantage of that future at the moment than Google." While some called the Pixel "bland," its ability to check the best-in-class boxes impressed shareholders: Shares were up more than 2 percent Tuesday.

Google open sources the code that powers its domain registry Posted Oct 18, 2016 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story This DIY Stranger Things light kit will make you forget about Barb Google today released Nomulus, the Java-based registry platform that powers Google’s own .google and .foo top level domains (TLDs). Google says it started working on the technology behind Nomulus after the company applied to operate a number of generic TLDs itself back in 2012. Until then, domain names were mostly restricted to the .com’s, .net’s and various country-level TLDs like .de and .uk. Once the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) decided to open TLDs up to so-called generic TLD’s like .app, .blog and .guru, Google jumped into the fray and applied for .google and a number of other TLDs. Nomulus is the platform it uses to manage all the registration data for domains that fall under its TLDs (think blog.google). Among other things, this platform handles all of the requests to buy, renew and transfer domains. While you may be buying a domain name from GoDaddy, for example, you’re really just using GoDaddy as an intermediary between you and the TLD’s owner. While Nomulus is open source (and released under the Apache 2.0 license), it’s worth noting that it is tightly integrated with Google’s Cloud Platform. It runs on App Engine and uses the Google Cloud Datastore as its backend database. Google says Donuts, which owns over 2 300 of these generic TLDs, also contributed to the Nomulus code base and will soon make a public test version available, too.

He was also the science officer on the Starship Enterprise. And after using Google’s new Pixel XL smartphone, I feel like that I have been transported to the 23rd century in the era of Spock and the USS Enterprise. One definitely gets a sense that this phone could’ve been something that was part of Spock’s daily toolkit which also included his trusty scientific tricorter. The thing about the Pixel is that it is not only a device which is home to Google’s new AI assistant, but it has been supposedly designed from top to bottom by it – hardware and software wise, an approach its neighbor from Cupertino is known for. And Google is the company which for years has been trying to bring the computer from the USS Enterprise from the fictional world of Star Trek to reality. This phone is culmination of a new hardware empire that Google intends to build with AI at its heart. And they have made an impressive phone indeed, which again I’d reiterate would be the phone that Spock could’ve perhaps ended up with if the such gadgetry was a real thing back in the 60s. If you’re not getting what I am trying to insinuate, then basically I am saying this is a totally sci-fi phone which has a metal finish, rounded edges and a glass section on the back which is probably there for the sake of show and also to integrate the antennas. Looks wise, it may not be the most handsome thing, but it is well built, light, ergonomic and well, in its greyish black, it totally looks like something that would belong on a space ship. You fire up the device, you will be welcomed by this gorgeous AMOLED screen that is also home to a delightful spread of wallpapers, techno ringtones and a new Pixel launcher for Android Nougat which looks rad. Now, the entire experience isn’t centered around widgets and icons but also a multitude of swipe gestures which represent what Google thinks is a good UI for a smartphone like gadget. Gone is the app drawer button, which now instead can be summoned by a swipe up and there’s also a new notification center with simplified controls. This is Android Nougat at its clean and functional best and I doubt any other smartphone brand would be able to outfit their phone with software that is as utilitarian and clean as the Pixel. I am training my gun towards Apple which has improved a lot with iOS 10, but boy Android looks like a treat on the Pixel. And underpinning the entire experience is the ‘Assistant’ which remains omnipresent and context aware all the time. It is also damned good in picking up what I am saying and understanding my context in environments as loud as pubs which are home to a rancorous inebriated bunch of teens who are literally trying to throw the kitchen sink at the DJ who is blasting tunes. As far as Assistants go, Google has the chops and it is flexing its muscles. In one day alone, a fully trained Siri on my iPhone was put to shame, just the way the all-conquering folks at Mercedes have been putting the Italian Prancing Horse of Ferrari to shame in the fastest racing sport in the world. Google has also improved the always underperforming camera. It claims the Pixel has the best smartphone camera and it throws the DxO mark rating of 89 on your face. In my tests the camera was impressive, but I am yet to come down to a conclusion and that is something I wish to reserve for a more thorough analysis of the assistant. Performance, as you’d imagine is top class, something worthy of the USS Enterprise. And it should be as this is a device running Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 chipset. You get dollops of RAM and memory and a fat ass battery which supports quick charging. Google is promising that it wouldn’t face a potential ‘Warp Core Breach’ as Samsung’s recent phones have witnessed and I am inclined to believe this. Overall, the Pixel is expensive and it shows incredible promise which is worthy of the legendary Captain Spock of the Enterprise. That’s high praise – praise often reserved for the iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy. This year, Google has it easier too with Samsung’s Note 7 being exorcised from the market, it only needs to outpace the one from Cupertino. At Rs 57,000 Google is being bold, but this could be the ultimate for those who fancy Android and Spock. In the meanwhile folks - ‘Live Long and Prosper’.

The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button is a quirky part of Google's history. The button still exists on the Google.com home page, but thanks to interface improvements, it has become something of a vestigial feature. The freshly released Google Assistant on the Google Pixel phones can be thought of as the next generation of Google Search, and sure enough, the "I'm Feeling Lucky" phrase has come along for the ride. Say "OK Google, I'm Feeling Lucky" to the Google Assistant, and you'll be whisked away to a crazy audio-only trivia game show. Theme music starts playing, the Google Assistant introduces itself, the audience cheers, and the questions start. It's complete with audience reactions, a buzzer, and quippy one-liners from the Google Assistant. If you've ever played You Don't Know Jack before, you know the drill. The game supports multiple players, but there's no way to "buzz in." It just does round robin-style play, with each player taking turns to answer a question. The Assistant keeps score, so at the end you'll get to see who is the trivia champion. The Assistant is only on the Google Pixel right now, so there aren't too many people who can actually try Google's wacky game show. We'll bet it will work on the Google Home, too, once that comes out. Listing image by CBS Expand full story Reader comments 25 You must login or create an account to comment.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek The Best Keyboard Apps for Android The interactions you have with your phone’s keyboard are easily some of the most intimate relationships that you will have with your mobile device. It is the mouth through which all your texts, emails, and other messages are spoken, and frankly…typing on a small keyboard is a pain. So choosing the right one can make things all the easier. Not only that, but you have to trust it with your sensitive data (like passwords) and everything else you type. So which should you choose? The Best for Most People: Google Keyboard RELATED ARTICLE How to Add a Shortcut to Google Keyboard’s Settings in Andorid’s App Drawer It’s really hard for the average user to go wrong with Google Keyboard. It’s fast, efficient, and already a part of the Google ecosystem, so you’re not sharing any information with a third party (that doesn’t already have all your info, at least). Google has gone to great lengths to make Google Keyboard better than ever, with more advanced predictions engines and autocorrect algorithms, as well as sought-after features like gesture typing (à la Swype). Plus, it isn’t bogged down with extra features, so you can always count on it being fast and smooth–unlike some other keyboards, which can occasionally feel a bit laggy. Though it does have some nice options, including themes, a custom dictionary, and other things you’ve come to expect from a mobile keyboard.   If you’re using a stock Android device, then you probably already have Google Keyboard installed—it’s the default option on Nexus devices (as well as most others running “pure” Android). If not, though, there’s good news: Google Keyboard is available as a free download in the Play Store. If nothing else, you can give it a shot and see if it’s the right option for you. The Best for Extra Customization: SwiftKey SwiftKey has been a long-time favorite on Android, thanks to its highly accurate predication engine and typing accuracy. In recent years it’s gotten a makeover of sorts, with the company stripping superfluous features that slowed the keyboard down and adding more desirable tools to the mix. Still, it’s worth mentioning that it is sometimes known to lag on certain devices–it just bogs down under pressure. I’ve personally seen it happen on a handful of devices (like the Galaxy S7 Edge), but had perfect results out of it on others (like the Nexus 6P). Really, it’s a crap shoot, but still worth a shot. Of all SwiftKey’s features, it’s ability to “learn” how you type is easily the most powerful. The more you use it, the more accurate it gets and the better it’s able to predict your next word (or words!). This is far and away the best reason to consider SwiftKey as your main keyboard, but that also makes it more difficult to tell if you like the keyboard in a short-term use case. You have to really use it for awhile to see how powerful it is. It also connects to your Google account, so your typing style and custom dictionary are synced across devices. Like Google Keyboard, SwiftKey also has gesture typing (called “Flow”), as well as a solid theme engine that allows for customization of how the keyboard looks. Where Google Keyboard is a more lightweight option that focuses on ease-of-use, SwiftKey packs a lot of options under its hood. So if there’s something you don’t like about it, dig around in its Settings—there’s a good chance you can change it.   SwiftKey is a free download in the Play Store, but contains in-app purchases for themes and such. All of the core functionality is available in for free, however, so it’s definitely worth trying out. There’s also a beta version if you like to live on the edge and try new features before they’re available in the stable channel. The Best for Extensions (like GIFs): Fleksy Ask most people which keyboard they use on Android, and Fleksy will probably never get a mention. It’s easily the newest keyboard on this list, but it’s not one you should sleep on, either: it’s powerful, fast, has a crazy-accurate autocorrect engine, and brings some pretty insane features that others simply don’t have.   While its autocorrect engine is probably the biggest reason to give this keyboard a shot, there are also things that make it instantly unique, like the ability to add GIFs directly from the keyboard. Yeah, GIFs. If you love sharing hilariously-accurate animated images with your friends, coworkers, or even people you barely know, this is a keyboard to take for a spin.   But that’s not all—this is also the only keyboard on the list to make use of an extension system. With these built-in extensions, you’re able to do things like launch apps instantly from the keyboard, quickly edit text, add text shortcuts, and a lot more. Like SwiftKey, Fleksy is free to use, but also contains in-app purchases for things like themes. Again, however, all of the core functionality is available for free. Choice is one of the things that makes Android so desirable by many—choice of phone manufacturers, choice of custom skins, choice of software preferences, among others. With Android, most of the time you don’t just “get what you get,” but can instead change most of the things that you don’t like. As personal a choice as keyboards are, you should definitely exercise this right and take a look at some of the other options available to you.

Our Google Pixel review is still forthcoming as we’ve been diving deep into the device and everything it has to offer. As you can tell if you read our 40+ Google Pixel tips and tricks and the first 15 things you should do with your Google Pixel, we’ve been playing with it. A lot. Pixel and Pixel XL Reviews But while we gather our final thoughts, we know it’s important for you to make an informed decision leading up to the October 20th release date for those who want the phone the day it’s made available. That’s why we’ve scoured the web to dig up the early Pixel and Pixel XL reviews for you to check out in one place. Engadget (Score: 86/100) [The Pixels] have their share of shortcomings, like a drab design, wimpy water resistance and some hefty price tags. The thing is, Google had to start somewhere, and the foundation it built with these two phones is a surprisingly strong one. These aren’t just great first attempts at smartphones; these are great smartphones, period, and every other Android device maker out there should be a little worried. The Verge (Score: 9/10) This is Google’s first phone, and for a first effort it is remarkably good. By almost every metric I can think of — speed, power, camera, smart assistant, you name it — it matches or exceeds the best phones available on the market today. And though the design is far from groundbreaking, it’s certainly approachable. Wired I’m totally in love with the Pixel. I love this camera, I love Google Assistant, I love that I’ll get to use it with a comfy VR headset, I love that I finally get a version of Android that is both powerful and attractive. I love that there’s a kickass Android phone that (probably) doesn’t explode. The immediate joke everyone, including me, made on Twitter after the Pixel launch was that Google made an iPhone. Well, that’s true. As it turns out, an iPhone running Android is exactly what I’ve been waiting for. Android Police The Pixel does almost everything well. In fact, it does most things very well. And it does a few things exceptionally, like taking photos. So if you’ve pre-ordered a Pixel, I have a feeling you won’t be disappointed: it’s a delight to use, and I’m already deeply attached to the Pixel XL I’ve been carrying for the past five days. Venture Beat With the Pixels, it seems like the tradeoff is much better, but it will cost you accordingly. This is the best Android phone on the market that money can buy. As is often the case with Android, that will likely change in half a year when Samsung and its competitors start releasing their latest. But for now, if you have the money to get the latest and greatest, you can’t go wrong with the Pixel and Pixel XL. CNet (Score: 4.5/5) The Pixel represents a new era for Google phones, and it’s off to a strong start. True, it has its flaws. It’s not truly water resistant like its main rivals and its battery life isn’t impressive. But the Pixel is a beaut. It runs fast and comes at a time when the largest Android phone maker, Samsung, is hitting some rough luck. TechCrunch When yours is the only name on a handset, you’d better put your best foot forward. Sure, the company got manufacturing help from its friends at HTC, but the message is clear — sink or swim, it’s all on Google. And on just about every count, the company delivers. It’s a well-designed (if aesthetically neutral) handset with robust specs and a killer screen and camera. Android Central With Pixel, the company finally delivers on what we’d wanted all along from a Google phone. With each cycle of Nexus handsets, it used to be a question of “What would they screw up this time?” We’re far beyond that with this new, singular vision of what a Google Android phone should be. And I can’t think of a better phone to buy going into 2017. Will you buy one? By now you probably have a good idea of whether you want one. The only question, then, is if you’re ready to part ways with at least $650 to snag arguably Google’s first — and best — phone yet. We don’t have our answer to that question just yet — stay on the lookout for our final review in the days to come — but if you’ve made your mind up one way or another, we want to hear about it.

They’re Google’s attempt to define itself as a hardware manufacturer worthy of comparison not just to Apple’s iPhone, but the very products its Android operating system has allowed to flourish over the past eight years. Or, as the refrain goes: Google is finally going to compete with other smartphone manufacturers. This narrative can get in the way of discussing the Pixel for what it is (a smartphone), so I’ll try to avoid confusing what this phone means to Google as a company and what it means to you as a consumer.

Written by Shruti Dhapola | Updated: October 20, 2016 4:07 pm Google Pixel is an ambitious project from search giant to take on the Apple iPhone and its premium tag. Here is our first impression of the device. Google Pixel, the first official smartphone with an all-Google branding, has arrived. The device, which starts at Rs 57,000 is Google’s ambitious project to take on the Apple iPhone and its premium tag. In a world where the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is dead, and the iPhone 7 appears like an incremental upgrade to some, Pixel wants to take on the title of the best Android smartphone, one that isn’t just about the Android platform but also about the best of what Google has to offer. Here is our experience so far with Google Pixel XL 32GB ‘Very Silver’ review device. Setting up Google Pixel and Pixel XL have some exclusive features. Like we have said before, this is about the best of Google, and setting up this device is actually quite easy. Google has given a special data transfer tool which is a Type-C USB port on one and a regular USB on one end. Just plug that into your new Pixel and old iPhone/Android and you’ll be able to transfer all your data.

All my text messages from Moto Z waiting for me in the folder, which is pretty impressive. I will be wiping this device clean though, to start over with my iPhone. But the thought of switching off iMessage before I do so is a little terrifying. Do note that setting up requires a fast Internet connection as Google Play Store will start downloading all the apps once again, after it has transferred all the apps. Even on my slow mobile network, close to nine apps were updated. With my faster home broadband network, the rest of the apps (around 24 of them) took less than half an hour. Interestingly, on apps like Antutu Benchmark, I could still see the test for the Moto Z getting reflected as the last data. And yes, the phone remembered my WiFi password for my home because it was used on the earlier device. Getting to the Assistant While setting-up Google will ask you fine-tune the Assistant, the highlight of this phone. Yes you can still see the Google Now cards if you swipe right from the edge of the screen, but Assistant claims to do a little more. Google Assistant is part of the on-screen home button; long press and the assistant is activated. Just like with Google Now you can say ‘Ok Google’ and get it to do stuff like send Messages. In this case, SMS and Hangouts are the options. Surprisingly, Allo doesn’t appear in the list, but that could be because I’ve yet to set up the app. Also I had to download Hangouts on the phone as it doesn’t come pre-installed. Google Assistant can go through Photos and find your pictures from a particular vacation as well, although this works on Google Now as well. Google Assistant is part of the on-screen home button; long press and the assistant is activated. Google Assistant appears to do a lot of the stuff that your Google Now can do as well. However, it is a lot more conversational, and yes you can say things like “I’m bored” and see how it goes. The difference with the Assistant and Google Now is that the former can have a conversation with you about random stuff. Since this is machine learning in its infancy, the answers are not always perfect. Plus, Google plans to add third-party app support to Assistant, just like how Apple did for Siri to make it more useful. Right now Assistant is a slightly more advanced version of Google Now, and we’ll have to wait and see how soon its capabilities are boosted. When the third-party apps come, it will be interesting to watch how Assistant evolves. Camera Camera is the other big feature of the Pixel smartphone that Google is touting. Google isn’t relying on OIS in the 12.3 MP rear camera, and instead is talking about EIS and software wizardry to give you pictures which are stunning. I’ve not had much time to play around with this, but I have to say one thing it is fast and there’s no shutter lag, even in low-light. Are the results better than an iPhone 7 or S7 edge? I wouldn’t say so yet, and I’m hoping to use this around more to see how it responds to different lighting conditions. There’s no manual mode in the camera app as such, although users can tinker with exposure. Meanwhile below are some shots I just took in low-light conditions in my house. Sample shot from Google Pixel XL. (Image resized for web) Sample shot from Google Pixel XL. (Image resized for web) We’ll have more on the Google Pixel XL in the coming week. Our focus with this phone is going to be on the camera, the software, and yes the Google Assistant. For now, I’ll try and find the courage to replace my iPhone with the Pixel XL, which I admit is not so easy. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don’t like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 14: Latest News Ahead of special session, Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal yet to accept Cong MLAs’ resignation In complete reversal, President Obama refuses to criticize Donald Trump Poland exhumes president, others killed in 2010 plane crash Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton tell Democrats not to despair Catholic bishops ask Donald Trump for humane immigration policies Shruti DhapolaLooking at technology and web culture.... read more Asus Zenfone 3 Laser review: Good phone, but pricey for its specs Fake news and how it is killing democracy through social media timelines Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes gone: Paytm to MobiKwik, digital wallets are rejoicing                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

The service that already allows travelers to view flights from multiple airlines will now track prices, advise on the best time to book and fly based on historical pricing data, and find hotel deals. The new features are meant to help users wrangle all the factors that go into booking a flight--from choosing a destination and the optimal times to purchase and travel. It'll also help you compare prices between airports and airlines and book a hotel. Below is a deeper look at how Google Flights might make your holidays brighter: Search If you're looking at a specific location but haven't yet chosen a flight, Google's improved Search will offer advice--providing tips on days, times and airports that offer the best deal. Once you choose a specific flight, you'll see predictions on whether the price is expected to change--and by how much--to make sure you're getting the best deal. Explore The new Explore feature allows travelers to search based on the type of destination they have in mind. If you are traveling to a certain region, but flexible on the exact location, the Explore feature can search flights based on the best deal or shortest layovers. Hotels Google already flags hotel prices that are above or below the average price, but its new feature will surface all hotels that are currently offering a deal in your desired location. And Google says all of these features are mobile friendly. Throughout the process, you can sign up to track flight and hotel prices via email notifications.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 15, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Seven ways to avoid content cannibalization Content SEO 18 Oct 16 | Meri Chobanyan Facebook0 Linkedin136 Google+13 Twitter 149 There’s currently a lot of discussion about how to improve your domain’s SEO. Many issues are labeled as dramatically influential and people are always sharing tips on how to deal with them. However, one topic is seldom discussed within SEO circles: internal content cannibalization. Why should we care? SEO experts and digital marketers have long been contemplating whether or not there’s such a thing as a Google penalty for duplicate content. As it turns out, it’s a myth. However, we cannot simply sit back and relax. In fact, there’s one thing worse than “duplicate content” – “too similar” content, which can be a stone around your website’s neck. Pieces of content that are too similar are the real cannibals here, since the duplicates are being filtered. Thus, having this kind of content on your site can ruin its potential, because your own URLs will be competing against your other URLs. We know that Google doesn’t like to rank multiple pages from the same domain. So, one or the other gets picked eventually: one day Google picks one page from your domain, another day a different one gets displayed, thus, you end up losing your potential traffic. We call it the “seesaw effect.” When you have different pages that contain too-similar content, basically, you confuse the Google bot as to which page from your site it should rank for key terms. So, to get some insight into the matter of internal site cannibalization, SEMrush recently hosted an in-depth discussion about the subject with an industry expert – Dawn Anderson, lecturer in digital and search marketing, researcher and international SEO consultant. Based on our talk, we have outlined seven ways to avoid internal site cannibalization. 1) Internal linking Cause: “Skewed ‘popularity’ via internal linking, which will cause a particular page to be displayed instead of another regardless of relevancy.” To clarify this point, let’s say, you have a website for selling shoes online. It also includes a blog. You definitely want your homepage to be as popular as possible in search results pages; however, you end up earning more traffic with your blog. When reviewing your internal linking, you may find that many internal links point to your blog, which is ranked higher. Why is that? Because the more links you provide to a page, the more important Google considers it be! Solution: Review your internal link structure, and place what’s most important higher within the hierarchy of your pages. If you use the latter, you can launch a simple site audit, which will automatically check your domain for duplicate links and tags, and even provide some suggestions for improvement. 2) Anchor text inconsistency Cause: Overuse of keywords with anchors that refer to the wrong page, which creates spam within your own URL Let’s consider our shoes website example once again. Your anchors should always be concise and get right to the point! If you anchor says “buy shoes,” after clicking “buy shoes,” your visitor should be able to do so right away – do not digress elsewhere. Don’t, for example, create a transitional page on “shoe sizes” or something else. Preciseness lends clarity, and clarity leads to higher rankings in search engines. Solution: Make sure your keywords are natural, useful and mapped to the right page – that way, you are sending all the right hints to Google from within your own website to your URLs. 3) Canonicalization (incorrect or missing canonicalization) A page’s canonicalization is basically a tag at its head claiming that it contains either exactly duplicated or too-similar content. Cause: When you purposefully use duplicate or too-similar content within your URL, make sure you canonicalize it. However, if you canonicalize too much, it doesn’t do you any good either – Google may consider it to be messy and may ignore the page completely. Solution: Pay attention to the way you canonicalize: Canonicalization with or without a trailing slash is different Don’t forget to switch your canonicals when migrating content to HTTPS Self-referencing canonicalization can help if your content gets scraped Avoid canonicalization of URLs if the content is too different (if your content actually differs quite substantially, canonicalization will only be detrimental) Use a “rel=canonical element” Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin136 Google+13 Twitter 149 Related articles Google’s mobile-first index: how to prepare your business How Black Friday can lead to valuable organic search opportunities Guide to 301 redirects and canonical tags Eight content marketing trends to think about in 2017 4) Page title and other meta differentiation Cause: Different URLs ranking for the same term in your industry’s seasonal periods, or optimizing several pages for the same terms (even unwittingly). For instance, in our previous example, our primary term is “shoes.” Thus, we optimize our main page to appear in response to a keyword “shoes”. However, in the summer you decide to target an audience looking for “summer shoes,” so you create a separate page with that name. Eventually, you end up with two pages on which “shoes” appears simultaneously, and your “summer shoes” page is killing the potential of your primary target page. Solution: Avoid over-optimization for primary terms on non-targeted pages, and under-optimization for secondary target pages 5) Merging content for concentration Cause: Stealing power from your own target via variants, stemming, synonyms, or associated keywords. For instance, you have four pages that are dedicated to “Shoes Care” in winter/summer/spring/autumn period. Thus, you have created four separate pages that could actually be tied into one big category “How to Look After Shoes”. Solution: Focus on theme level, section and page level, avoid silos. How? Firstly, you can do a content audit, and afterwards, concentrate rather than dilute – try to make one page instead of two. 6) Intent to content mapping Cause: Lack of logic within your site structure. For example, you have a blog within your site, however, if you do not provide some logic and order to the navigation within you blog, Google will also consider it as a source of cannibalization. Thus, you end up being cannibalized by illogical blog categories (rather than five random topics, make a category and divide it to topics afterwards). Provide no competition with your primary target page (see point 5). Solution: Surround your content with a sectional environment of contextual relevance. 7) If you can’t improve (for now), noindex (temporarily) and then improve. Just don’t forget to index later! If you cannot identify the problem, here are some possible symptoms: Different pages ranking for the same term Hovering on page 2 Never quite achieving those top spots Different URLs ranking for the same terms during your industry’s seasonal periods Not getting the CTR (click-through rate) despite ranking reasonably well Shared impressions in Google Search Console for different pages for the same terms You can always rely on specially designed tools to help you with your website audit; they can point out weaknesses and help you decrease the possibility of internal cannibalization.

At least those are the results from my skewed polls I run here. I asked back about a month ago, if Google should confirm more of those unconfirmed updates. 77% said yes, while only 11% said no, Google shouldn't confirm more updates. In fact, if Google did, I wouldn't be called out by Gary Illyes as not seeing the RankBrain update. He said at PubCon that no one noticed, not even me. Hehe. "Even @rustybrick didn't notice when RankBrain went live." @methode #pubcon— Jennifer Slegg (@jenstar) October 13, 2016 I said that wasn't true, but he said it was true: @rustybrick @jenstar you didn't notice it. Fact.— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 13, 2016 If you look, we learned about RankBrain in October based on an article from Bloomberg that said it launched a few months earlier. I have several blog posts of unconfirmed Google updates from that timeframe: I didn't know it was "RankBrain" or machine learning but we did notice shifts, changes and unconfirmed updates. You can see my lists of all of these in the Google updates category which dates back December 3, 2003 about the Florida update. In any event, at least in this case, it would be nice to know when RankBrain started rolling out and have more of this confirmed. Of course, Google would need a staff to stay on top of confirming or denying all my update requests. Forum discussion continued at Twitter. This post was scheduled to go live today but was written earlier - I am currently offline today.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel Review: Android redefined, by Google By Juan Carlos Torres - October 18, 2016 5 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Just when you thought that 2016 was practically over as far as the big smartphones are concerned, Google drops us a bombshell of a device. And no, we’re not talking about a literal exploding smartphone. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are, indeed, groundbreaking smartphones in the history of Android, tough less because of the specs and more because of its features and implications. But for now, we set aside the conspiracies and ignore the conspiracies. For now, we dig deep into those very hardware and software features to see if the Pixel is truly a blast or just a dud. Design As with any smartphone, the first thing people will notice will be the device’s design. And knowing that it’s a “Google phone”, the Pixel’s appearance will naturally be subjected to even more scrutiny. Unfortunately, the Pixel leaves a lasting first impression that can be described as “ambiguous” at best. And we’re not even talking about its similarities to the iPhone. There will naturally be comparisons between the Pixel and the iPhone. Fortunately for Android fans, any similarity between the two is really only skin deep, limited really to the spacious bezels at the top and bottom of the Pixel’s face. Unfortunately for Android fans, some of the details that do make the Pixel unique aren’t exactly flattering. Yes, we’re talking about the “dual tone” design at the back. The glass section on the rear of the Pixel is supposedly for supporting IR functionality. We can bet, however, that Google designers could have come up with something less obnoxious. While beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder, expect that this element of the smartphone’s design to be the biggest target of criticism. The rest of the smartphone, fortunately, is convincingly premium, both in build and in appearance. The Pixel boasts of an aluminum body that has benefited from HTC’s years of experience making its One flagships. In fact, the Pixel sports a ridge that is reminiscent of the HTC 10 itself. The Pixel is otherwise plain and unadorned, as you might expect. Ports and openings are kept at a minimum, though, thankfully, Google hasn’t thrown out the 3.5 mm audio jack just yet. Sticking true to some of its conventions on the Nexus, the Pixel neither has a removable battery nor a microSD card slot. As buyers are limited to choosing between a basic 32 GB storage or a more expensive 128 GB configuration, users will basically have to resort to the cloud, Google’s cloud specifically, for anything in between. Which is exactly what Google wants for the Pixel anyway. Google’s Android More than simply the smartphone hardware, which is common by now, or the design, which some might find disagreeable, the Pixel is, more than any other Android device in the market today, all about Google. Even the Nexus doesn’t hold a candle to how much Google there is inside of the Pixel. Google’s ads makes sure that everyone knows that the Pixel was made by Google. And it isn’t just about the device either. Of course, it’s still Android, 7.1 Nougat to be exact, and is easily identified as Android. But it is so different from the Android you see today, even on the Nexus, that you could almost consider it a custom OEM Android spin. Given that Google has basically become an OEM with the Pixel, that would be an accurate assertion. There’s a new app launcher and home screen, for example. Circular icons abound, previously only possible with customized ROMs and skins. And those icons do more than just look pretty. A long on would makes some actions pop up. Which actions those are depends on the app in question. Sounds familiar? It’s pretty much like the 3D Touch found in the latest iPhone models and surely parallels will be drawn here as well. The app grid itself no longer has a dedicated icon to summon it. Instead, users have to swipe from the bottom up to, well, bring it up. It’s a rather odd compromise between having a dedicated icon for an app grid or list and not having an app grid at all. Like iOS. The Pixel is, unsurprisingly, preloaded with Google-centric experiences and apps. Allo and Duo are installed by default, edging Hangouts out of the picture. Photos are automatically backed to Google’s cloud, and Pixel owners are given an infinite amount of space for that. But the real star of the show, and what will ultimately set the Pixel apart for months, or even years, to come, is Google’s latest stab at a personal AI-powered butler: Google Assistant. Google Assistant Google Assistant really isn’t a surprise. What was a surprise was how much emphasis Google put on it. To the point that it is the one software feature that, at least officially, is exclusively available on the Pixel. At least for now. Google will inevitably release Assistant to a wider audience, but it doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to do so any time soon. Especially when it needs it to be a major selling point for the Pixel. Google Assistant combines all of Google’s search and machine learning technologies under one roof, from Google Search itself, to Google Now, to Now on Tap. It utilizes Google’s knowledge graph to tell you where the nearest Chinese takeout is. It employs text and image recognition to offer trivia about the movie poster you’re looking at. And it utilizes machine learning to predict what you’re going to ask it next. Unlike other personal assistants, Google Assistant is able to hold a conversation. Or is at least advertised to. If you ask it something, it won’t be content to simply spit out the direct answer. It will suggest follow-up questions so you won’t have to ask them yourself. But should you choose to do so, it correctly remembers the thread of the conversation and will pick up where you left of. That is, if you’re lucky to have Assistant understand your every utterance. Google Assistant is completely voice-driven. There’s no way to type your queries, you really have to speak out loud. Which means it can falter once in a while. And when it does, it loses the context of your conversation and becomes no better than the likes of Siri or Cortana. Google Assistant holds a lot of promise and makes even more promises. But in its current incarnation in the Pixel, it is clearly still rough around the edges. It is, after all, practically in version 1.0. If Google is indeed serious in betting on AI for its future, we can expect the Assistant to grow by leaps and bounds in the coming months. Camera Spec sheets can be deceiving and the ultimate proof of that is the Google Pixel’s camera. On paper, it is not much better than the one found in the previous gen Nexus 6P, a Sony IMX378 on the Pixel versus an IMX377 on the Nexus. It has a 12.3 megapixel sensor, an f/2.0 lens, PDAF and Laser AF, and dual LED flash. On the front, the same 8-megapixel IMX179 as the Nexus 6P. In practice, however, the camera performs surprisingly well, confirming DxOMark rather early assessment. It’s a remarkable feat, considering the camera doesn’t even have that much-desired Optical Image Stabilization. That last bit might shock those who have been following trends in mobile photography for the past three or so years. OIS has always been the holy grail, so why is Google ditching it in favor of EIS? As explained before, Google believes that EIS and its software algorithms are more than enough to fill in the shoes left by OIS. Plus, it allowed Google to banish the accursed camera bump as well. It sounds almost too good to be true, but let the photos speak for themselves. Of course, the camera works best in bright light, but it was able to produce acceptable images, albeit with some expected grain. Autofocus, both of them, worked fast and accurately and the EIS really proves its worth in low-light and when recording videos. It’s not perfect, mind you, as sudden changes in lighting can make autofocus and stabilization lose their bearing for a bit. Still, for a camera that lacks OIS, it’s an impressive feat nonetheless. Google is able to accomplish photography magic without the use of dedicated hardware. A bokeh effect, for example, can be achieved even without the benefit of a second camera sensor. HDR+ is also a huge benefit, so much so that Google has set it to be always on by default. Burst shots are supported even with HDR+ enabled, though there is some processing lag after you release the shutter. Performance Almost in stark contrast, there really isn’t much to say about the Pixel’s performance. Ignoring the usual benchmarks for the moment, the smartphone operates smooth as butter, benefiting from Google’s more direct control over both software and hardware. It doesn’t hurt that the Pixel is equipped with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 and Adreno 530 GPU, with ample 4 GB of RAM. Of course, the processor does more work on the Pixel XL due to its 5.5-inch 2560×1440 WQHD screen, versus the smaller 5.0-inch Pixel and its 1920×1080 FHD display. Audio has never been a strong suit of any Nexus smartphone, and it seems that, at least for now, Google isn’t changing that tradition. Failing to utilize all that empty space on the face of the Pixel, the speakers are, instead, bottom blasting. They’re also nothing to write home about, either. Fortunately, you can still plug-in your favorite headphones for a better listening experience. Another thing Google hasn’t changed at all is the lack of any button on the face of the smartphone. Like with the Nexus 6P, the fingerprint scanner is located on the back of the device, within convenient reach of the index finger. Google now calls its the Pixel Imprint, after the Nexus Imprint from last year. It works fast, taking you to the homescreen in an instant. But it also has one other talent. Swiping down on the sensor rolls down the notification shade, letting you take a peek at that growing list of entries. Sadly, that’s all the special talent the Pixel Imprint has. We really have no complaints about the large batteries, 3,450 mAh on the Pixel XL and 2,770 on the Pixel. Both support Qualcomm Quick Charge for fast relief of charging pains. Of course with a compatible fast charger. Sadly, Google still hasn’t figured out how to do wireless charging with these metal phones, a feature that has become absent starting with the Nexus 6P last year. As expected, the Pixel sports a USB-C slot, one that can be used for charging, data, and OTG. In fact, Google ships an OTG cable together with the Pixel. That connector is primarily meant to help fleeing iPhone users to migrate their data over to the Pixel. Sadly, it’s a hit or miss affair, depending on whether you have your iPhone’s data encrypted. At most, you will be able to ferry your photos, music, and videos from the iPhone over to the Pixel. But data like contacts and messages require an unencrypted device. The one area where the Pixel disappoints the most is in water resistance. Google won’t admit it, but it’s graded only IP53, which is barely water resistant at all. While it could survive an accidental shower, depending on how you’re holding it, it won’t survive anything worse. In a day and age where smartphones have become extensions of ourselves, a device that doesn’t offer much assurance might not get much traction either. Wrap-up The Google Pixel represents a new chapter in Google’s smartphone history in more ways than one. Google is trying hard to replicate Apple’s success, even to the point of pricing the Pixel similarly. A 32 GB Pixel XL, for example, costs no less than $769, while 28 GB storage goes for an astounding $869. The Pixel is, of course, cheaper, but only by $120. More than that, however, the Pixel is unabashedly Google’s smartphone. It is clearly no Nexus, in price and in purpose. Whereas the Nexus showcased the best of what the Android operating system has to offer, the Pixel is meant to flaunt Google’s chops in search, cloud storage, and, most especially, machine learning and artificial intelligence. That, in the final analysis, makes the Pixel a harder sell. While it definitely outranks the Nexus in terms of hardware, it requires a commitment to Google’s ecosystem far more than any other OEM has ever required. To put it simply, you need to buy into Google’s spiel, hook, line, and sinker, for the Pixel to make perfect sense. The camera alone, while superb, might not be enough to justify the near $800 price tag. And the design is not exactly something that’s even going to appeal to a wide audience. In the end, the Google Pixel is a smartphone clearly designed by Google, but also clearly designed for those who really believe in Google as well.

Google is now looking to make the process easier by announcing new features for its Flights and hotels search. Starting off with Google Flights, the search tool will soon tell you when the fare for a plane or route you select may increase. The notification which pops up also informs you how much you stand to save if you book the trip before the present amount expires. This could prove to be immensely useful since one of the biggest issues when booking a flight is not knowing when and by how much a price hike will kick in. Google is also planning to show you tips if you’ve set a route but not a specific flight to commute between them. Also Read: Google now fact checks news, expands AMP to all mobile search results These tips include things like suggestions for alternate airports and dates. It’ll also conveniently tell you if there could be a future cost increase based on historical data for that path. For instance, Google may crunch some numbers and tell you that fares might rise in 3 days by about $52. Google further plans to be there for you if you’re not ready to book yet but want to track flights and routes anyway. It’ll send out notifications via email with important data like expected surges and fare expiration. The tool is also getting a new Explore add-on which helps you find places to visit at a particular destination. Google is making hotel searches easier by introducing a new Deals section. The feature informs you when the cost of staying in a hotel is lower than usual. It’ll also showcase whether savings are up for grabs to loyalty members on a hotel’s site. The new changes to the Google Flights website will be rolled out over the next couple of weeks.

SECRETS OF THE INSPIRED TRAVELER Google Just Made It Easier to Book Your Holiday Travel With updates to its Google Flights feature, the search engine giant is looking to corner the travel search market this season. By Bartie Scott Bartie Scott is a reporter for Inc. and an alumna of the University of Tennessee and New York University. She lives in Brooklyn, New York. @bartielouscott Reporter, Inc.@bartielouscott WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Google is doubling down on travel ahead of the holiday season, by rolling out updates to its Google Flights feature over the next few weeks. The service that already allows travelers to view flights from multiple airlines will now track prices, advise on the best time to book and fly based on historical pricing data, and find hotel deals. The new features are meant to help users wrangle all the factors that go into booking a flight--from choosing a destination and the optimal times to purchase and travel. It'll also help you compare prices between airports and airlines and book a hotel. Below is a deeper look at how Google Flights might make your holidays brighter: Search If you're looking at a specific location but haven't yet chosen a flight, Google's improved Search will offer advice--providing tips on days, times and airports that offer the best deal. Once you choose a specific flight, you'll see predictions on whether the price is expected to change--and by how much--to make sure you're getting the best deal. Explore The new Explore feature allows travelers to search based on the type of destination they have in mind. If you are traveling to a certain region, but flexible on the exact location, the Explore feature can search flights based on the best deal or shortest layovers. Hotels Google already flags hotel prices that are above or below the average price, but its new feature will surface all hotels that are currently offering a deal in your desired location. And Google says all of these features are mobile friendly. Throughout the process, you can sign up to track flight and hotel prices via email notifications. Published on: Oct 18, 2016 Advertisement

A notification indicating when the fare is expected to rise and how much they can save on booking might appear next. Notification bar with tips to choose the best price for a specific route may appear if users are looking to book a certain route but haven’t selected a specific airline. “Tips can include things like recommendations for alternate airports or dates,” Naghdy said. Google Flights may also show tips on an expected price jump for that route. Users will need to click on the card to see more details such as how much the price is likely to increase and when.

Additionally, Google Flights will notify users when savings are available to loyalty members on a hotel’s website. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don’t like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 14: Latest News Ahead of special session, Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal yet to accept Cong MLAs’ resignation In complete reversal, President Obama refuses to criticize Donald Trump Poland exhumes president, others killed in 2010 plane crash Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton tell Democrats not to despair Catholic bishops ask Donald Trump for humane immigration policies                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

By Ajay Kumar The Google Pixel XL is a phone with promise. It promises the latest version of Android with guaranteed updates. It promises 24/7 customer support. It promises support for Daydream VR. And it promises a voice assistant to rival Apple's Siri with built-in Google Assistant functionality. Add top-tier hardware to the mix, and you get a winner. Google still needs to deliver on some promises in order to have a five-star product on its hands, but in its current state, the Pixel XL is still one of the best phablets you can buy. It's stands right up there with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the LG V20 as an Editors' Choice. //Compare Similar Products Compare Apple iPhone 7 Plus   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge   %displayPrice%%seller% see it LG V20   %displayPrice%%seller% see it ZTE Axon 7   %displayPrice%%seller% see it OnePlus 3 (Unlocked)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Google Nexus 6P (Unlocked)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Motorola Moto Z Force Droid   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Google Pixel   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Design, Features, and Display You'd be forgiven for mistaking the Pixel XL for an Apple iPhone 7 Plus at first glance, but a number of differences become apparent close up. It has an attractive metal body, distinct antenna lines, and a camera that sits flush on the back. The back has a panel of glass covering the top half, which adds visual interest. We received the Very Silver version of the XL for review, but it's also available in Really Blue and Quite Black. The XL is about the same size as most other new phablets. It measures 6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 5.9 ounces, slightly slimmer and lighter than the iPhone 7 Plus (6.2 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches, 6.6 ounces). You can't use either phone one-handed, so if you want a big screen combined with a (relatively) compact build, your only option is the Galaxy S7 Edge (5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces). Or you might want to check out the smaller Pixel, which is essentially the same exact device as the Pixel XL, but with a smaller 5-inch 1080p display. The Power button is on the right side of the phone, and a volume rocker is right below it. The Power button also launches the camera with a double press. The left side has a SIM card slot. Unlike the S7 Edge and many other Android phones, the Pixel XL lacks a microSD card slot, so you can't expand storage beyond what you get out of the box. The bottom has a USB-C charging port with a speaker and mic on either side. The speaker gets loud, but it's not match for the thunderous front-facing pair on the ZTE Axon 7. On the top you get a 3.5mm audio jack, something you won't find on the latest iPhone. But the Pixel XL lacks waterproofing and wireless charging, two features you'll find in the S7 Edge. View All 12 Photos in Gallery A circular fingerprint scanner sits on the back, and lets you register five fingerprints with Pixel Imprint. The scanner is fast and responsive, though both the 7 Plus and S7 Edge are a bit quicker in waking and unlocking the screen. On the other hand, the Pixel XL's sensor has some extra functionality thanks to motion gestures, letting you do things like swipe down on the scanner itself to show the notification shade. The front of the Pixel XL is dominated by a bright and well-calibrated 5.5-inch 2,560-by-1,440 AMOLED display that offers terrific viewing angles. The screen works out to a crisp 534 pixels per inch (ppi), making it markedly sharper than the Retina display on the iPhone 7 Plus (401ppi) and on par with the screen on the S7 Edge (534ppi). Visibility outdoors is not problem, and while the Pixel's AMOLED panel isn't quite a match for Samsung's in terms of color saturation, it still benefits from true black reproduction by lighting pixels only as necessary. A built-in Night Light feature can automatically change the color temperature of the screen at night to make it easier on your eyes. Left to right: Google Pixel XL, iPhone 7 Plus Network Performance and Connectivity Our Pixel XL review unit is the one sold through Verizon, but it's technically unlocked and has no branding on its body. It supports GSM (850/900/1800/1900), CDMA (800/1900), HSDPA (850/1700(AWS)/1900/2100), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/25/26/28/29/30/41). That means you can use it on every major carrier in the US. We tested it on Verizon, the winner of our most recent Fastest Mobile Network tests, and saw strong network connectivity. We recorded a top download speed of 40Mbps, very good for a highly congested area. In the less-crowded Jersey City, it registered an even more impressive 64Mbps down. The XL also supports Bluetooth 4.2, dual-band Wi-Fi, and NFC. Call quality is a good. Transmissions are clear, with a mild robotic tone that doesn't impact overall clarity. Noise cancellation is strong, but earpiece volume is on the low side. Processor and Battery The Pixel XL is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor clocked at 2.15GHz. It's a more powerful chipset than the Snapdragon 820 you'll find in most high-end Android phones, though most current benchmarks aren't yet optimized to illustrate the difference. In Geekbench, the Pixel XL scored 1,661 single-core and 4,156 multicore, which isn't much different than the Galaxy S7 (1,695/3,955). Both phones were bested by Apple's blazing A10 Fusion processor in the iPhone 7 Plus (3,463/5,612). JetStream benchmarks, which show how the phone handles advanced Web applications, provide a clearer picture. The Pixel XL scored 53.719, higher than the S7 (41.201). The XL has 4GB of RAM, which is on par with most other flagship Android phones. Multitasking is fast and smooth and games like GTA: San Andreas and Asphalt 8 are playable without any dropped frames or latency. The phone does seem to run warmer than others we've tested (including the 5-inch Pixel), with noticeable heat radiating from the glass panel on the back, but it has no impact on performance. See How We Test Cell Phones Battery life on the XL is good, but not spectacular. In our battery rundown test, in which we stream full-screen video over LTE with screen brightness at maximum, the Pixel XL clocked 6 hours and 43 minutes. That's longer than the iPhone 7 Plus (6 hours), but shorter than the stellar 10 hours the S7 Edge managed in the same test. Standby time, however, is fantastic. We charged the phone to full capacity on a Friday night, used it over the weekend without plugging it in, and when Monday rolled around it still had 37 percent left. Fast charging is supported with the included adapter, which lets you charge the phone to 35 percent in 30 minutes, and fully in 1 hour and 30 minutes. There's also a battery saver mode that tamps down screen brightness and restricts background apps to save power. Camera The Pixel's XL's 12.3-megapixel rear-facing camera compares surprisingly favorably with two of the best phone cameras on the market, those on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, despite a lack of optical image stabilization (OIS). Outdoors the XL is a stellar shooter that captures clear, detailed pictures with very little noise or blur. Colors are actually a bit brighter than on the S7, as you can see below. Low-light shooting is also very good, minimizing grain and surpassing the S7 in dimmer settings. The iPhone 7 Plus, on the other hand, does a bit better in low light, favoring denser greens. The set of shots of the Flatiron Building above shows similar performance between the three phones. They all produce clear and detailed pictures, but the XL edges out the S7 in shadow detail, and the iPhone 7 Plus looks just a hair better than the XL. As for zoom, there's no real comparison. With its 2x telephoto zoom lens, the iPhone 7 Plus takes significantly better close-up pictures than the XL and the S7 do with digital zoom. Video can be recorded in 4K at up to 30 frames per second. While the XL may not have OIS, which reduces jittering through the physical adjustment of the camera lens, it does have some of the best electronic image stabilization (EIS) we've tested, which uses software. Walking down a lengthy hallway in the PCMag office while recording, the stabilization on the XL came close to matching that of the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Video recording is smooth when taking a single long shot, but when panning the camera around or turning, there are some artifacts and jerkiness. The front is home to an 8-megapixel camera. It takes clear, reliable selfies, and works well for video chatting in Duo. Software, Google Assistant, and 24/7 Help Along with the Pixel, the Pixel XL is the first phone to ship running Android 7.1 Nougat. The differences become clear as soon as you boot up the phone and look at the home screen, which is markedly different from that of any other Android phone on the market. In some ways it feels like iOS, including the lack of an app drawer. Instead, you swipe up from the bottom to access all your apps. App icons are redesigned to be circular. And the Pixel is first phone with Google Assistant (the company's answer to Siri) built in. It can be accessed a long press of the home button or simply by saying "OK Google." Google Assistant allows for a wide range of tasks including making subscriptions to news or weather updates, adding events to your calendar, playing music, launching apps, sending texts, answering general questions, making phone calls, and navigating with Google Maps. It's not perfect, though. More specific queries will often simply return a generic search result. But since the service is based on machine learning, there's plenty of potential for results to get better over time and future integration with Google Home to look forward to. While you can use Google Assistant on other Android phones through Allo, 24/7 live support is a feature exclusive to the Pixel. We tested this service twice, once right before launch and again a week after. Live chat support via text is accessible and easy to use. The moment we clicked on the Chat button under the Support panel we were told our place in line and connected to a representative within a few minutes. As with most support services, the knowledge and helpfulness of individual representatives can vary. One representative wasn't familiar with a well-known camera lens flare issue, and advised us to factory reset the phone; he also offered a return merchandise authorization and followed up a day later by email. Support via voice is available 24/7, but you're likely to experience a much longer wait time before you get in touch with a representative. In our case, two attempts at contacting phone support over the weekend initially went unanswered, though we did get a follow-up by email a few days later asking if we still wanted a phone call. Still, the live support Google provides for the Pixel XL is far better than you'll get from just about any other phone manufacturer. It's rivaled only by Apple's Genius Bar, but then again, you can't access the Genius Bar from the comfort of your home. In terms of preinstalled apps, the Pixel XL is a pure Google experience. You get Google Launcher, Google Assistant, Google Now, and a full suite of Google apps including Allo, Duo, Google Photos, and many others. For those who buy their phones through Verizon, you'll find three apps preloaded: My Verizon, Message+ , and go90. All three can be uninstalled. Overall, on the 32GB model, you're left with 24.43GB. You get unlimited Google Photo cloud storage photos and videos, but considering the lack of a microSD card slot, most users will want to opt for the 128GB model, which brings your price up to $869. The Pixel's XL bootloader is unlocked, except for the Verizon retail model. That means rooting and installing ROMs is possible; that should allay some fears about Google turning the Pixel into a closed realm. Conclusions At $769 (or $869 if you go with the 128GB model, which you should), the Google Pixel XL is priced to compete with the highest-end phones on the market. And in most regards, it's a success. The Pixel XL represents a combination of powerful hardware, excellent software with the promise of updates, and extensive customer service support. In theory, it's exactly the phone Google needs to compete with Apple. But until Google Assistant or Daydream VR becomes a must-have feature, we can't quite give the Pixel XL a full five stars. Some people will prefer the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge for its waterproof design, expandable storage, wireless charging, and longer battery life. Others will want the LG V20 for its removable battery, "secondary" display, and unrivaled audio performance. But we highly recommend the Pixel XL to any Android user who wants the guarantee of updates and the peace of mind that comes with Google's promised support. That makes it an Editors' Choice.

Strong camera performance. Fast Snapdragon 821 processor. Latest Android 7.1 Nougat software. Promising Google Assistant functionality. 24/7 live help. Unlimited Google Photos storage. Cons No waterproofing, expandable storage, or wireless charging. Bottom Line If you lust after the latest Android software and cool new features in the Google Pixel XL, but are turned off by large phones, the 5-inch Pixel is a superb alternative. By Ajay Kumar The unlocked Google Pixel ($649 for 32GB, $749 for 128GB) is almost identical to its larger sibling, the Pixel XL. The Pixel is a better phone for those who prefer the ergonomic advantages of a 5-inch design, while the 5.5-inch XL tickles the fancies of the phablet crowd. You lose some screen resolution by stepping down in size, but aside from that, the phones are virtually identical in terms of features and performance. Both have top-notch Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processors, the latest Android OS with guaranteed updates, 24/7 live help, and built-in Google Assistant capability. That makes the Pixel one of the best 5-inch Android phones available, and an Editors' Choice along with the Samsung Galaxy S7. //Compare Similar Products Compare Apple iPhone 7   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Samsung Galaxy S7   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Google Nexus 5X (Unlocked)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it LG V20   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Sony Xperia XZ   %displayPrice%%seller% see it ZTE Axon 7   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Huawei Honor 8   %displayPrice%%seller% see it LG G5   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Google Pixel XL   %displayPrice%%seller% see it OnePlus 3 (Unlocked)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Design, Display, and Features The Google Pixel takes many of its design cues from the Apple iPhone 7, including a metal unibody chassis, a bottom-firing speaker, and a rear camera that sits in the upper-right corner. We received the Quite Black Pixel model for review, which is more like a very dark gray, but still looks sleek. It's also available in Really Blue and Very Silver. The Pixel is one of the more reasonably sized Android phones you can get. It measures 5.7 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 5 ounces. The Galaxy S7 is nearly identical, at 5.6 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, but slightly heavier at 5.4 ounces. The 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is smaller and lighter than both at 5.4 by 2.6 by 0.3 inches and 4.9 ounces. Like the larger XL, the back of the Pixel has a pane of glass inlaid in the upper half, with a fingerprint sensor set in the middle. It's a unique design that prevents the Pixel from looking like every other phone out there. With Pixel Imprint you can register up to five fingerprints to unlock the phone, though it seems to take ever-so-slightly longer to wake and unlock compared with the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7. Motion gestures let you swipe down on the fingerprint scanner to access the notifications shade, which is convenient. View All 10 Photos in Gallery You'll find a USB-C charging port on the bottom with a speaker and mic on either side. The Power button and volume rocker are on the right, a SIM card slot is on the left, and a 3.5mm headphone jack is up top. You won't find a microSD card slot, so you're limited to internal storage, as with the iPhone. The phone also lacks waterproofing and wireless charging. If any or all of these features are important to you, your needs will be better met by the Galaxy S7. The Pixel has a 5-inch, 1,920-by-1,080 AMOLED display. It's very bright, and at 441 pixels per inch (ppi) text is crisp and clear. It doesn't quite match the S7's 5.1-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED panel (577ppi), but it's sharper than the iPhone 7's Retina display (326ppi). Colors look accurate, viewing angles are terrific, and using the phone under direct sunlight is no problem. That said, the larger Pixel XL boasts a Quad HD panel with 534ppi, and for the price, it's somewhat disappointing to see the drop in resolution here. Left to right: Google Pixel, Apple iPhone 7 Network Performance and Connectivity We received a Verizon model of the Pixel for review, but it's unlocked and supports bands for use on all US carriers. You have a wide array of GSM (850/900/1800/1900), CDMA (800/1900), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/25/26/28/29/30/41) for solid performance on any service provider. We tested the phone on Verizon, the winner of our Fastest Mobile Networks award for the third year in a row. In Midtown Manhattan the phone delivered strong network performance, with a top download speed of 41Mbps. It also supports dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, and Bluetooth 4.2. Voice calls are good, with clear transmissions through the earpiece and solid noise cancellation for outgoing calls. There's a minor robotic edge to voices, but it doesn't impact overall clarity. Earpiece volume could stand to be a bit louder. Processor, Battery, and Camera Like its larger sibling, the Pixel is powered by a top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor. On Geekbench, which tests CPU performance, it received a single-core score of 1,524 and a multicore score of 4,127, roughly the same as the Pixel XL (1,661/4,136). Those results are similar to those of the Snapdragon 820–powered Galaxy S7 (1,695/3,955), likely because Geekbench hasn't been optimized for the Snapdragon 821 yet. Neither phone is a match for Apple's A10 Fusion-powered iPhone 7, however, which scored 3,490/5,662. The JetStream browser benchmark, which shows how the phone handles advanced Web applications, provides a better picture of the improvement you can expect. The Pixel scored 55.227, significantly higher than the S7's 41.201. The Pixel has 4GB of RAM, which is more than ample for multitasking and gaming. I was able to play graphically demanding games like GTA: San Andreas and Asphalt 8 without any trouble. And unlike the Pixel XL, the Pixel never ran physically warm in testing. See How We Test Cell Phones Battery life is solid. The phone clocked 7 hours and 21 minutes of runtime in our test, in which we set screen brightness to maximum and stream full-screen video over LTE. That's actually better than the larger Pixel XL (6 hours, 43 minutes), likely thanks to the Pixel's lower-resolution display, and roughly 2 hours longer than the iPhone 7 (5 hours, 45 minutes). But the Galaxy S7 bests them all with 9 hours. That said, the Pixel XL showed seriously strong standby time, lasting an entire weekend with power to spare; I suspect the Pixel will be about as good. It also supports fast charging with the included adapter, charging to full in roughly an hour. Camera Camera performance on the Pixel is identical to the XL. Both have a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with laser autofocus. We tested the Pixel against the iPhone 7 Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S7, two of the best smartphone cameras available. All shots were taken with Auto mode and no other adjustments. Overall camera performance is excellent. In well-lit situations, such as our shots of the Flatiron Building and a flower bed above, the Pixel captures clear, detailed images, favoring brighter colors a bit more than the S7 and matching the iPhone 7 Plus in overall clarity and detail capture. In lower light it also does well, beating out the S7 in capturing details in areas with shadows or darkness, as our shot of a statue below illustrates. The Pixel's rear camera is capable of recording 4K video at 30fps and 1080p at 60fps. In both cases, video is smooth and stable, assisted by the excellent electronic image stabilization (EIS). We tested the EIS by walking the length of a hallway in PCMag's office with the Pixel, and then compared the results against those of the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, both of which use optical image stabilization (OIS). The Pixel has excellent stabilization for a device that uses software-based rather than physical lens adjustments, but naturally, the S7 and iPhone 7 were more stable when it came to panning around. The Pixel tends to jitter and lose focus during turns. The 8-megapixel front-facing camera takes good, clear shots in most circumstances. It also allows for solid video chats via Duo. Software, Google Assistant, and 24/7 Help The Pixel ships with Android 7.1 Nougat, a version of the operating system that is not yet available on any other phone. It brings some significant changes, including an app screen that's been removed from the home screen and can only be accessed by swiping up, and some less significant ones, like circular app icons. And Google promises to deliver software updates to the phone, which is a heck of a lot better than you can expect with many other Android devices. The Pixel is a marked departure from Nexus phones like the 6P and 5X. It's the first phone with Google Assistant built in, which is essentially the company's version of Siri. You can call it up by holding down the Home button or by simply saying "OK Google," and use voice commands to carry out various tasks such as receiving weather updates, making phone calls, and adding events to your calendar. Replies aren't perfect, though, and certain queries will just return a Google search result. It uses machine learning, so we expect it will get better over time, especially when it integrates with Google Home. Non-Pixel users can still access Google Assistant through Allo, but having it built in is definitely a plus. The other big selling point of the Pixel is 24/7 live support. Accessed through the Support tab in the Settings menu, it allows you to text with or request a phone call from a Google support representative. We tested this service twice, before launch and a week after. Text chat works best in terms of accessibility. We were quickly connected with a support representative after a brief wait. Support quality varied from person to person, but all were eager to assist and one even followed up by email and offered a return merchandise authorization to make sure our issue was resolved. Phone support is available 24/7, but our experience here wasn't as smooth. Wait times in getting a call back are longer, and two attempts made to contact phone support over the weekend seemed to go unanswered, though a representative did follow up later by email. Still, the live support Google offers with the Pixel is significantly better than anything you'll get from nearly any other phone manufacturer. It's next in line behind Apple's Genius Bar, which you definitely can't access from your own home. The phone has an unlockable bootloader (except for the Verizon retail model), which means you can root the phone and install ROMs. In terms of the software load, you'll find the standard set of Google apps, along with three bloatware apps—My Verizon, Message+, and go90—which can thankfully be uninstalled. (If you buy the Pixel directly from Google you won't have these preloaded.) You're left with 25.11GB of available storage out of a total of 32GB. That's on the low side, but you get free unlimited storage for photos and video with Google Photos, which helps. Still, given the absence of a microSD card, we advise you pay the extra $100 for the 128GB version, which brings your total up to $749. Conclusions Overall, the Google Pixel is one of a handful of reasonably sized Android phones that, because of its hardware, can compete with flagship phablets. That makes sense, because at $649-$749, it's priced right in line with those high-end models. If software is of paramount importance to you, no other Android phone on the market can match the Pixel. If you're more interested in hardware, the Samsung Galaxy S7 is the phone to get. It has a higher resolution display, a waterproof design, expandable storage, and longer battery life. Both phones fulfill different needs, and are equally worthy of our Editors' Choice. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

In light of how mature the smartphone market has become in the last few years, it’s hard for a new phone to stand out as something that takes anything more than a few baby steps forward. This phone isn’t that much different. But what is different is that it isn’t just any Android phone made by one of Google’s partners. This one is Google’s, and that’s special. It’s special because Google really has made an effort at building a good top-to-bottom user experience. It’s special because Google has made some clear — in some cases major — improvements to its software and how it works with the hardware. It’s special because it has a great camera. It’s special because it’s the first Android phone to ship with the Google Assistant. It’s special because it’s the first Daydream-ready smartphone. It’s special because it’s the best portal to Google’s services, full stop. But most of all, I think the Pixel is special because it seems to me that Google’s newly-rebirthed smartphone line has a lot of potential. Yes, there are some things that this phone doesn’t have. But what phone doesn’t? Let’s talk about what the Pixel has going for it. SO WHAT IS THE PIXEL? The Pixel is a new smartphone, and as the company says, it’s #madebyGoogle. It’s the spiritual successor to the Nexus line of old, but with at least one key external difference: there’s no co-branding from another manufacturer. We know that the device was actually manufactured by HTC, but Google is truly claiming this phone as their own. In its marketing, Google is positioning the phone as “Phone by Google” to make sure this is clear. This is Google’s baby. The Pixel has a 5-inch FHD AMOLED display, and the Pixel XL has a slightly larger 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display, but other than that they’re mostly the same. You’ll find a quad-core 64-bit Snapdragon 821 SoC, 4GB of RAM, 12.3MP and 8MP cameras, 32GB of storage, and the usual Bluetooth, NFC, and other connectivity interfaces. The Pixel has a 2,770 mAh battery, while the XL has a 3,450mAh battery. But battery life expectancy is not much different between them — the Pixel XL is a little better. Unfortunately, we didn’t get a review unit for the standard Pixel yet, so this review is solely of the Pixel XL. That shouldn’t matter much, though, because as I just mentioned, the only differences between the two phones are battery life and their display sizes/resolutions. The experience you actually receive with both phones should be nearly identical with the exception of size, because unlike the tricks Apple is pulling with the iPhone 7 Plus, Google isn’t packing any special features in XL to get you to upgrade. It is truly a matter of size preference with the Pixel, and little more. HARDWARE BUILD | The Google Pixel doesn’t exactly have the most stunning a smartphone has ever had, but it’s definitely not bad. It’s going to draw comparisons to its competitors, though — that’s for sure. First, the phone will almost certainly be compared to the iPhone thanks to its antenna lines and large top-and-bottom front bezels. That bottom bezel, sans a home button like the iPhone, is probably the most unsightly part of the Pixel. It’s just a huge chin. The other comparison that this phone will likely draw is to HTC phones, and for good reason. Forget the fact that the antenna line design that many will say the Pixel copies from the iPhone was actually first introduced by HTC. The phone bears some resemblance to the HTC 10, with its sharp edges and side bezels. While it’s definitely not a “copy” by any means, the Pixel does feel a lot like a mix between the iPhone 6S and the HTC 10. It doesn’t have a standout design like the Galaxy S7 edge. Glass back But it does have one hardware design feature that’s completely unique. The back of the phone is actually one third glass, fused together with the rest of the aluminum unibody. While there’s little or no functional purpose to this (Google says it serves to even further improve cellular reception), it does do a good job of giving the Pixel its own outer appearance. If you see a phone with a glass-backed top third like this, it’s guaranteed to be a Pixel (at least for now). And that’s good for Google. Pixel Imprint Sitting atop this glass back is the what was previously known as Nexus Imprint. “Pixel Imprint” is really just the fancy name for the Pixel’s fingerprint scanner. There’s nothing particularly interesting here, but I have to say I’m a huge fan of the smooth glass rear fingerprint sensors. They feel really nice and — at least in my experience — I tend to find them a bit faster and more accurate than others. But that’s not saying much in 2016, because pretty much all phones have lightning fast fingerprint sensors. Size and feel in the hand Like I said, I’ve only really had my hands on the Pixel Xl, so I can’t really comment on the smaller model. But in size, I think the Pixel XL hits a sweet spot for me. Phones like the iPhone 6S Plus or the Huawei Nexus 6P have always been a bit on the big side for me, and the size of the standard iPhone or the Nexus 5X is a bit small. The Pixel XL manages to pack a 5.5-inch display in a body that’s smaller than the iPhone 6S Plus, and that’s a plus for me. But it’s no Galaxy S7 edge, which manages to pack that display in an even smaller form factor. The Pixel XL feels really good in the hand. It has nicely curved edges on the backside, so it feels a lot more like an iPhone and less like the sharper-edged Galaxy devices from Samsung or the HTC 10. I prefer that, but as I said, this phone is probably more vulnerable than any of the entire history of Nexus phones to be compared to the iPhone. I don’t mind that personally, but it’s just the reality of things. There’s a headphone jack! It’s kind of sad that I have to even mention this, but if this is a deciding factor for you, you’ll be glad to hear that the Pixel has a nice headphone jack located right at the top-left side. Personally this wasn’t a big deal to me, and I haven’t really had much problem using an adapter when necessary with the Moto Z, but I understand that this is a deal-breaker for some. I hope that changes soon, because in my humble opinion, it’s about time we move on from the 3.5mm jack. But it’s there if you need it! Good displays While the Pixel doesn’t have the best screens on a smartphone, they’re adequate or better than adequate. And I think you may find this to be a theme throughout this review. In many aspects, the Pixel is “safe” in terms of hardware. Like many phones, it’s not the best in direct sunlight, but this phone gets brighter than the Moto Z for example. It’s more than enough to get the job done, though. I was happy with the colors and vibrance of the display when watching videos and playing games. Fast charging The Pixel has great fast charging. Google says that it can get up to 7 hours of use from only 15 minutes of charging on both the Pixel and Pixel XL, and can attest to this. In fact, I woke up at 7 AM one morning and the phone was completely dead from the night before. I had to be out the house at 8 AM. I plugged in the phone and gave it about a half hour of juice, and that charge got me through the whole day. Speaker & microphones The main earpiece speaker is nice and crisp on the Pixel XL, and I couldn’t ask for more in terms of call quality. But with phones like the iPhone 7 and other Android phones having had stereo speakers for years, it feels like a bit of a downgrade to go to a single bottom-firing mono speaker with the Google Pixel. This is something that’s kind of nitpicky to me (but might be important to you!), but it’s nonetheless unfortunate considering the phone’s price point. But that one speaker sounds fine. I know that this review is full of Galaxy S7 edge comparisons (I apologize, I just think it’s a good benchmark since it’s one of the most popular and best Android phones of the year), but this is yet another case where I would put the two phones about on par with each other. If you have an S7 edge laying around (or you have a friend with one), just try playing music through its single speaker. That’s about what you’re getting with the Pixel. Vibration motor This is just an exercise I like to do every time I review a phone, so bear with me. I’ve found a hobby in obsessing over the vibration motors of phones, and there are some clear winners and losers in the smartphone realm. The clear undefeated champion when it comes to vibration motors — and I say this unapologetically — is the iPhone 7, which barely beats the iPhone 6S. Clear losers include the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, so I think I was justifiably nervous about how this phone would turn out. Thankfully, I’m glad to report that the Pixel has turned out just fine in this area. The motor is no Taptic Engine by any means, but it’s nice and precise and doesn’t produce any audible buzzing when you tap buttons. It’s still pretty weak, but it’s about average compared to other Android phones like the Galaxy S7 edge. It’s not waterproof One of the biggest downsides of this phone’s hardware is that it’s just not waterproof. That’s something that is becoming more and more expected lately at this price point, but you’re sadly not going to find it here. In fact, the Pixel is rated IP53 for dust and water resistance, so that means it’s pretty well dust resistant, but it’s only going to be able to take a splash or two of water before some amount of damage is done. In the coming days we’ll probably see lots of water dunk tests done on the phone, so stay tuned as we find out exactly how water resistant it is compared to other Android phones. SOFTWARE | I’ve long been a fan of “stock” Android, so I’m more than ecstatic to be able to talk about the Google Pixel’s software. I almost always have to list “crappy customized OEM ROM” in the list of downsides when I review Android phones, but I’m glad to say that the Google Pixel is one of only a few exceptions of the year. Yes, 3rd party Android customizations have gotten better in recent years, but they still almost always find a way to get on my nerves. Not so with the Pixel. Its UI is fantastic. Google Assistant The big software selling point for the Pixel — at least for now — is the inclusion of the Google Assistant as a baked in feature on the OS level. It’s still unknown when — if ever — older Nexus devices will have the same integration, so Pixel seems like it will be the only way to get this feature for a while. Replacing the hollow home, multitasking, and back navigation icons of previous versions, the Pixel goes with solid white and the middle one is even more special. Tap and hold it to get some dancing colored bubbles. But tapping and holding it does more than just give you an undeniably-Googley animation. This gesture invokes the Google Assistant, which is basically the voice features we’re all familiar with from Google Now with a far more intelligent and personal helper built on top. Think Apple’s Siri, but Assistant — in my experience — has far better word recognition and accuracy. And of course Google Assistant is powered by Google, so it has access to all kinds of information that Siri might not be able to grab for you. The big thing with Assistant in comparison to Google Now, though, is that is has much deeper control over your phone and it can help you in much more intelligent ways. Assistant can play your news (from your selected sources of course), you can get a summary of your upcoming day, it can learn things about you (try telling it your favorite color!), it can play games with you, and more. You can also tell Google Assistant to do things that you’re familiar with from using Google Now.  You can use it manage your shopping list in Google Keep, you can use it make a phone call you can use it to control Google Play Music (and soon other services), you can use it to control your phone’s flashlight, and of course you can get smart answers from Google. Also of note, is that the Google Now on Tap features are still present with Assistant. Simply tap and hold and then scroll down. Allo and Duo Unsurprisingly, Google is using the Pixel and Pixel XL to push its newly-launched duo of messaging apps, Allo and Duo.  The phone also ships with both pre-installed, and disables Hangouts by default for most users. If you’re a Project Fi user, the phone will detect that you — obviously — need Hangouts when you first set up the phone and won’t disable it. Adding to the awesome software features of the Pixel, Google is throwing in unlimited full resolution storage of videos and photos in Google Photos. Pixel Launcher One big thing to note here is the Pixel Launcher, which is landing officially for the first time on the Pixel and Pixel XL. It’s an evolution of the long-popular Google Now Launcher (which I’m a big fan of in the first place), and adds some useful features and tweaks. The most obvious is a permanent weather and time widget on the home screen, but the new launcher also has a new app drawer, an easy-to-use Google button in the top-left, and some visual tweaks to make the Pixel unique. Circular icons The most obvious visual tweak that comes hand in hand with the Pixel launcher, is that almost all of Google’s stock applications come with a set of stylized circular icons on the Pixel. It’s a common misconception that this is part of the Pixel Launcher itself (the rounded icons will stick around no matter which launcher you use), but of course using a third-party launcher will allow you to apply icon packs to make them look however you want. Personally, I haven’t decided whether or not I like the new icons. When I first saw them in the leaked images of the Pixel home screen, I had a knee jerk negative reaction, but I have to say that they’ve grown on me in the last several days. Uniformity in size and design is a good thing, I think, but my biggest complaint is that despite Google’s best efforts there’s still inconsistencies. A few of Google’s own apps still don’t have circular icons — Allo, Duo and Keep to name a few — and apps that you download from the Play Store aren’t just going to be automatically re-themed to look good alongside Google’s circular icon set. Another thing that bugs me is Google’s inconsistency with the circular icons. Some of them — like Maps and Calculator — fill the whole circle, while others look oddly empty surrounded with whiteness. Would be nice if Google would commit one way or the other. Google Photos Google Photos isn’t new of course, but the Pixel — as was long expected — ships with some extra Google Photos goodness beyond how great the app already is. Instead of taking up Google Drive space, photos and videos taken with the Pixel will be added to your Google Photos app in their full resolution for free. It’s unlimited full-resolution storage and backup for all of your photos and videos (even videos in 4K!). That’s unprecedented and alone is a pretty compelling selling point for the Pixel. “Moves” There’s a new section in the Settings app called “Moves,” which includes some quick gestures for accessing functions of your phone. Currently the section has three options, including “Jump to camera” for double tapping the power button to open the camera, and “Flip camera” for switching between front-facing and rear-facing camera with the flick of a wrist. The most notable option, though, is the “Swipe for notifications” option which lets you swipe down on the fingerprint sensor to pull down the notification shade. You might remember this feature from the Honor 8 and other Huawei phones. Daydream-ready! Another huge software upside with the Pixel and Pixel XL is that they are the first Daydream-ready Android phones. This doesn’t mean much yet, because Google’s Daydream View headset hasn’t even shipped yet (we’ll be getting ours for review soon!), but it’s a big plus if you see that as something that you might be interested in later this year. I tried out Daydream at the Google event on October 4th, and I was impressed to say the least. It’s a nice middle ground between PSVR and Cardboard. Google Support Another great software addition with the Pixel and Pixel XL is a new Support tab in the Settings app. If you ever run into any problems with your Pixel, Google has added the ability to quickly contact support via a phone call or a chat. While that might be a deciding feature for enthusiasts, I could see the average smartphone user being enticed by this. It’s definitely nice to have support on call if you ever need it. Wallpapers Another addition that might go unnoticed by some is the wide selection of some great high-quality wallpapers on the Pixel and Pixel XL. Of course you can choose from your own photos, but there are also “Live Earth” wallpapers of different locations around the world that move as you interact with your phone, “Live data” wallpapers that change based on the time or weather conditions, and some galleries of other high-quality images that are built in. You can also turn on a “daily wallpaper” that changes every day. Overall, these are solid improvements, and keep your phone feeling fresh. PERFORMANCE | Benchmarks I’m not a huge fan of benchmarks, because I don’t think they very well capture how well a phone performs in real life. But I think it’s worth noting that the Google Pixel XL has landed — at least based on my tests — as one of the most powerful phones ever analyzed by Geekbench. In single core, it was only consistently beaten by the Galaxy S7 edge, the Galaxy S7, and the Xiaomi Mi 5. In multi-core, it was only consistently beaten by the Galaxy S7 edge, the Galaxy S7, and the Galaxy Note 7. Camera performance One of my biggest praises of the Pixel and Pixel XL is the camera app’s performance. The Nexus devices were long plagued with low-quality cameras and bad camera performance, and Google has basically fixed these problems completely with the Pixel. In fact, the camera might be my favorite part of the phone. It’s super fast, there’s no lag, and the viewfinder consistently pops up in 1 or 2 seconds flat. And that brings us to the cameras themselves, which are also impressive to say the least… CAMERAS | When Google announced the Pixel, the company claimed that it has the best camera on a smartphone, at least according to the latest DxOMark scores. As of the time of this review, the Google Pixel has beaten the HTC 10, the Galaxy S7 edge, the Sony Xperia X Performance, the Moto Z, and the iPhone 7 to name a few. It’s worth noting that the iPhone 7 Plus has yet to be reviewed by DxOMark, but the Pixel nonetheless should be a step up compared to all of the other Android flagships. Is it? Check out the following photos, but please understand that I’m not a photographer by any means. I would take these as an example of what the average person would be taking with the Pixel on a daily basis, not as some of the best that the Pixel can take: Well, we don’t have every single Android phone on hand to compare it to, but we do have a Galaxy S7 edge, one of the next -best Android phones according to DxO. Based on my initial impressions over the last few days, DxO’s benchmark holds up pretty well. The Pixel does indeed have one of the best cameras I’ve ever used on a smartphone — based purely on looking at the photos. But as someone who isn’t really picky about their photos in the first place, I’d be fine with the Galaxy S7. EIS is the new OIS (almost) One thing that I have to rave about is this phone’s EIS when recording video. The lack of OIS on this phone was one of the biggest “don’t knock it ’til you try” moments I’ve had in my many few years of reviewing phones. The lack of OIS was one of the biggest “really, Google?” moments for me at the October 4th announcement event, but I have been proven so wrong. The EIS that Google is packing on this phone is borderline magic in my opinion — I think it even beats hardware OIS in some cases. CONCLUSION | Switching to Pixel If you’re on the fence about making the switch because switching from the “other side” (read: an iPhone) sounds difficult, Google has you covered. The Pixel comes with an OTG dongle, which might sound unfamiliar, but it’s just a little adapter used for plugging in your other phone directly to the Pixel. If you’re coming from an iPhone, you can just plug it straight into your new phone and Google will walk you through moving over all your data when you first set up the phone. Live Cases Another interesting tidbit that is worth mentioning is that Google offers some really nice first-party cases to go with your Pixel or Pixel XL. They’ve been around since around the time of the launch of the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, and let you customize your phone and make it your own. You can create a Live Case with a Google Maps silhouette of your favorite place, you can create a case using a photo you upload, or you can pick from a pre-selected gallery of art. These cases aren’t cheap, but — on top of being customizable — they also add functionality to your phone with an extra button on the back. Value This is a Google-made package from top to bottom, and yeah, it has its compromises, but it very well could be the start of something great. That’s what I think is so special about it. The idea of what Google might be able to accomplish going forward is exciting, and the Pixel is a glimpse at a future where Google’s own hardware competes with the Samsungs and Apples of the world — and maybe even wins. Sadly, though, the package you get with the Pixel comes at a cost. The standard Pixel starts at $650, and the Pixel XL starts at $769. You can get financing through either Verizon or the Google Store, but these phones are unlocked and will work with most major carriers. At these prices, the phones aren’t a no brainer. But I also don’t think it’s an outrageous asking price either — especially if you manage to get one of those limited edition blue models and you get affordable cellular service through Project Fi. The elephant(s) in the room, I think, are the Chinese-made budget offerings like the OnePlus 3. In terms of raw specifications, the OnePlus 3 is very comparable to the Pixel — and in some ways better. It’s also a whole 2 or 3 Benjamins cheaper. Honestly, it’s a difficult situation. The Pixel really is great. And in some ways it’s one of the best phones ever. Early — and perhaps exclusive — access to Google’s latest software features is hard to pass up for some. It has near-stock Android with valuable software additions on top and reliable performance. It has the Snapdragon 821. But is it worth the extra cash? I can’t answer that question for you. I think for me, the answer is yes. I would pick this phone over most Android phones. But I’m also a big fan of Google software, and I prefer to use Android the way Google intends it. None of the other OEMs can offer this flavor of Android that has this degree of Google’s mark and influence. All things considered, these phones aren’t perfect. But no phones are, and if you’re one who loves Google’s software and services as much as I do, they might be the imperfect phones for you.

And making the most of it, Google is rolling out text messaging service for AdWords ads. Google has been testing click-to-text in AdWords search ads for several months now. While call extensions have been around for years, the new message extensions give users another option to connect with businesses. “In the coming weeks, we’re introducing click-to-message ads to bring the efficiency and effectiveness of messaging to search ads. By setting up a message extension, you’ll give users an easy way to text you to start a conversation and continue it whenever is most convenient for them,” Google said in a blog post on Monday. The feature lets developers add a text button to ads with pre-populated messages. The icon shows up next to the main ad in Google Search. When users click on a message extension or icon, their phone’s SMS app will launch automatically. Message extensions can also be scheduled for certain time or dates. There is also a provision to use auto-responders for developers. Businesses will require having their phone numbers to receive and send text messages. The Google blog post also mentioned the existing AdWords feature users, which include TravelPASS group, AnyVan, Auto & General and Global Industrial. “Click-to-message ads have proven to be a great way to help prequalified customers start the hotel reservation process in a way that is convenient and easy for them. It’s a seamless and streamlined process that helps increase brand trust. The conversion rate on message extensions is 41% higher compared to other ad extensions,” said Gabe Thayn, director of search marketing, TravelPASS Group in the blog post. Gavin Parker, paid search manager, Auto & General, said: “The results from click-to-message have been phenomenal and we’ve seen an 80% higher conversion rate when compared to other similar channels. We can now tap into an important consumer base that prefers to use SMS to learn more about our insurance products.” Message extensions will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks. Google has also released a best practices guide for advertisers to get started with message extensions. Like this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

Software (and Lasers) Kelsey McClellan for WIRED The Google Pixel is the best smartphone you can buy, thanks in part to its killer camera. But its photo smarts go beyond the specs. Like many of Google’s greatest hits, the magic’s in the algorithms. The Pixel offers compelling evidence that phones haven’t just replaced point-and-shoot cameras. They’ve perfected the concept. Smartphone cameras are smarter, faster, and they’re always in your pocket. Even better, they can improve your shots even after you’ve taken them. Automatic For the People According to independent analysis from DxO Mark, the Pixel and Pixel XL feature the best smartphone cameras yet—despite having specs that, while competitive, don’t scream “Best Camera Ever.” What makes the Pixel camera so good is you don’t have to think about it. And it’s fast. You just point, shoot, and let the Pixel do its thing. Pixel’s marquee mode, dubbed HDR+, captures several images in rapid sequence, analyzes their attributes, works some tone-mapping magic, and creates a single optimized image. It’s the default auto mode, and how DxO evaluated the camera. Another cool feature, Smart Burst, analyzes up to 30 frames per second as you’re shooting, captures the 10 best images based on color balance, blur, and even facial expressions, and marks the shots in your gallery that it considers best.1 It’s often right. Pixel Perfect Review: Google Pixel Google Pixel Upends the Android Universe All That New Google Hardware? It’s a Trojan Horse for AI Daydream View Is Google’s Plushy VR Headset for the Masses The previous generation Nexus smartphones, the 5X and 6P, offered HDR+ and Smart Burst. The big difference here is Google could “control the entire stack,” according to the Pixel team. “It’s something we’ve been working on for a few years in terms of building up the expertise and intellectual property,” says Android VP of Engineering Dave Burke, who says the camera team worked closely with the Google Photos team on the capture and post-capture pipeline. It shows. Sensor Surprise It helps that Google didn’t skimp on components. The 12-megapixel sensor is from Sony, the global market leader for CMOS image sensors. Everything from iPhones to drones to Nikon DSLRs and, of course, Sony’s excellent cameras uses a Sony sensor. The Pixel features the state-of-the-art model, the IMX378 sensor. The only other phone to offer it is Xiaomi’s Mi 5S. The sensor’s photosites—the buckets that receive photons through the lens—are big for a smartphone. Aided by the Pixel’s wide aperture f/2.0 lens, they sponge up more light, making the phone more adept in dark conditions. But low-light photography is just one way Google squeezes the most out of the sensor’s bigger pixels. The larger light receptacles also help stabilize photos; because they’re more efficient at gathering light, the phone can use faster shutter speeds. “We’re keeping exposure time short,” says Android camera engineering manager Tim Knight. “The strategy is to take multiple frames at short exposure times and then fuse them together with some clever software. That gives a similar quality to one image with a really long exposure time. It’s not just that you’re eliminating blur, you’re also better capturing moving subjects in the scene.” Google Keeping It Stable Software also helps overcome a perceived Pixel camera deficiency. It lacks optical image stabilization, a headline feature for flagships like the Galaxy S7 lineup and iPhone 7. “With larger pixels, you don’t need OIS as much,” says Knight. He says several things about the camera help stabilize images without OIS: pixel size, faster shutter speeds, and algorithmic analysis of burst-mode frames based on the “lucky imaging” principles of astrophotography. But in video mode, the Google team thinks it has come up with a better form of stabilization. It’s driven by the phone’s gyroscope. You can jostle the phone while you’re recording video, and the Pixel’s stabilization is evident on the screen. The system samples readings from the gyroscope 200 times per second, then corrects shake as you’re shooting. “We have a physical wire between the camera module and the hub for the accelerometer, the gyro, and the motion sensors,” Knight explains. “That makes it possible to have very accurate time-sensing and synchronization between the camera and the gyro.” Lasers and Beyond The interplay of sturdy hardware and smart software doesn’t stop there. “The premise that you should use a burst of shots for everything is a principle that we hold strongly,” says Burke. “There’s a post-processing step where it’s working with the shot, and we’ve sped that up in the Pixel phones with accelerated digital signal processing and post-processing.” With all that need for speed, perhaps the biggest advantage of the IMX378 sensor is what’s fused onto the back of it. The sensor uses Sony’s latest “stacked” design, with a DRAM chip attached to its back. That helps move image data off the sensor quickly, where Google’s post-processing tricks can go to work. The peppy quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, a powerful GPU, and 4 gigs of RAM help Pixel work fast. Google designed the Pixel for the everyperson. Each shot in a burst mode sequence normally looks sharp, thanks to phase-detection autofocus built into the sensor. Compared to contrast-detection autofocus, which is common in standalone cameras, phase-detection AF is often much faster. It’s more effective at locking focus on objects approaching or retreating from the camera. In the same situations, contrast-detection systems need to “search” in and out with the lens. But phase-detection relies on having lots of light to work with, making it a bad match for the Pixel’s low-light prowess. So of course, Google augmented it with a secondary system that uses lasers. “If you look on the back, you’ll see two little holes next to the microphone,” says Knight. “One is a laser emitter, and one is a laser receiver. It sends out a cone of IR light which reflects off the subject and bounces back. It’s a time-of-flight laser, which means it uses the phase of the receive light to very accurately figure out how far away the subject is.” Unlike the iPhone 7 Plus, Google’s approach to the Pixel camera involves more rapid-fire photos rather than more lenses. That may disappoint pro-grade photographers, as might all the processing that makes photos better described as good than accurate. But that’s not the target audience. Google designed the Pixel for the everyperson, while the Nexus lineup was characteristically different. The design team even worked on removing the “camera bump” on Nexus phones in order to make the phone more approachable. Instead, the Pixel phones have a wedge-like slope that is thicker near the camera module. “The Nexus 6P, it looks kind of technical,” says Burke. “We wanted a broader appeal.” Although the Pixel launched at the top of the phone-photography pack, it’s clear that the team behind the camera has further innovation in mind. Burke and Knight repeatedly referred to the Pixel simply as “this year’s camera,” with sights squarely on what’s coming next. How do you beat the best? With hard work, great components, and lasers, sure. But also with better algorithms. 1UPDATE 10/19/2016 12:00 PM ET: This story has been updated to correct a description of Smart Burst. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Smart Burst mode captures up to 30 images per second. Smart Burst analyzes 30 frames per second, then captures the 10 “best” images in the sequence based on the phone’s algorithmic analysis. Go Back to Top.

(Image: News18.com) One of the major highlight of the latest Google Pixel smartphones is Google Assistant, a voice-based personal assistant like Apple’s Siri. For someone spending at least Rs 57,000 on a pure Android Pixel smartphone, this is Google’s exclusive gift. But what if this USP is already available in every Android smartphone in the form of Google Now? Of course, Google Now and Google Assistant are two separate names. However, brace yourself for a little surprise. If you compare “Ok Google” results on any other Android smartphone and compare it with the new Pixel smartphones, you would be amazed to find that both are exactly the same. Initially, there is nothing much extra that Google Assistant can do which the regular Google Now can’t. At an instant you will think that Google Assistant is simply a repackaged edition of Google Now, common to every Android handset. But before pushing it aside, note that the Google Assistant is the next level of Google Now. It integrates deeper artificial intelligence and is meant to provide easy access to whatever you need through voice and make conversing with the AI voice more personal. However, Indian accents are still not supported and might be a bit irritating sometimes. After using the Google Assistant on both Allo chat app and Pixel smartphones. Here is a comparison between Google Now and Google Assistant. Should you wait? Several reports are already teaching enthusiasts to get Google Assistant by rooting their Android phones running Android Nougat. While there is no guarantee whether it will be a smooth ride or not, you will definitely have to forget the device warranty. Also, if you are not sure about being an amateur coder, it is always better to try Assistant on Google Allo chat app. It is available for free and will work with older Android phones not running Android Nougat. This is because, after all the hard work, you might not be impressed much, especially, if you use Google Now on your phone regularly. What’s New in Google Assistant? Apart from the experience, both Google Assistant and Google Now have got the same help on offer. While Google Now is more web-based, the new Assistant is perfectly blended on the Pixel and seems like a default hardware feature. So, the results appear faster and are more accurate. What can be done with both Google Now and Assistant? If you haven’t used Google Now then just tap-and-hold the home button or swipe the mic icon on the lock button to activate it. Now, speak to your phone to perform these: -Make a call or send an SMS -Open apps -Install apps -Play music -Set alarm/ reminders -Get weather/ news/ sports news -Find tickets or restaurants -Navigate The same can be done on Google Assistant as well. However, staying true to the cause, you can only speak to the Google Assistant on the Pixel smartphones, you can’t type commands like in Google Now or Allo. Active Google Now users will feel the difference Active Google Now users will feel the real change. Google Assistant is friendlier and you can manage to have a conversation with the AI voice. If you aren’t familiar with Google Now yet, then the differences will be unconvincing. Google Assistant will constantly learn about you and will improve itself overtime, provided you continue using it and that’s where it’s advantage lies.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google Pixel review roundup: The most polarizing phone of 2016 Zach Epstein BGR NewsOctober 18, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share The reviews are in and to say opinions are split could be the understatement of the year. Most smartphones see first-run reviews that are generally pretty similar across the board; bloggers and technology journalists either like a phone for the most part, or dislike a phone for the most part. In the case of Google's new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones though, early reviews appear to be on opposite ends of the spectrum — gadget reviewers either really like Google's first self-designed smartphones or the really, really dislike the phones. Google's new Android 7.1 Nougat software offers plenty of great features and Google Assistant is also well-liked thus far. That leaves the Pixel and Pixel XL's hardware as the only real question, so let's see what early reviews had to say. MUST READ: A month with the iPhone 7 Engadget Engadget called the design "yawn-inducing," but was among the more timid sites when discussing the phones' design. After years of experimenting with Nexus devices, Google finally decided it wanted to make a phone of its own. HTC might be assembling the phones, but Google designed and developed the Pixel from end-to-end. In doing so, it crafted a truly great smartphone that sadly looks a little dull. Still, the inclusion of a speedy new Snapdragon 821 chipset and a fantastic camera make the smaller Pixel a device to be reckoned with. Now, if only it were a little cheaper. Read the full review. Gizmodo Gizmodo, as usual, was less gentle in its assessment of Google's design. The site called Google's Pixel and Pixel XL "too dumb and ugly to replace your iPhone." Apart from issues with the design, Gizmodo wasn't always impressed with Google Assistant either. I was particularly disappointed with Google Assistant because it’s such a promising concept. Google is moving attention away from the search bar more than ever. Instead, the company wants you to “Google” by using the messaging app Allo or voice search in Google Assistant. Ultimately, the Pixel and Pixel XL are gateways for feeding the Google brain more information about yourself. As Google’s AI gets smarter, the Assistant will become more helpful. While some people might find this creepy, I think the idea is exciting, and it’s a letdown that the tech isn’t there yet. Read the full review. The New York Times Remember how much Google hyped up its camera during the Pixel unveiling. Well NYT called it "mediocre." Like pretty much every handset maker, Google proclaims Pixel’s camera to be the best on the market. Its rear camera has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, similar to the iPhone 7’s 12-megapixel sensor. So I took photos with the Pixel and compared them with shots taken with the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7. All the cameras took clear, visually appealing photographs with rich details, but there were major differences in color, even without any filters applied. The photos taken with the Pixel looked colder — they appeared to exaggerate cyans and magentas. The ones taken with the iPhone looked more vivid, though they appeared to slightly bump up yellows to make photos look warmer. The color in pictures taken with the Samsung phone looked oversaturated and unnatural. Read the full review. Ars Technica Ars Technica called Google's hardware "uninspired," but had plenty of nice things to say about the software. The Pixels' aluminum unibody design does make them feel like products that belong in the $650-$750 range. Things get a little strange on the back, though, where another Gorilla Glass 4 panel at the top of the phone surrounds the rear camera and fingerprint reader. The glass panel is the device's unique design decision, but adding more glass to a phone isn't necessarily a positive. While the two-thirds metal back is easily superior to an all-glass Samsung phone, it's a step below the all-metal backs you'd get from Apple or HTC. It's not clear what the reason is for the glass back panel, either. It might let signals in and out of the device—but the bottom of the phone still has antenna lines. And there's no wireless charging or other features that might obviously justify the need for more glass. The design screams for attention, since the glass is never the same color as the surrounding metal, but at least there's no camera bump. The back is totally flat, allowing the phone to sit on a desk without a hint of wobble. This is probably thanks to the phone's wedge shape—it's 0.8mm thicker at the top than at the bottom. Read More Read the full review. CNET CNET had good things to say, but basically boiled it down to sure, buy one if you don't want a Samsung phone or an iPhone. As you can tell from its name, Google makes a big deal about the Pixel's camera, and it is superb. It takes even better shots than the already stellar iPhone 7 Plus, which I consider to be the reigning champion of camera phones. If you want the full scoop on how these two compare, check out CNET's feature, Google Pixel vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Which camera is better? The camera is fast, images are in focus and colors look vibrant. Close-up shots appear especially sharp and refined. Landscape scenes retain an impressive amount of detail and depth, even with objects that are far away. Read the full review. The Wall Street Journal WSJ is in love, calling the Pixel "the Android iPhone you've been waiting for." Android people, please step forward. Good news! Your next phone-buying decision just got a heck of a lot easier. The Google Pixel is now the best Android smartphone you can buy. The other leading contender was disqualified due to spontaneous combustion. iPhone people, it’s your turn. Ask yourself: Why do I have an iPhone? Is it because of its software, services and privacy policies? Or is it because it’s a very good phone for things like Google Maps, Gmail, Spotify and Facebook Messenger? If you’ve answered yes to the latter, the Pixel may be for you, too. Read the full review. The Verge The Verge... was also in love, calling the phone a "home run." This is Google's first phone, and for a first effort it is remarkably good. By almost every metric I can think of — speed, power, camera, smart assistant, you name it — it matches or exceeds the best phones available on the market today. And though the design is far from groundbreaking, it’s certainly approachable. The whole package is pretty incredible, and if you're not put off by the premium price, you'll be very happy with this premium phone. I prefer the XL, which isn't huge and seems to get notably better battery life. When I've shown the Pixel to iPhone users over the last week and a half, a bunch of them expressed interest in switching. That is a very good sign for Google. And yet I always asked the exact same questions: "Do you use iMessage a lot? How about group conversations?" The answer was inevitably "yes" and the light dimmed from their eyes a bit. In the US, at least, the Apple ecosystem platform lock-in is real and a big hurdle to jump. Read the full review.

At least not in the way Apple makes the iPhone. This is changing now. Several days ago on October 4, Google announced Pixel and Pixel XL. According to Google, the Pixel phones are the first phones that it has engineered and developed completely in-house. Although technically Motorola phones, when Motorola was a Google-owned company, were also Google official phones and so are the Nexus devices, the Pixel phones are indeed slightly different. Although Google has sold phones using its Play store earlier, this is indeed the first time it is taking full ownership of the phones. Also Read: Best camera ever in Google Pixel phone? It's possible In the coming days, Pixel and Pixel XL will reach shops in India. Pre-orders have already started and Google has already started reaching out to prospective consumers, telling them all about the virtues, as it sees them, of the Pixel phones. Here at India Today Tech, we will take a better look at the Pixel phones in the coming days. But for now, on the basis of a day I have spent with the Pixel XL, there are some quick thoughts on what I make of the Pixels XL (and up to an extent Pixel). Design from HTC Although the Pixel XL is a Google phone, it unmistakably looks like an HTC phone. Well, there is a reason for that. The Pixel XL is a phone manufactured by HTC, even though it carries the Big G logo of Google. And its design is a mishmash of HTC phones, primarily the HTC 10 and the HTC A9. As you expect from a mishmash, the design will leave a user with mixed emotions. It is not a bad design. But it is not great either. The Pixel XL uses an aluminium metal shell, with the left and the right edges carved with clean straight lines, something that we have earlier seen on the HTC 10. On the other hand its curved corners reminded me of the HTC A9 and the iPhone 6. This is a familiar design and we have seen it again and again on high-end -- and now mainstream -- phones. The unique bits to the Pixel design, however, come from the glass portion on the rear and fingerprint scanner. The phone has a conveniently located -- and I must add very fast -- fingerprint sensor on the rear cover. Android in the Pixel XL seems fast and quite beautiful with its clean, flat layer-based users interface. There are no unwanted apps here, unless you count some of the Google apps as unwanted All in all, my impression of the Pixel XL in terms of design is that this is very utilitarian design, and somewhat boring for a phone that costs Rs 67,000. The bezels are thick and various design elements give the fairly generic look. Although with slim profile and, for a 5.5-inch phone, a compact enough frame also means that you can use Pixel single-handedly. Well, most of the time. Compared to a phone like the Galaxy S7 Edge, the Pixel XL doesn't look all that well. But it sure is more convenient to use compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. Google's Android and possibly a killer camera The big story with the Pixel XL is not its design. It is the software inside it. With Pixel phones Google is taking charge of Android back from the phone makers in China and Korea and instead trying to give users a version of Android that will fast, good looking and feature rich. The company is also promising timely updates to Pixel users. All of this sounds very promising and Pixel XL does highlight some of the better aspects of Android. It comes inbuilt with Google Assistant. It seems very smart, smarter than Siri, although I need to spend a bit of more time with it. Then there is a new app drawer -- swipe up from the bottom edge -- and it looks better than the app drawer that is out there by default in the Android 7 aka Nougat. The Pixel XL not only runs a more recent version of Android -- Android 7.1 -- but also has the exclusive Pixel launcher that Google has created. In the Android 7.1 on Pixel XL, Google has added a couple of more unique features. The most intriguing of these seems to be the shortcuts. You long press on an app, and it shows a shortcut. For example, long press on the Chrome app and it shows shortcut for opening a tab or opening an incognito tab. This is very neat. Overall Android in the Pixel XL seems fast and quite beautiful with its clean flat layer-based users interface. There are no unwanted apps here, unless you count some of the Google apps as unwanted. And there is no tacky animations or colours, which we often see on phones made by China-based companies. It also helps that Pixel XL has pretty good hardware inside it. It is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and has 4GB RAM. It also has 32GB internal storage. The AMOLED screen of the phone, at first glance, look beautiful as it shows rich and deep colours. It also seems to be a very bright and vibrant screen, although this is something that will be tested properly once the phone is used outdoors in bright sunlight. iPhone 7 Plus vs Pixel XL: On the left is image by iPhone. On the right the photo by Pixel. The iPhone exposed the image better and has accurate colours. Pixel image has more details, richer colours.Talking of hardware, probably the best part of the phone seems to be the camera. We haven't yet really put the phone's camera through its paces but it seems to capture images that have great detail and extremely punchy colours. Although speed wise -- focus and processing -- it does seem slower than the camera in the iPhone 7 Plus, or for that matter the camera in the Galaxy S7. Also Read: Apple iPhone 7 is good, but OnePlus 3 is much more value for money Summing it up In the coming days I will take a better look at Pixel XL, see how well its battery holds up, whether the phone heats or not, whether its software has bugs or not, and most importantly, see how well it works with the Jio network. You guys do want to know how well it works with Jio, right? But all of that is for later. For now my impression of the Pixel XL is mostly positive, although the design could have been better. For example, it doesn't have the water and dust resistant body, which is kind of a big miss at a time when both Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 have it. Similarly, the glass panel on the back cover looks tacky and useless. But then there is the software and features. The Android 7.1 Nougat inside the Pixel XL looks fantastic and seem to work very very well. It is the kind of software that is going to make you fall in love with Android. And although software is not everything, it matters a lot in a "smartphone".

That might sound like a slightly gawky message, but it's laced with potency. More than at any other time in the history of Android, Google is taking the fight directly to Apple, and the Pixel is the punch into the soft belly of the iPhone.  This is the Google Pixel XL, the larger of the two Pixel devices, and it's Android's new heavyweight champion. Google Pixel XL review: Different design, stunning build Each Pixel device that Google has announced has shared the same quality: an uncompromising approach to design. With the Chromebook Pixel, the first of this new family, an eye-wateringly beautiful laptop was born. The Pixel C tablet followed suit. And now we have the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Pocket-lint Like those previous devices, the Pixel XL pulls no punches. It is cast from a block of aerospace-grade aluminium, anodised for a finish that's as premium as you'll find on any smartphone, with shapely chamfers to the front and curves to the back. In a world where a phone is a slab dominated by the display, the Pixel XL manages to be different. The handset has a polished glass section set into the rear, where the camera and fingerprint scanner sits. Its purpose remains something of a mystery, other than giving this phone a distinctive look. If you wanted to do something to ensure that no one was going to say it was an iPhone clone, that might do it. At first we were unsure about this detail. It seems to serve no purpose, but as we've used the phone more and more, we've come to love the smooth feel of the glass. It's interesting, it's different and - remarkably - it's unique. Pocket-lint From the front the Pixel is less unique. Arguably, if there's one criticism we'd bring to bear against it, it's the height of this phone (at 154.7mm). We criticise the height of the iPhone 7 Plus for the same reason, because there's a little too much bezel above and below the display that doesn't really do anything. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge manages to be shorter and by keeping the controls off the display, makes better use of that space. We think that the S7 edge is the Pixel XL's most natural rival: Samsung's phone is a masterclass in Android adaption, a juxtaposition of Google's Pixel purity. Samsung also offers waterproofing, which is another Pixel weakness - the XL is an IP53 device, for fleeting rain splashes only - although some users are finding the Pixel will survive a dunk in water. Google Pixel XL review: Display to behold When you're choosing between the Pixel and the Pixel XL, there's one difference: the display. Topped with Gorilla Glass 4 to keep scratches at bay, the 5.5-inch display of the XL puts it in an incredibly popular class of big phones. The Pixel XL lives up to its name with a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution display, resulting in a pixel density of 534ppi. Google Pixel XL vs Pixel: Which should you choose? Pocket-lint Quad HD is very much the current standard in flagship phones - the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium went one better with its 806ppi 4K display - but the Pixel XL is every-inch competitive with its rivals. Opting for AMOLED, Google's display choice is fantastically detailed and offers bags of punch and vibrancy. It doesn't push the vibrancy quite as vigorously as Samsung often does so it strikes a more neutral balance. There's richness to colours, deep blacks and nice clean whites, although the latter are slightly on the warm side, not that it matters a great deal. One of the new additions to the Pixel XL is Night Light. This changes the colour temperature of the display in the evenings so it doesn't drown you in blue light and stop you sleeping. It's hardly unique: Apple offers the same, as does Samsung. On the Pixel it's a standard Android feature, so will soon be commonplace we suspect. Pocket-lint We found the adaptive brightness to be good: there's enough brightness to cut through sunny conditions, and it dims well enough for night-time video watching. We also found the screen's polarising layer to be cleverly positioned so the Pixel doesn't blackout in portrait or landscape if you're wearing polarised glasses. Google Pixel XL review: Performance and hardware Launching late in the year, the Pixel XL comes up against comparable rivals that have been on the market for some time. There's a small advantage in that it offers the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, with 4GB RAM, which is a minor upgrade on one of the year's most popular quad-core chipsets. Flagship specs mean flagship performance and the noticeable thing about the Pixel XL is how smooth and fast it is. Much of this will come down to the clean Android build - as there's no bloat - which we'll cover in the software section later.  Importantly, the Pixel XL behaves like the flagship phone that it is. It's fast to open apps, it's fast to react to your commands. For those on the EE network in the UK, it's fast with data too - with top performance when it comes to signal and reception. Pocket-lint There's the option for 32GB or 128GB of storage and as anyone who owned a Nexus will tell you, there's no provision for microSD card expansion here. That's a downside compared to many flagship Android phones. Sure, Apple has never offered expandable storage and that works for iPhone; Android does and in this new competitive "phone by Google" world, customers will expect such features. There's also a fingerprint scanner on the rear, as we mentioned. We're happy with it's positioning, it worked for the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P - and it works here. The fingerprint scanner is easy to find and very quick to unlock the phone. Perhaps the only thing to watch out for is the new swipe gesture (or Move as Google calls it). This allows you swipe down the notifications shade to glance at your alerts and messages, and we've found it very easy to accidentally swipe when handling the phone. Not that it matters much. Pocket-lint There is one speaker in the bottom of the Pixel XL. This provides plenty of volume, but isn't the most accomplished speaker on a smartphone, lacking the smart separation and bassy punch of HTC's BoomSound. It will also distort at high volumes, so you're better off with headphones. Google Pixel tips and tricks: Getting to grips with Google's phone Google Pixel XL review: Battery life Sitting inside the Pixel XL is a 3,450mAh battery. That's likely to put a smile on your face for starters, as generally devices with batteries over 3,000mAh do pretty well in getting you through the day. Indeed the Pixel XL does offer good battery life. It's got us through the day without the need to visit the charger for a top up. We've enjoyed day-long battery, even with that necessary Pokemon Go session while out walking the dog. The XL does offer a battery saver mode, too, but it's the native Android offering and is rather basic. Google will tell you that Android Nougat offers great Doze battery saving without you having to do anything: but sometimes we just want to toggle on a mode to ensure we're not wasting power we don't need to. Pocket-lint There's a USB Type-C connection on the bottom of the Pixel XL and this offers fast charging, so if you do run short of juice then a quick blast will have you back in action again. However, there is no wireless charging. Google Pixel XL review: Unique software charms The Pixel XL launches on Android 7.1 Nougat, bringing with it a number of unique Pixel features, designed to make this device stand-out from other Android phones and to offer a little more than previous Nexus devices of old. Google Pixel vs Google Nexus: What's the difference? That really draws a line between the Pixel and previous "Google" phones. In the Pixel you have an "exclusive launcher", the integration of Google Assistant voice-control on the home button, a unique camera experience, a calendar icon that shows the date rather than just "31" and a few other bits. Again this follows Google's narrative of the Pixel being a more complete and appealing proposition and we have to say, Android is very slick on the Pixel XL. It feels sophisticated, a proposition that's much more consumer than some Nexus devices of the past.  Android 7.x Nougat review: Subtle but super-sweet OS update One of our favourite features isn't exclusive, as it's coming in Android 7.1: app shortcuts. It replicates the sort of thing that you get with a deep press on Apple's iPhone with 3D Touch, but on the Pixel it's just part of the software system, rather than needing a hardware change. These app shortcuts allow you get right back into a conversation, open the camera to take a selfie or open a new Chrome Incognito window without having to open the app first. Pocket-lint Currently this only works on Google's own apps, but we're sure it will come to many other apps soon. It's one of a few small changes in Android that's making everything more immediate, like the proper integration of replies into notifications and more information in the settings menu, so you can see important details at a glance.  There will be a brief window where the Pixel is the most Google-y Android phone around, but with updates coming, a lot of the refinement will be flowing through to other devices. We love the purity, something that's become increasingly consumer friendly on recent Nexus devices, and in the Pixel this refinement is at its purest. Where the Pixel perhaps isn't as exciting as some other devices is in the apps tray. Although it's accessed with a swipe through Pixel Launcher, the apps tray is a fairly basic layout, with no customisation options. You can switch launcher, of course, and the Google Assistant shortcut on the home button will stay in place, but you might lose those fancy app shortcuts in the process. Google Pixel exclusive features explored: A cut above the rest of Android? Google Pixel XL review: Google Assistant One of the top billings for the Pixel is Google Assistant. There's been a lot about how Google is pushing its artificial intelligence system forward. In reality, Google Assistant is an evolution of existing systems established by Google Now and at a surface level works in a similar way. Google Now has always been about tailoring information for you and Google Assistant does the same. What is Google Assistant, how does it work, and how can you use it? Google Assistant tips and tricks: Master your Android assistant Google Assistant is accessed via the "Ok Google" hot word and the real change here is in the visual presentation. It can also be accessed from the Pixel Launcher with a long press on the home button. Where once you had Now On Tap you have Google Assistant instead. That sort of makes sense too, as Google Assistant is designed to be contextually aware, integrated and capable of serving a wide range of your needs. Aside from presentation of results, it's the ongoing conversation with Google Assistant that makes it different - being able to extend a question or topic to find more or do more. Pocket-lint Currently though, it doesn't feel much like a breakthrough into an AI future. Yes, Assistant will do things for you, but it isn't a vast change from existing voice interaction with Google. We're sure that position will change with the launch of Google Home, where Assistant will have a range of tasks to perform that currently don't surface on the phone. Like Siri on the iPhone, we expect to be able to tell Assistant to dim the lights from our Pixel in the future.  There are some cool things that you can do however. We've previously seen integration into Google Allo, the new messenger app, but now you get that outside of Allo - you just have to start talking to Google. There's some app integration, like you can say that you want to watch something on Netflix and it will open on that programme, for example, which is clever. The same has worked for Spotify for some time. There's also clever intrgration with Google Photos and the camera - you can ask Google Assistant to find pictures of your dog, or ask it to take a selfie. Finding things and developing that information can be pretty good, but on many occasions Google Assistant will serve you up a search result and read the answer. That's ok in dealing with a question - like "what is a dangling participle?" - but currently it seems there are a number of dead ends. Google Pixel XL review: Camera The camera is one of the other areas that benefits from some software exclusivity. Unlimited backup storage for full resolution of photos and videos is a serious proposition and applies to all photos and video you take on your Pixel, along with smart storage that will erase backed-up photos from your device as storage needs increase. No worries about running out of space on the Pixel XL. Pocket-lint The camera app makes a step forward towards usability, too, coming from a position of relative weakness in previous years. Nexus devices never really did well in the camera department until the Nexus 6P shook things up in 2015 with its great performance. However, the Pixel app is still rather basic. Gunning for the iPhone means delivering on the camera and the Pixel aims to deliver a simple camera that works. The bad news is no real manual controls and very few menu options. The good news is that you can pretty much just point and shoot and you'll usually get good results, which is the important point. The 12.3-megapixel camera on the Pixel XL is very fast to capture. It employs auto HDR+ (high dynamic range) as a default to make the best out of scene. We're fans of that setup on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7, as these days it generally means you get great results in a wide range of conditions. Here you can engage HDR+ proper, or leave it in auto mode which is faster and the results aren't hugely different. Pocket-lint Indoors it is prone to white balance mishaps however. On both the Pixel and Pixel XL, we've found some indoor shots that look very yellow, as though it's misinterpreted the conditions. That can be corrected by manually selecting the white balance and perhaps switching to "tungsten", for a more natural look. With 1.55µm pixels in the sensor and f/2.0 aperture, low-light performance is pretty good too although there's no optical image stabilisation. In lower light there's fine grain which can reduce the contrast and detail. In very dark conditions image noise crashes in and with no options for manual lengthy exposures or anything else, it's not really a "pro" camera in that sense, more a reliable point-and-shoot. Google has clung on to some of the old Google Camera features in its Pixel Camera which are less exciting: Photo Sphere remains an option, as does the old Lens Blur option, which gives you a sort of bokeh effect. The fun addition is slow motion video with 120fps and 240fps options, with the easy option of selecting the portion you want in slow-mo. Pocket-lint Elsewhere video capture offers 30fps and 60fps up to Full HD, with 4K video offered at 30fps. Video stabilisation is effective, so you can walk down the road and get pretty smooth results. This is all effortless too, which is great. Overall, we feel that the Pixel XL could make more of its camera with a more encompassing app. For those wanting to push the camera's capabilities, the answer might lie in a different app. However, as many iPhone owners will tell you, often it's just about pointing and shooting. In these conditions, the Pixel XL delivers. Verdict The Pixel XL is the most accomplished phone that's come from Google. The dabs of consumer refinement that Pixel has applied makes the Nexus programme feel like beta testing. And Google loves beta testing, so in many ways the Pixel is the result of learning through all those Nexus phones. The XL is a pure delivery of Android: it's fast, it's fun, it's high quality; it has exclusive features, the camera works and the battery lasts too. For many, however, the stumbling block will be the price. The Pixel XL is priced to rival the iPhone 7 Plus; not undercut it, but to look it straight in the face and stare it down. The Pixel refuses to accept the position that Android offers you more for less, because as it is, the Pixel will struggle to answer questions from the much cheaper OnePlus 3 or the slightly cheaper Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. Fortunately the Pixel XL delivers. It's a premium smartphone at a premium price, but it offers a truly premium experience. And thanks to that glass panel on the back, there'll be no mistaking that you're carrying around the hottest Android phone in town. From £719, Google Originally published 18 October 2016.

With the launch of Google's Pixel-branded smartphones, Google has officially unleashed Assistant in full form. The personal assistant is exclusive to the Pixel and Pixel XL, at least initially, bringing Apple Siri-like and Microsoft Cortana-like and Amazon Alexa-like functionality to the handsets. You can ask Assistant almost anything, and it will understand your words in context and serve up relevant results in a conversational manner. Assistant even has a (female) voice - meaning Assistant can actually talk back to you, and yes, it'll have a sense of humour. To help you figure out everything Assistant does on the phone, we've rounded up some expert tips and tricks. Browse them all below. But keep checking back to see what else we've added, because we plan to continually update this piece over time. What is Google Assistant? Google Assistant is Google's iteration of a personal assistant. It's considered an upgrade or an extension of Google Now, as well as an expansion of Google's existing "OK Google" voice controls. It's conversational, too. You can ask a question and follow-up questions, and Assistant will track the conversation, determine context, and audibly respond with the right information. What is Google Assistant, how does it work, and when can you use it? Google Assistant US vs UK We've already spotted that the US and the UK currently offer up slightly different services in Google Assistant. This is likely to continue when Google Home launches. Currently, the UK doesn't offer the full collection of news services that the US does, but here we're listing tips and tricks for everyone - you just might not not be able to access them all right now. Google Assistant tips and tricks Getting started When you first get your Pixel smartphone, power it on, and start setting it up, you'll be asked to use Google Assistant and "OK Google" always-on voice detection. You'll have to set up an "OK Google" voice model so that the phone can recognise your voice at any time and activate Google Assistant to serve your needs (whether that be to play music, fetch the weather forecast, or whatever). Pick the right Google account for Assistant Google Assistant feeds off your Google account, just as Google Now does. It's important to make sure that you setup Assistant with the the same account that you're going to be asking it to find information from, especially when it comes to photos. If you use one account for Assistant and a different account for your Google Photos, then it won't have access. Adjust settings Google Assistant has a Settings menu. Under this menu, you can do everything from adjust your "OK Google" voice model to see a summary of your activity generated by Assistant. To access Assistant's Settings menu, open the Settings app, and then go to Google > Search & Now > and Settings (under Google Assistant). From there, you'll see several submenus with settings options. Alternatively, from any screen including the home screen, hold down the Home button, then tap More button (three vertical dots) in the top left of the Assistant screen, and select Settings. Enable/disable Assistant Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Adjust settings for this Pixel device". Beneath that, you'll see a toggle next to Assistant. When you turn on the toggle, you give Assistant permission to answer questions and get things done. Customise your news list Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "News" beneath the Pixel section. Tap it to customise your news list. You'll have to hit the customise link on the next screen, but then you can select a bunch of news sources, including NPR, PBS, CBS, and more. After you select which news sources you'd like to hear from, you can ask Assistant to narrate the news for you. This isn't currently available in the UK. Customise 'My Day' summary Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "My Day" beneath the Pixel section. Tap it to customise your daily briefing. You can select from a handful of options, including weather, work commute, reminders, whether you'd like to end your day with a narration of the news. After you're done, you can ask Assistant for a readout of your day and get responses interesting to you. In the UK, you currently only get the time and weather. Access Shopping List Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Shopping List" beneath the Pixel section. Tap it to access your Shopping List via the Google Keep app. This isn't currently enabled in the UK: asking to view your shopping list in the UK gives you an error from the US voice, which is strange. Enable/disable screen context Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Adjust settings for this Pixel device". Beneath that, you'll see a toggle next to "Use screen context", which is basically Now on Tap 2.0. When you turn on the toggle, you give Assistant permission to show you info related to what's on your screen. It might show you relevant links in YouTube or IMDB, for instance. Change your Assistant language Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Adjust settings for this Pixel device". Beneath that, you'll see "Assistant Language". Tap it to see Language Preferences, where you can select your default language and add a language. Enable/disable always-on 'OK Google' Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Adjust settings for this Pixel device". Beneath that, you'll see "'OK Google' detection". Tap it. From there, turn on the toggle for "Say 'OK Google' any time" to give Assistant permission to recognise your voice whenever you say "OK Google" - even if your screen is off or you're using an app. This makes Assistant always-on. Use 'OK Google' to unlock device Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Adjust settings for this Pixel device". Beneath that, you'll see "'OK Google' detection". Tap it. From there, turn on the toggle for "Trusted Voice" to give Assistant permission to unlock your device when it hears you say "OK Google" (the sound you make must match your previously recorded "OK Google" voice model, however). Retrain 'OK Google' voice model Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Adjust settings for this Pixel device". Beneath that, you'll see "'OK Google' detection". Tap it. From there, tap "Retrain voice model". You'll then have to re-say "OK Google" a few times so that Assistant can remember and recognise how you say the phrase. It can then use the phrase as a wake word and device-unlock word. Delete 'OK Google' voice model Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Adjust settings for this Pixel device". Beneath that, you'll see "'OK Google' detection". Tap it. From there, tap "Delete voice model" so that Assistant can't remember and recognise how you say the phrase. Keep in mind you then can't use the phrase. Use offensive words with voice Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Adjust settings for this Pixel device". Beneath that, you'll see "'Voice". Tap it. From there, turn on the toggle for "Block offensive words" so that Assistant will recognise (and won't hide them either) in voice results. Set your home and work locations Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Google Account settings". Beneath that, you'll see "'Personal info". Tap it. From there, you'll see the option to add your Home and work locations. Tap it, and then manually enter your addresses. If you've been using Google Now previously, this information will probably already be in place. Set your nickname Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Google Account settings". Beneath that, you'll see "'Personal info". Tap it. From there, you'll see the option to add your nicknames. Tap it, and then manually enter your nicknames. You can also test that Google knows how to say it correctly. Change weather units Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Google Account settings". Beneath that, you'll see "'Personal info". Tap it. From there, you'll see the option to change your weather units. Tap it, and then select from Fahrenheit or Celsius. View 'My Activity' summary Under the Assistant's settings, scroll to "Google Account settings". Beneath that, you'll see "'My Activity". Tap it. From there, a screen will pop up showing you all the "control data generated by your Assistant". Things you can say and do Google Assistant is your personal assistant. It can play music for you, set reminders, check your flight, and more. Here's a few things you can say and do with Assistant using just your voice. You just have to say "OK Google" or press and hold the Home button on the Pixel phones to access Assistant. Play music To ask Assistant to play some music, say "OK Google" followed by "play some music", "play some Jazz", "play some workout music", "listen to Daft Punk", or "listen to Imagine on Spotify", etc. If you have more than one music app, it will give you the option of the service you want to use, open it up and start playing. If you're playing Spotify on another device, Google Assistant can still control what you play, too. Watch something on Netflix To fire Netflix and get watching, say "OK Google" followed by what you want to watch: "Watch Luke Cage on Netflix". This will open Luke Cage on Netflix. You don't have to watch Luke Cage, but you should, it's good. Listen to news To ask Assistant to narrate news from sources you've pre-selected, say "OK Google" (or hold down the Home button) followed by "what's the news", "international news", "what's the news about Obama", or "sports news", etc. As we said, you can't do this in the UK yet. Ask about your day To ask Assistant for your daily briefing, say "OK Google" followed by "good morning", "good afternoon", or "good evening", etc. You'll get the weather, upcoming meetings, a news narration, etc, with different options in different territories. Set reminders To ask Assistant to set reminders for you, say "OK Google" followed by "set a reminder...", " remind me to buy milk", "remind me to buy milk tonight", "remind me to call mom", or "remind me to do laundry when I get home", etc. Set alarms To ask Assistant to set an alarm for you, say "OK Google" followed by "set an alarm...", "wake me up at 9 am", wake me up at 10 am everyday", "set my alarm for 8 am", or "show my alarms", etc. Ask about the weather To ask Assistant about the weather, say "OK Google" followed by "what's the weather", "will it rain tomorrow", "how hot is it outside", "what's the temperature", or "forecast for the weekend", etc. Fetch sports news To ask Assistant about sports news, say "OK Google" followed by "Did the Red Sox win", "tell me sports news", "when's the baseball game", "who is the fastest man alive", or "what is the Real Madrid roster" etc. Ask a question To ask Assistant a general question, say "OK Google" and then ask any question, such as "who is Archimedes", "how far is the moon", "how many ounces in a cup", or "how many ounces in a pound", or "what is a dangling participle" etc. In many cases, Google will read the information back to you, telling you the source. Find stuff nearby To ask Assistant to find stuff nearby, say "OK Google" followed by commands like "find a restaurant", "nearby events", "nearby hotel", "what are some nearby pubs", or "what comedy movies are playing" etc. Find stuff while traveling To ask Assistant to find stuff while you're traveling, say "OK Google" followed by "flights to New York", "hotels in Boston", "restaurants in Barcelona", "where can I hike in France", or "Is United flight 16 on time", etc. Check your next flight or booking With Google Now ripping flights out of Gmail, Assistant will know things about your booked travel. Just say "OK Google" then "what's my next flight" and you'll get a list of upcoming flights. You can also ask "when am I going to Barcelona?" and you'll get the details of your Barcelona flight, for example.  Do real-time translations To ask Assistant to do real-time translations for you, say "OK Google" followed by "'Hello' in Spanish", "'Thank you' in Japanese", "What's 'Good morning' in Italian", or "Translate 'airport' to French" etc. Place a call To ask Assistant to place a call for you, say "OK Google" followed by "call Sally", "make a phone call", "call Alice Walker", or "call mom at home", etc. Send a message To ask Assistant to send a message for you, say "OK Google" followed by "send a message", "text Eric", "send a WhatsApp message", "text Alice arriving at 5pm", or "tell Sally I'll be 5 mins late", etc. Set timers To ask Assistant to set a timer, say "OK Google" followed by "set a timer", "countdown 1 minute", "start a timer for 10 mins", or "set a timer for 5 minutes", etc. Open any app To ask Assistant to open an app for you, say "OK Google" followed by "open YouTube", "Open Calendar", or "Open Wi-Fi Settings", etc. Search Play Store To ask Assistant to find an app for you in Play Store, say "OK Google" followed by "Facebook in Play Store", "WhatsApp in Play Store", "Uber in Play Store", or "Twitter in Play Store", etc. Search Google To ask Assistant to search Google, say "OK Google" followed by "search for..." followed by whatever you're looking for - be it vacation idea, zebra facts, funny one-liners, or facts about the moon, etc. See what's on your calendar To ask Assistant to look at your calendar, say "OK Google" followed by "what's on my calendar". Show your photos, show photos of your dog, food, kids To ask Assistant to show your Google Photos, say "OK Google" followed by "show me my photos". Google Photos knows that photos contain, so it will also return photos of objects, like your dog, food, kids or places, just say "show my pictures of cars" and you'll get your car photos displayed. See your emails To ask Assistant to show your Gmail emails, say "OK Google" followed by "show me my emails". This will display emails from your linked account. Google Assistant currently can't read messages. Voice dictate in apps To use Assistant to dictate in supported messaging apps, including Google's own Messaging app, tap the microphone icon in your keyboard. Get directions To ask Assistant to help you navigate, say "OK Google" (or hold down the Home button) followed by "navigate home", "navigate to work", "directions to 100 Main Street", "Navigate to the nearest coffee shop", or "navigate to the post office", etc. This will calculate the route and open up Google Maps Navigation. Unlock your device To ask Assistant to unlock your device, simply say "OK Google" (must enable Trusted Voice under Settings). If you're in a loud place, it might not recognise your voice properly. Fetch screen context To ask Assistant to show info related to what's visible on your screen, hold down the Home button. Take a selfie Google Assistant will help with this essential task. Simply say "OK Google" followed by "take a selfie". This will instantly open the camera and start a 3 2 1 countdown. Remember to smile. Toss a coin The universal method of decision making. Say "OK Google" and then "toss a coin". Assistant will toss that coin and let you know if it's heads or tails. Turn on flashlight "OK Google" then "turn on flashlight" will turn on the flash on your phone. Great for peering into dark holes.  Fun and games Google Assistant can be funny, like Siri. And it's good at keeping your mind occupied when you're feeling bored. Here's a few things that Assistant can do beyond working day and night to serve your every need. Play a game To ask Assistant to play a game, simply say "OK Google" (or hold down the Home button) followed by "play a game". Play trivia To ask Assistant to play trivia, simply say "OK Google" (or hold down the Home button) followed by "play trivia". It'll then let you choose from various subjects, such as math, geography, entertainment, etc. Say 'I'm bored' To ask Assistant to entertain you, simply say "OK Google" (or hold down the Home button) followed by "I'm bored". It'll then let you play a game, or it'll tell you a joke. It'll even "surprise you with some random fun". Ask for a poem To ask Assistant to recite a poem, simply say "OK Google" (or hold down the Home button) followed by "recite a poem".  Ask for a joke To ask Assistant to tell you a joke, simply say "OK Google" (or hold down the Home button) followed by "tell me a joke". You can then ask for one more. Ask for a random number Say "OK Google" (or hold down the Home button) followed by "tell me a random number". What comes next may surprise you. Ask the ultimate riddle Tolkien fans will be familiar with this one. Say "OK Google" then "what have I got in my pocket?". You're welcome. What's the meaning of life? Fans of Douglas Adams might be less impressed: say "OK Google" then "what's the meaning of life?". Comedy is great, but we're a little saddened by the result. I'm feeling lucky This the perhaps the jewel in the crown of Google Assistant's skills. Say "OK Google" followed by "I'm feeling lucky". We won't ruin the surprise, but Google Assistant really goes to town in dealing with Google's iconic question.  Finally, getting more philosophical... Try asking Google Assistant "when am I?"

Britta O'Boyle and Chris Hall18 October 2016Phones Google/Samsung Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment With the Note 7 having died a death, there's a big hole in some people's smartphone choices. Fortunately there are some very strong candidates. But do you go with Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge, or embrace the new Google Phone, the Pixel XL? We've lived with both, reviewed both and here's how the Pixel XL compares to the S7 edge in terms of both numbers and experience to help you work out which one to choose. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review Google Pixel XL review Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Galaxy S7 edge: Design Both beautiful premium designs S7 edge is smaller, lighter and a little more exciting S7 edge is more water resistant The Google Pixel XL and the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge offer beautiful, solid and premium designs. The Pixel XL opts for a mostly aluminium body, with a glass panel at the top of its rear, while the S7 edge has an aluminium frame with curved edges and an all-glass rear panel. The Pixel is the slightly larger and heavier of the two devices, measuring 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5mm and weighing 168g, compared to the S7 edge's 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7mm build and 157g weight. Samsung manages to be more compact. Both have a fingerprint sensor, but Google's is mounted on the rear, with no physical buttons on the front, while Samsung chooses to place it within the main button on the front of the S7 edge. Samsung's device is also IP68-rated for water and dust resistance, while Google's is only IP53. Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Galaxy S7 edge: Display Both have same size and resolution AMOLED displays S7 edge has curved screen Both protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4 The Google Pixel XL and Samsung Galaxy S7 edge both feature 5.5-inch AMOLED displays with 2560 x 1440 pixel resolutions, putting the pixel density at 534ppi. They are both protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The S7 edge does offer a curved display however, as we mentioned, meaning it looks more interesting from a design point of view. The curved display also offers a couple of extras when it comes to software features, though none of them are make or break features. Samsung's display is a little more impactful. Both are bright and vibrant, the Pixel XL is perhaps more natural, but Samsung's is a little more vigorous. Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Galaxy S7 edge: Camera Same resolution rear camera, but Pixel XL has higher resolution front snapper Pixel XL has larger pixels, S7 edge has wider aperture S7 edge has OIS, Pixel XL has both PDAF and LDAF Samsung has more control options The Google Pixel XL has a 12-megapixel rear camera with 1.55µm pixels and an aperture of f/2.0. It has an LED flash, along with phase detection autofocus and laser autofocus. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge also offers a 12-megapixel rear camera, but its aperture is slightly wider at f/1.7. Pixels are a little smaller at 1.4µm and there is only phase detection autofocus on board. Samsung also includes optical image stabilisation, which the Pixel XL does not. In terms of front camera, the Pixel XL offers an 8-megapixel sensor with 1.4µm pixels and an aperture of f/2.4 with fixed focus. The S7 edge on the other hand, has a 5-megapixel selfie camera with an f/1.7 aperture and 1.34µm pixels. Both are excellent performers, giving good consistent results, but Samsung offers many more control options meaning more flexibility. The Pixel XL keeps it simple with fewer settings which will probably suffice for many and it's very fast to capture. Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Galaxy S7 edge: Hardware Both have 4GB of RAM Pixel XL has more internal storage, but no microSD support S7 edge has larger battery, but Pixel XL uses USB Type-C The Google Pixel XL features Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 821 processor under its hood, supported by 4GB of RAM. It comes in 32GB and 128GB storage options, with no support for microSD expansion and it offers a 3450mAh battery, charged via USB Type-C. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge has either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip, or the Exynos 8890 processor, depending on region. Both are supported by 4GB of RAM, but storage options top out at 64GB. Samsung offers microSD however and it offers a larger battery capacity at 3600mAh, charged via Micro-USB. Both the Pixel XL and the S7 edge have quick charge capabilities, the S7 edge offers wireless charging too. Both devices are superbly powerful and both will get you through a busy day of use. The Pixel XL offers unlimited photo and video storage online through Google Photos. Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Galaxy S7 edge: Software Both the Pixel XL and the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge run on Android. The Pixel XL launches with Android 7.1 Nougat, with exclusive software features that won't be appearing on other Android handsets. Pure Nougat, enhanced with the Pixel Launcher and Google Assistant, brings a level of sophistication to this Google phone that surpasses Pixels. It has the bloat-free attitude of a pure Android handset, but supercharged. It's slick, fast and powerful. Samsung takes Android 6.0 Marshmallow, adds TouchWiz and makes the experience completely unique to Samsung. There's the addition of more options, settings and choices galore. That brings some bloat and plenty of duplication, but there's so much on offer from Samsung and on the S7 edge it's very well executed. Our preference is for the cleaner approach of the Pixel XL, but it's a tough call. Ultimately, the experience of both devices is very good. Samsung Galaxy S7 tips and tricks: Master your new Galaxy Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Galaxy S7 edge: Price S7 edge is cheaper S7 edge has more colour options The Google Pixel XL starts at £719 for the 32GB model, while the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge starts at £639 for the same storage. The Pixel XL comes in two colours comprising Quite Black and Very Silver, compared to the S7 edge's five options that include Gold, Pink Gold and Silver. Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Galaxy S7 edge: Conclusion The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge has been one of our favourite devices of 2016. It's accomplished on so many levels, from the eye-catching design with the benefit of waterproofing, through to the wonderful curves of the display. We still think it is one of the nicest devices to use in the Android space right now. The Pixel's appeal comes in its purer Android form. It's a very Google-y phone, putting your Google services at the heart and offering the very latest features from Android. Google Assistant is an enhancement, there are tweaks you'll not find anywhere else. You'll be first on the update list too. Both devices offer a slick and fast experience so there's little to choose in terms of performance or quality. Samsung is tempting with a cheaper price, microSD card support and wonderful camera, but come February, it's likely to be replaced with something better, so the Pixel XL might be the one to choose.

This was what the Nexus range was all about. But this lead to at least a few compromises.  With the arrival of Daydream VR, and with so many hardware makers falling on financial hard times, Google couldn't afford any compromises. The Pixel is the company's first home-made smartphone. It offers the latest version of Android, with a few Pixel-specific features, and support for the as-yet-unreleased VR system. Google Pixel Review: Design The Pixel may not have been technically built by Google, but neither is the iPhone technically built by Apple. It's commonplace to have another company building the actual hardware. For the Pixel, Google chose HTC, a company which has seen its own-brand devices slump in popularity over recent years. But here's the good part: HTC knows how to build really good phones. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: When and where can I get them? Think back to the Nexus One, undoubtedly one of the best-made Nexus phones released. It was built by HTC. More recently, the HTC One Series, ranging from the M7 to M9, all drew plaudits for their industrial design. In short: Google couldn't have picked a better hardware manufacturer. And it shows in the device. Everything about the exterior design and manufacturing feels deliberate, purposeful and precise. Whether you're looking at the textured power button, the Type-C port and flanking cutouts for the mic and speaker, the 3.5mm jack or the weird glass panel on the back, it's all exact. Pocket-lint Then there's the soft bead-blasted metal finish on the back which rounds really nicely towards the perfectly flat edges and the large angle chamfers. All of it is so well finished and designed, it's impossible to ignore. We're not particularly fond of the unusual-looking glass panel on the back, which hosts the camera, sensors, dual-tone LED flash and circular fingerprint sensor. But we get it. In an era where so many smartphones look the same, it's nice to have something different, something that says "this is the Pixel phone". With that, and the single "G" stamped on the back, it's recognisable as a device all of its own. Google Pixel tips: First things to do with your new Google superphone One element that's difficult to get used to is the position of the volume and power buttons. Most phones tend to have the power button lowest, whereas Google opted to put the power button above the volume switch. That means it's easy to accidentally turn volume down, rather than send the phone to sleep. Pocket-lint All these perks and quirks are packed in to a phone which fits really nicely in the hand, feels durable, and has a heft of class without being too heavy. Google Pixel Review: Display With the Pixel being the smaller of the two new Google phones, the 5-inch screen features fewer pixels than its big brother, the Pixel XL. While the larger model has a Quad HD screen, the Pixel has a Full HD panel. Still, 1080 x 1920 pixels shoved into a display that's only 5-inches diagonally makes for a very sharp screen. At 441 pixels per inch, everything is crisp. It is AMOLED too, and comes with all the benefits and drawbacks of choosing that over LCD. Specifically, colours are vibrant, contrast is high and blacks are deep. That means it's fantastic for watching movies, gaming, or viewing anything with lots of colour. Pocket-lint It does mean that whites aren't quite as pure as they would be on a good LCD panel - they come across as ever so slightly warm, but you're unlikely to notice unless you have it side-by-side with an iPhone or other device. On the whole, the Pixel's display is one of the nicest we've seen on a phone at this scale. The panel itself is so close to the glass surface that viewing angles are superb, and content almost appears as if it's on the surface. Google Pixel Review: Software The Google Pixel comes with the brand new version of Android Nougat. But you can take what you know about 7.0 Nougat and throw it away, because the Pixel Launcher and software are considerably different to the software we've been using since the first Nexus developer preview went live a few months ago. Pocket-lint First up is Google Assistant, the voice controlled assistant. It is, essentially, Google Now packaged in to a more human, chat-like user interface. It has many of the same functions you're used to - like telling you the weather, knowing your calendar events, setting reminders, sports scores and much more - but packaged in to an interface that's more intuitive. Part of the setup process - when first powering up the phone - is training it to recognise your voice, the same way Google Now does when you want the "Ok Google" command to wake it up when it's dormant. You can also launch it by tapping and holding the virtual home button. Now, instead of launching a Google Search interface, the command launches a chat thread, similar to Google Allo, the company's messaging app, in the bottom half of the screen which then expands once a question has been posed.  Pocket-lint The beauty of Google Assistant is that it keeps learning. As time goes by, and you use it more, its predictive reply suggestions are more tailored to the kinds of things you would ask or say. Like Google Allo, these appear as individual bubbles underneath the most recent response from Google.  Unlike every version of Android so far, there's no app drawer button. The familiar dotted circle icon has been replaced by an app drawer that simply drags up from the bottom of the home screen. While the gesture feels more intuitive, the biggest benefit of this is that it allows you to have a fifth app icon pinned to the dock. Google Pixel tips and tricks: Getting to grips with Google's phone The app icons themselves have been given a new feature too. Similar to the iPhone, you can bring up app shortcuts for some of the default Android apps like Messenger, Calendar, Camera and Dialler. Because there's no pressure sensitive screen, you bring these up by long-pressing the app.  Another new addition in the Pixel launcher is the wallpaper picker, which now has a vast collection of default wallpapers, including some breathtaking landscapes and cityscapes from professional photographers, as well as Google's own live wallpapers. Some of these react and change colour to match the time and the weather, others are just Google Earth images that move slowly and react as you swipe through home screen spaces.  Pocket-lint All the default app icons are now round, as are the folder windows, and you can quick-reply to notifications without leaving the app you're in, or from the lock screen. But, apart from those design changes and features, there are some real benefits to having a Pixel phone over another Android smartphone.  Firstly, the Google Photos app allows you backup all of your photos in full size, original resolution, for free. Normally, on other Android phones or iPhone, you only get free unlimited backup space if you choose to reduce the quality. What's more, there's no time limit on the offer. As long as you have the Pixel phone, you get full resolution backups.  Secondly, the Settings app has a second tab giving you quick, easy access to a support team. You can call them or start a text-based chat with them as they help you through any issues you're having.  Pocket-lint Apart from those features, the software is otherwise Android 7.1 Nougat as we know it. That includes the split-screen multitasking mode, which seems a little wasted on a 5-inch screen. Although it is still useful for those odd moments when you need to reference a video, map position, or quote while typing an email or message.  Easy access to your battery performance from the drop-down menu - which, by the way, you can access now by swiping down on the Pixel Imprint sensor on the back - is a much welcome addition, as is the ability to add, remove and rearrange quick settings tiles.  Google Pixel Review: Performance One of the benefits of creating its own phone, is that the Google software can be fine-tuned to run like a charm on the hardware. With its clean, stock Android experience, there's no bloat or additional software to get in the way. That means everything is very snappy and smooth in operation. In fact, we'd go as far as saying it's the most responsive Android phone we've ever used. Pocket-lint While a big part of that is the new lightweight software experience, it's also down to the efficient and powerful Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor and 4GB RAM that's on board. Game animations are stutter-free and smooth, while load times are as quick as you'd hope for from a flagship phone. It may not get the highest benchmark scores we've seen during tests, but it still runs like a dream - and that, ultimately, is what matters most. There's the option for 32 or 128GB of storage and as anyone who owned a Nexus will tell you, there's no provision for microSD card expansion here. That's a downside compared to many flagship Android phones. Sure, Apple has never offered expandable storage and that works for iPhone; Android does and in this new competitive "phone by Google" world, customers will expect such features. Google Pixel Review: Battery Life On paper, the 2,770mAh battery may not seem like it would be capacious enough to offer great battery life, but that's where numbers on paper can deceive. There are a couple of things worth taking in to consideration that ensure the Pixel's battery lasts well beyond a full day of regular use. First is thanks again to that software. Like Android Marshmallow before it, Android 7 Nougat has Google Doze. This essentially means that when the phone is put down on a surface and in standby, any excessive background processes are killed. This ensures there's little battery usage when the phone isn't in use, like when you're asleep. Unlike Marshmallow, Nougat's Doze mode is also active when the phone is in your pocket, or in your hand. It doesn't have to be lying still on a flat surface. In short: if your phone isn't being used, your battery isn't either. Pocket-lint With light use, our Pixel got from 07:30 to 18:00 with 60 per cent of its capacity left. For light users, this Pixel phone could even be a two day phone. Most days, we got to bed time with between 30-40 per cent charge remaining. That was after spending most of the evening testing the phone's performance (AKA playing hours of Temple Run 2). For heavy users, we suspect the Pixel would still get you to the end of a work day comfortably. Regardless of how long it lasts any specific user, the phone still charges really quickly, thanks to its Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support. Google claims you can get seven hours worth of battery juice from plugging it in for just 15 minutes. Our experience says you should be able to fully charge it in little over an hour. Google Pixel Review: Camera Google claims its camera is among the best out there, pointing to the often-cited DxOMark mobile scores to prove to us all that it's the best camera on a smartphone to date. In our experience, it is good, but it's far from perfect. Pocket-lint One of its early flaws - which could presumably fixed with a software update - is its tendency to get the white balance wrong. In some photos, it applies a white balance as if lightning is incredibly cool, and overcompensates by making the scene more yellow. Almost as if an orange filter has been placed on the outside of the lens. We found this happened on both the front and rear facing camera. With that said, it is capable of producing some really great shots. Even without manual controls - which we've come to expect from top Android phones - it can create photographs with great colour and detail. Perhaps more impressive is that it captures them very quickly. There's almost zero waiting time between hitting the shutter button and the shot being captured. One element which surprised us was how well it coped in low-light situations. Even without manual exposure settings, and with the flash switched off, it can shoot sharp, blur-free images with great colour quality. Pocket-lint It sometimes has trouble focusing on objects close-up, so macro shots are hit and miss. With instances like this, and with the white balance issues, we can't help but feel a manual or "pro" mode with customisable ISO, shutter speed, white balance and focus would be hugely beneficial. But that's not the Pixel's focus: it's all about simplicity. Verdict The Google Pixel is the best Android experience available right now. For the first time we get to see exactly what Google has in mind for hardware design and features. Google is completely in control, and you can tell. Everything is tight, refined and polished to a degree we've never seen in a Nexus phone. Of course, this year, the Pixel arrives without the usual Nexus cheaper-than-flagship price. Indeed, the Pixel costs as much as an iPhone - and that could potentially come back to bite Google. On the other hand, with Samsung's reputation needing some serious work given Note 7 issues, the more-expensive-than-usual Android phone couldn't have come at a better time for Google. If you're after a 5-inch Android smartphone then there's simply nothing else on the market that compares to the Pixel. And because it's a Pixel, made by Google, you'll get prompt software updates, regularly, promptly and for at least a few years. You're not at the whim of a hardware manufacturer or a network operator.

As a lifelong iPhone user, I decided to put Google to the test and find out how well that process really works. And after spending a weekend working through it, I came to a nuanced and messy conclusion. Broadly speaking, migrating works fine, but the nitty-gritty details of the process are painful to deal with. I expected the transition to be far from frictionless. After all, I use iCloud Photo Library to sync my photos, correspond with my friends using iMessage, track my exercise with an Apple Watch and use a Mac. Migrating wasn't going to be easy, but I wanted to give it a shot anyway and see whether the Pixel XL lived up to Google's hype. On Friday morning, I pulled my SIM card out of my iPhone and stuck it into a new Pixel XL that Google provided for review. I fired the phone up, and it walked me through the process of trying to move my contacts, calendars, email and messages. Google also offers to migrate users' music and photos, but can't transfer snaps only saved in iCloud Photo Library, or iTunes music that's DRM-protected or stored in Apple's cloud, so I skipped that. The whole process took about a half hour, and I was left with a phone that promised to be personalized for me, just like my old one. My text message conversations were all there, and my contacts carried over. My iCloud-synced calendars were copied into Google Calendar, too. I was then faced with the next hurdle: getting all the apps I wanted onto the new phone. I installed 37 new apps, in addition to those Google provided. In the process, I had to find alternatives for several of the apps I use every day, which meant switching my to-do list, podcast app and Twitter client. It wasn't a super-costly process, but I also didn't try to replace the apps and hardware I'd be missing if I made a full migration. (Replacing an Apple Watch for fitness tracking would be difficult, for example.) After all that, I finally got to settle into the Pixel XL. The transition to Android didn't feel as foreign as I had feared. Many of the apps I was already used to on iOS have analogs on Android that feel similar. The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone didn't feel nearly as weird to use as I anticipated, especially after I got used to gripping the phone. As I got more comfortable with the phone, however, more annoyances started showing up. Photo attachments to text messages, which Google promised to import, didn't show up in line in the conversation, like they did on my iPhone. Instead, each image was replaced with a helpful message that I could find them in my phone's Photos app. But the photos in that folder aren't organized in any way, with some images that I received months ago showing up right alongside photos that arrived in the past week as though they all came in at the same time. Using the new Google Assistant was impressive at times, but didn't feel like a game-changer. In some cases, it was better at understanding my queries than Siri, while Apple's virtual assistant handled other situations better. Overall, I'd give Google the edge in voice recognition accuracy and experience, but it doesn't feel like an insurmountable lead. Migration once again introduced some issues. My relationship information is all loaded up in my iOS contacts, so Siri knows who my parents are. But when I asked the Google Assistant how old my Dad was, it didn't know who I was talking about. When I gave it his name, I assumed it would associate that with the contact card of the same name already on my phone. It didn't. Moreover, making reservations using the Assistant -- one of the things that Google advertised heavily -- was finnicky and difficult. The interface clearly shows potential, but the execution isn't quite there yet. Siri and Google both integrate with OpenTable, and I'm unconvinced that I can find a reservation using either of them faster than I could just use the OpenTable app.  Don't get me wrong: the Pixel XL is a great phone. Google's done well with this one, and I look forward to seeing what comes of it in the future. But making the move over to it from iOS when I'm so invested in Apple's platform already felt like death from a few dozen different, tiny cuts, without a shiny reward for my troubles. People who already rely on services that have a stronger cross-platform component like Fitbit for fitness and Spotify for music will have an easier time making the move. It'll be easier still if their photos are already in Google Photos and they already use Google Calendar. If I was looking for a new phone without any baggage of migrating, I'd be taking a good, long look at the Pixel line. But I have a shiny, new iPhone 7 that I enjoy using already, and it has the benefit of working with all the iOS-only apps and services that I love. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to switch iMessage back on. Brand Post Why Hybrid Cloud? More from Datacom Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The content of your articles and blog post should be new, fresh and original. It should add something to all the junk that’s already out there on the internet. In this post, I’ll explain the importance of original content for SEO to you. Google’s mission In order to understand why original content is important for SEO, we should take a look at Google’s mission. Google’s mission reads ‘to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.’ So, in order for Google to rank your content, you should write something that is accessible and useful for your audience. Your information should add something to all the other information on the internet (about a certain topic). It should offer your audience something that is not offered in other blogs, articles or websites. What is original content? Original content doesn’t necessarily mean new content. Of course, if your story is totally new, that’ll automatically mean it’s original. However, giving your (professional) opinion on a certain topic also counts as original content. Your angle to a story could be the thing that makes your content unique and original. Original content could also be an overview of (older) information. Maybe you are able to structure the existing information nicely, if that hasn’t been done before. Think about your audience If you want to write original content, you should think about your audience. What do you want to tell your audience? What’ll be the main message of your article? And what is the purpose? What do you want your audience to do after they’ve read your article? Do you want them to engage, to buy your stuff, to read more posts? Thinking about these questions will help you to come up with an original idea for your post or article. Learn how to set up a keyword strategy for your site in our Keyword research training »$ 99€ 99 - Buy now » Info Keyword research always comes first Although an original idea is a key element of writing an awesome and SEO-friendly article, every SEO strategy should start with proper keyword research. If you want to rank and to attract traffic to your site, you should focus your SEO strategy on those terms that people are searching for. You should try to get in people’s head and figure out which words they use for their searching. What questions do your audience have? There are a number of tools you can use to help you with your keyword research. If you execute your keyword research properly, you should end up with a long list of terms you want to be found for. This list should function as a guide for you to choose from. You should write content surrounding these keywords. A keyword is not yet a topic, though. You should make sure to come up with an original idea for your blog post. An idea in which the desired focus keyword could have a prominent place. Examples of great original content Writing original blog posts is the best way to drive traffic to your website. Providing you’ve done your keyword research well and you’re going after the terms that drive traffic to your site, original content can be a real boost for your rankings and your business. Above that, it’s a great way to show expertise in your specific niche to your audience. A great example of a blog with original content is the blog of Marike de Valk. Marike is a couples counselor (and my mother-in-law). She writes blog posts about relationships. Her posts show her expertise and authority in couples counseling. And -she knows which terms to tackle- generates lots of traffic and business. Relation therapy website: first post title “Women and criticism” ; second title “Wrong partner” Another great example of a blog with original content is Machu Picchu Travel. This site is owned by a Dutch woman and her partner (who is actually from Peru). They recently started selling tickets to the Inca Trail. As one of the owners of Machu Picchu Travel used to work as a guide on the Inca Trail, they have lots of stories, tons of beautiful pictures and all kinds of inside information to share with their audience. They started blogging some time ago. And that seemed to pay off! They attract more and more traffic to their website and sell lots of tickets (although they just started out!). Machu Picchu Travel: post title “Top 4 alternative Inca Trails” Content SEO: learn how to do keyword research, how to structure your site and how to write SEO friendly content »$ 19€ 19 - Buy now » Info Staying original versus wanting those clicks Your keyword research will thus give you ideas on what terms your articles should be focused. After that, it’s your job to write something original surrounding that specific keyword. It can be tempting, though, to write something that’s similar to what’s already been written by all these other bloggers. A few weeks ago, the Yoast SEO team (yes, we have our very own  SEO team) asked me to write something about SEO copywriting mistakes. The keyword ‘SEO copywriting mistakes’ is a keyword of which we think it will drive traffic to our site. I wrote the article and gave it the title : 5 SEO copywriting mistakes you should avoid. A very clickbaity title. I’m sure my article will rank and I’m also sure that people will click on that title. However, the post was not original. One of our readers commented on this post and mentioned the unoriginality. He was right. There are about 20 lists with SEO copywriting mistakes out there. And although at least two of my tips aren’t in any of the other lists, the post still was (a bit) unoriginal. Writing such a post every once in a while is fine and could help you generate clicks on the SERPs. However, if your content is unoriginal all of the time, your audience won’t come back to read any more of your posts. What to focus on next? Original content is the first thing you need to focus on in the process of writing a high-quality SEO friendly blog post. After you’ve made sure you have original content, you should focus on the readability of your post. Your idea could be totally original, but if you’re unable to write a decent text, your message will get lost. So, definitely make sure to write a text that is both easy as well as nice to read!

Many news sites report using the exact same content from the AP (Associated Press) and Rueters. Most don’t even take the time to add editorial notes. Wouldn’t the thousands of sites that use these articles all be releasing duplicate content? What do you suggest for us that report local and National news as the majority of our content? Thank you in advance for your advice. By Marieke van de Rakt on 19 October, 2016 I think you should never publish the exact same content. You always want to stand out from the crowd. I also understand that ‘breaking news’ travels fast and you do not have time to rewrite these news reports entirely. I would try to do a little rewriting. The ‘breaking news’ battle in Google will probably be won by major newssites anyway. Focussing on a well written piece (maybe with some extra information; background information) could be a way to draw a crowd that is searching for new information or another point of view about the matter. Does this answer your question? By PersianWhois on 19 October, 2016 Thank you for this article. Please write more about “Keyword researching” By Marieke van de Rakt on 19 October, 2016 Thanks! We’ll do our best to write some new articles about keyword research. In the mean time: https://yoast.com/keyword-research-ultimate-guide/ By Ken Kilpatrick on 21 October, 2016 I think the guy who whined about your article not being original probably still lives with his mom and has nothing to offer the world. I can just see his tired look about his bearded face as he awakes from the couch at 11 am to log on in search of criticizing good people like you who actually have a lot to contribute. Your point is not lost, though…I just thought this guy shouldn’t get away with thinking he’s a mini-me version of Chris Brogan… By windy voices on 24 October, 2016 Sometimes I got confuse when have to check the originality of my content because some of tools do not give the accurate result. What the best tool you use for that? Any suggestions? By Donna Young on 24 October, 2016 My experience shows that Copyscape.com is the best tool for that. By Marieke van de Rakt on 31 October, 2016 Orginal ideas can never be tested with a tool. You can check whether or not your content is ‘original’ or ‘unique’ with a tool.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches to Arrive by Early 2017 October 18, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Boom Supersonic Commercial Jets to Take Wing Garmin Loads Safety Features to its Fitness Trackers Load Safety Features via Strava Google’s hardware division has started its long-anticipated run with the Pixel devices. Like expected, they indeed are creating a buzz  all around, but it now appears that Google is going to vamp up to make the next noise. The latest reports centered on Google’s hardware output now bring the earlier rumored Google-made Smartwatches to the limelight. The smartwatch, said to be made with the touch of Google just like the Pixel smartphones, is now said to be making its way into the market by the early months of 2017. Besides, Google’s Smartwatches will also be arriving with the Android Wear 2.0 devices, which is now said to be making its debut along with the new hardware. The OS upgrade was expected to arrive earlier, but its delay does make sense considering that the debut will coincide with the new hardware product. The current revelation comes from noted tipster Evan Blass who has revealed that the Google will release two of its self-made Smartwatches by early 2017 with Android Wear 2.0 OS. There has been no specific release date announced, but going by word, we can expect the watches to make its debut in a public event as early as February. Google will be having two Smartwatches lined up for the launch next year, which are respectively codenamed Swordfish and Angelfish right now. Both of them will have the newly upgraded version 2.0 of Android Wear OS running inside the devices. Google is also said to load its Google Assistant personal assistant services in the Android Wear 2.0-powered Smartwatches.

Meet The Publisher Meet The Team Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Home Mobile Gadgets Trending Business Women & Tech Contests Overview: First look at Google’s new Pixel phones By: Gadjo Sevilla October 18, 2016 Text and photos Gadjo Cardenas Sevilla There was a time when Google was happy to just play partner with smartphone OEMs and provide software and guidance to further Android OS, that time is over. Google’s new Pixel and Pixel XL flagship smartphones are flying the #madebygoogle flag and are designed to target the very top of the smartphone food chain. The world has changed since Google began dominating the search engine space in 1998. Most people access the Internet through their mobile devices. Apps have taken over websites and Social Media is constantly in flux as companies like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and others try to make sense of what’s coming next. What hasn’t changed in the past decade is the reliance on smartphones. While the PC industry is experiencing all-time lows, smartphones are booming on a global scale and have pretty much become the de facto computing, communications and entertainment platforms for users of all ages. Google wants to jump the line into the future. It has figured out that smartphones are where they need to be and while yes, they created the most dominant smartphone platform in Android, they never really owned the whole experience. Until now. The 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL smartphones are Made by Google devices, while manufactured via HTC, they are built from the ground up to serve as the perfect vessels for the mobile future Google envisions. This mobile future transcends what we have today, which is an app-focused economy where scores of little icons on a smartphone represent a variety of applications and experiences. Google is going straight to the future and it sees the future as A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) and machine learning. The strategy is twofold, get the new Google Personal Assistant into people’s phones and into people’s homes. The phones part is evident in the Pixel devices, they can be trained to learn your voice, you no longer just ask questions using specific words as you did with Siri and Google Now, you can have actual conversations with your phone which can reply in context. More importantly, Google Assistant places voice at the centre of the interface making it possible to not just to dictate messages and replies but to launch apps, enable certain features, toggle settings and even set complex things in motion like booking reservations. Google Assistant is the Pixel’s defining feature that’s well executed. You can ask Google to play any song by any artist and it will scour various sources like YouTube and streaming services before delivering the song. The more you talk to the assistant, the better it understands you and the more proactive it gets. While Google’s Assistant coexists with various Android Apps we’re all used to, it’s not crazy to imagine a future beyond apps, where all we need to do is talk to our devices for specific information, or to create tasks and even to control everything from our cars, our homes and other accessories. The Pixel phones, the Google Home smart speaker and the technology that powers them are well positioned to take us to that future. Shot on Google Pixel XL As much as these devices are future facing and likely the link between Google’s web-based past into its mobile and always aware future, premium smartphones don’t sell on the promise of future features. This is why Google has imbued the Pixel and the larger Pixel XL with top tier features as well as a smartphone camera which it boasts is the best in the world. Going beyond the 12.3 megapixel sensor, multi-lens setup, Google’s camera is loaded with software advancements designed to get the best photos in any situation. I recently covered how rival Apple’s iPhone 7 is pushing the boundaries of photography. Google has managed not just to create one of the best cameras ever placed in an Android device, it can trade punches with the iPhone 7 in various aspects of photography and video. Google finally understands what Apple’s practiced all along, that by creating the hardware as well as the software in concert ensures a more cohesive and better product that will result in happier and more loyal users. The Pixel XL, like the smaller Pixel, is an accomplished feat. It really is the evolution of what Android and Nexus phones tried to build, but it is also a forward looking product that’s designed to introduce Google’s powerful software, A.I., and machine learning into our lives. Conclusion Does Google’s Pixel have what it takes to really make an impact in the market? That depends. It will be widely available in Canada at launch (it starts shipping on October 20th), but seems tied to specific carriers overseas. Google also lacks point-of-sale terminals or retail stores where reps can walk people through all the cool features, there’s also the issue of pricing. For Canadians, the Pixel starts at $899 for an unlocked base 32GB 5-inch model. While Google promises  indefinite free cloud storage for full-resolution photos and videos, that’s still a lot of money for what seems like an unknown quantity in the consumer market. After spending a long weekend with the Pixel XL, I get what Google is trying to do and I admire the boldness and steely resolve the company has shown in making its own phone, even if partner OEMs and other Android manufacturers may see it as an attack on their market share. Unfortunately, our review Google Pixel sporadically disconnected from our carrier network rendering it useless for calls or accessing the Internet. Our same SIM card worked without issue on five other devices. Google’s response was for us to contact our carrier, not really a helpful direction which dampens any enthusiasm I have in recommending the Google Pixel at this time.

Pixel by Google (Photo: Josmar Taveras, USA TODAY) Story Highlights Pixel by Google: $649 on up; store.google.com Pro. Google Assistant, excellent camera, free cloud photo storage, free support Pro. Daydream ready, fast USB-C charging Con. Not water resistant, only a single speaker. NEW YORK — Google's new Pixel phones should be on a smartphone shopper's short list — and not just for those disheartened by Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall. Pixel is a winner for anyone looking for an excellent phone. Start with cameras that are at the very least on par with the terrific cameras on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7, which represent its main competition. USA TODAY Google Pixel camera: Great but not revolutionary Add the baked-in voice-enabled Google Assistant, Google’s answer to Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa, where another battleground is poised to take place. Such digital assistants still represent a work in progress, including Google Assistant, but Google's voice brings a high IQ and a world of potential. Pixels are also the first phones in which Google took over all aspects of the hardware and software design (though HTC actually manufactured the units), borrowing from Apple’s playbook. Google Pixel XL, the larger version of Google's new Pixel smartphone.  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) Over the past several days, I’ve been testing the larger of the two Pixel models, the Pixel XL, which boasts a lovely Quad HD 5.5-inch display and costs $769 for 32 gigabytes of storage or $869 for 128 GB. The smaller Pixel has a Full HD 5-inch screen and costs $649 or $749, respectively. The phones are already on back order and will be available through Verizon (as the exclusive U.S. carrier), at Best Buy, via Google’s Project Fi or Google’s own Play Store. You can get an unlocked version that will work with any of the other major U.S. carriers. The timing for Google couldn't have been better, coming on the heels of Samsung's decision to stop making the Note 7, a high-end phablet that had attracted a fierce following but which was vulnerable to overheating and fire. The expanded recall may persuade some Android users to try a new brand. Here are the key takeaways: *Design: Pixels are crafted out of an aerospace-grade aluminum slab and glass and the XL model feels like the high-priced phone that it is. It's a tad shorter than the iPhone 7 Plus and, viewed from the front, the two phones look a fair bit alike, though from the rear not so much. The relatively wide bezels on the front appear to be mostly wasted real estate, as there are no physical buttons. On the upper third of the back, Pixel has a Gorilla Glass-covered glass shade that reveals smudges. What I do like is that there’s no camera bump as on most other phones — the rear lens and flash lie flat. The fingerprint sensor you can use to unlock the phone is also on the rear. And when you do unlock the devices, you can swipe down on the sensor to reveal notifications, a small but nice feature. The new fingerprint scanner on the back of the Google Pixel  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) Pixels run the latest version of Android called Nougat and with Google in charge, you ought to get software updates as soon as they are ready. The phone has a robust Qualcomm processor. And score one for Google against the iPhone 7: Pixel has the same standard 3.55mm headphone connector that the iPhone 7 got rid of and that every other smartphone I know has. Alas, there’s only a single speaker on Pixel; Apple added stereo speakers to the iPhone 7 and other smartphones also have them. And unlike the iPhone 7 or ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, you wouldn’t want to drop Pixel in a puddle. It is not fully water-resistant. Using the camera on Pixel. Photo by Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Staff ORG XMIT: RD xxxxx Baig_Google Pixel 10/17/2016 [Via MerlinFTP Drop]  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) *Camera. I detected only subtle differences between the pictures and videos I shot here (under all sorts of lighting conditions) and those I’ve captured on a Galaxy or the iPhone. Consider that high praise. I was impressed with the color and fine detail on most shots. The main rear camera on the Pixel is a 12.3-megapixel shooter with large pixels and an f/2.0 aperture (good in dim light). It is fast to fire. By double-twisting the phone, you can switch from the rear camera to the front 8-megapixel selfie camera or back, a trick that usually (but not always) worked. Maybe as important as the picture quality is what you can do with the images you capture. Google is giving Pixel owners unlimited free cloud storage at full resolution for all the pictures and videos shot with the phone, including 4K video. That’s a big deal. Google Assistant delivers the weather on a Google Pixel.  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) *Google Assistant: You can summon the Google Assistant by barking out “OK Google” or by pressing down and holding against the phone’s home key. As with other digital assistants, it can give you the basics: stock quotes, sports scores, even tell you a lame joke. But Google is pushing the conversational aspects of its AI-based Assistant further. You can tap contextual buttons that appear on the screen with suggested replies, or you can respond by voice. I asked Assistant to “tell me about my day” and it reported my local weather, told me what appointments I had coming and how long my commute would take. Without prompting, it then played radio broadcasts from NPR, Fox, News, Bloomberg and BBC. A Google Assistant search found photos of Edward Baig's daughter Sydney with a horse.  (Photo: Edward C. Baig) When I asked it to show me pictures of Sydney with horses, it correctly surmised that I meant my daughter, Sydney, rather than Sydney, Australia, and found pictures I'd taken of her with horses in my Google Photos stash. When I instead asked the Assistant to “show me pictures of Sydney with bridges” it pulled pictures of the Sydney Harbour Bridge off the Web. Google Assistant was able to translate “how do I find a bathroom in French?” into that language. Given the same query, Siri pointed me to the Web. To be fair, on some complicated requests, the Assistant also directed me to the Web. Google Assistant was able to identify songs where I knew only a few of the lyrics and played them, sometimes, through YouTube. There's a fun aspect to the Assistant, too. I could play trivia, or have Assistant flip a coin with the appropriate sound effect as I tried to guess heads or tails. Most promising is the idea that you can continue a conversation without repeating search parameters each step of the way. So you might ask it to find you an Italian restaurant. You can then can ask how late the place is open, without repeating the name of the restaurant or have Google Assistant find the menu. In my experience, however, such queries were hit-or-miss. Another example: I asked Google to show me pictures of dogs and it did so off the Web. Without mentioning dogs I followed up with "how about by the beach?" and Google surfaced Web images of canines by the beach. Impressive.

From there, you can request a callback from a support agent 24/7 or alternatively open a chat session (the hours are more limited). You can even remotely share your screen with the person helping you out. Pixel will be the first phone to support Google Daydream, but the mobile virtual-reality headset wasn't yet available for testing. Google's new phones are powerful, pricey and pretty darn intelligent and demonstrate Google's commitment to be a major player in the space.
