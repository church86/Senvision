UnGoogled Chromium Removes All the Googley Parts from Chromium GO UnGoogled Chromium available for free on GitHub & Softpedia Oct 16, 2016 22:30 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  UnGoogled Chromium is a custom version of the Chromium browser that doesn't include any type of Google services or features. UnGoogled Chromium is not a Google Chrome version, but a version of Chromium, the open-source browser which is at the base of Chrome, Vivaldi, and Opera. Chromium is not as Google-free as many people think While Chromium is an open-source project, it is a de-facto Google affair, with most contributors being Google engineers. As such, many of Chromium's features include many Google-specific services and aren't that agnostic as most people think. For example, Chromium comes pre-configured to use Google as the default search engine, uses Google's Safe Browsing API to scan every URL you visit, and loads a bunch of Google binaries to power all sorts of internal services. This means that there is a lot of user data still being sent to Google's servers, despite using an open-source project, and not Chrome. Developer exorcises Google from Chromium A developer named Eloston has set out to fix this, and has forked the Chromium source code so he can remove any traces of Google from the Chromium source code. In a GitHub README, he says he disabled the Safe Browsing API, WebRTC, the Omnibox address bar search feature, and any functionality specific to Google domains, such as Google Host Detector, Google URL Tracker, Google Cloud Messaging, Google Hotwording, and others. He also removed all closed-source binaries Google was loading into Chromium and made other stylistic changes, such as automatic URL formatting (UnGoogled Chromium does not hide https:// in the address bar anymore). Additionally, UnGoogled Chromium also forces popups to open into tabs and allows users to save data from more types of URL schemes (categories). Below is a photo gallery of UnGoogled Chromium. As you can see, it looks just like any other Chromium-based browser. UnGoogled Chromium is available for Ubuntu, Debian, Mac, and Windows.

Cantech Letter The Very Best of Canadian Science and Technology Home About Us Archive Currently Trending Cantech Investment Conference ||| ||| Wireless Interviews Software Lists and Data Cleantech Life Sciences Hardware Gaming Opinion Science Fintech Facebook and Google partner on undersea cable from the U.S. to Asia October 16, 2016 By Dylan Waddell 2 Comments Share this: Twitter0 Google+1 Facebook0 Facebook and Google are planning to run underwater fiber optic cables all the way from Hong Kong to Los Angeles California. This 8,000+ mile long track of cable will connect North America to Asia with the sole purpose of bringing better internet speeds. The cable will begin construction at some point this year and is expected to be completed and in operation by 2018. It’s predicted that the capacity will be 120 terabits per second, that’s over 15,300 gigabytes a second, extremely impressive compared to what’s currently available on the North American market. “These underwater cables will help increase the total bandwidth available not just to the giants that build them, but for pretty much everyone else as well. And they improve the resilience of the global internet by increasing the number of routes that data can travel across the oceans. But more to the point, they also give Facebook and Google more control over the infrastructure they depend on,” Klint Finley from Wired.com reports. Many in Eastern Canada will know that trans-Atlantic connections do not belong solely to this century, nor to the last for that matter. In the tiny town of Hearts Content on the eastern end of Newfoundland they will soon be celebrating the 150th anniversary of the first ever subsea cable. This is where the first ever transatlantic cable began and it ended in Valentia Islan, Ireland over 1900 miles away. With the introduction of Industrial Revolution-era cable the communication time between Europe and North America was altered drastically. Instead of messages taking upwards of a week to reach landfall in Europe, one could now be telegraphed across in nearly no time at all. Originally the telegraphs exchanged between the two points were a visual morse code. The system used lighting instead of the much more famous dots, dashes, and spaces we see in moves. Visual morse code required three people to convey the contents of a message and also a dark room to be able to see the light. Despite the strenuous methods of relaying messages, it was loved by the people everywhere as they could know in a near instant what was happening across the Atlantic Ocean, something we now take for granted. “These people were the first texters,” says Tara Bishop, an employee at the Heart’s Content Cable Museum. “It’s like us turning on a news network and watching the ticker tape running across the bottom of the screen of news headlines or stock markets. That’s what these people provided to the world,” But despite the popularity, the system was still very expensive, costing around 1 British Pound per word sent. But people quickly caught on and began shortening and combining words, a trend that continues even up until this day (LOL). “They were shortening words and combining words to make it more feasible to send their messages.” adds Bishop. Although this cable system has been disconnected since the 1960’s researchers are looking at using old subsea communication cables to help track temperatures and other information that could lead to a better understanding of climate change. But for now that dream is just slightly out of reach.

Were you one of the people inconvenienced by Samsung when they recalled all their Galaxy Note 7 units? Were you denied boarding your scheduled flight because you refused to turn in your Galaxy Note 7, which is now banned from all U.S. and Canadian aircraft? Or worse, did you witness, first-hand, your brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 unit catching on fire while you left it charging? Well, we forgive you; you didn’t know better. No one did, actually. We were all captured by the beautiful new Galaxy Note 7 that Samsung lured us with, not knowing it would bite us back in the end. So if you did turn over your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (if you haven’t, better do so now) or you’ve almost purchased one, then you might want to consider these other Android smartphones, which can even outdo some of the Galaxy Note 7’s features, and for a far better price, too. But of course, if you’re just going to pick up the new iPhone 7 Plus instead, by all means, do so. If you have been a fan of the Google Cardboard, then wait until you see Google’s new techie toy, the Google Pixel XL. If you don’t mind the 0.2 inches you’ll miss from the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, then you might take delight in this 5.5-inch Android smartphone. In fact, you’ll find that display is a little bit crisper since the display area is a bit smaller than that of the Galaxy Note 7’s. Google Pixel XL delivers–for a price. [Image by Google] In terms of a camera, you’re in for a treat. CNet reports that the Google Pixel XL’s 12.3 MP is a real winner. Camera-testing website DxOMark gave the Google Pixel XL’s camera a score of 89, the highest rating a smartphone camera has ever received. Apparently, one of the factors that really stood out is the camera’s outstanding Autofocus feature, which is extremely fast and accurate. The Google Pixel XL also runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, making it not only Google’s very first smartphone, but the very first to be compatible with Google’s new virtual reality system, Daydream. Forbes notes that the Google Pixel XL also promises a seven-hour battery life with just 15 minutes of charging time, although this, of course, will vary with continued usage. Although we did promise you a better price, the Google Pixel XL is not really a much cheaper alternative to the Galaxy Note 7. With its impeccable specs making this smartphone a premium phone to watch, setting you back $769 for the 32GB model is a fair price to pay. Wondering what’s the release date for the Google Pixel XL? The Google Pixel XL will be available in stores October 20. Another 5.5-inch smartphone that can easily bully the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is the Huawei P9 Plus, which is Huawei’s finest creation yet. Pocket-Lint played with the Huawei P9 Plus, and they’re returning with smiles on their faces. Packed with a Kirin 955 processor and a generous 4 GB RAM, you won’t need to worry about performance issues and data processing. And what’s more interesting is that despite its powerful core, the Huawei P9 Plus can run for two straight days on a single charge on normal usage. Huawei P9 Plus is a bigger and badder Huawei P9 [Image by Chainupong Hiporn / Shutterstock.com] In terms of camera, because everyone these days are just so obsessed with the camera, the Huawei P9 Plus comes strong and fierce. Fitted with a powerful Leica lens and offering an array of shooting modes, you’ll never go wrong with this one. Sold yet? Well, getting the Huawei P9 Plus will save you $200 from getting the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, so that’s a pretty good bargain given the top-notch features and performance the Huawei P9 Plus delivers. Another interesting unit that has been lurking in the shadows for a while now is the OnePlus 3. Also sporting a large 5.5-inch screen, a 1080p AMOLED display, and a whopping 6 GB RAM, the OnePlus 3 is a real smooth talker in terms of display and performance. According to Engadget, it comes with a customized OxygenOS, which provides a wide variety of customization and options that a real nit-picker will appreciate. OnePlus 3 is very competitive price wise. [Image by Esa Riutta / Shutterstock.com] While the camera of the OnePlus 3 won’t completely overpower that of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7’s, it’s a pretty decent player at 16 MP. With optimum image stabilization and excellent phase-detection autofocus, you can’t really complain. It’s pretty, it’s powerful, and most of all, it’s cheap. At $399, the OnePlus 3 will definitely deliver that bang for your buck. Are you considering these Galaxy Note 7 alternatives or will you stick around and wait for a new Samsung flagship that will supposedly knock your socks off?

 Google's nit-picky interview process is a huge turnoff for some experienced coders Julie Bort Oct. 16, 2016, 10:35 AM 100,425 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alphabet CEO Larry Page and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. AP Photo/Jeff Chiu By just about any measure, Google is one of the best companies a software programmer can work for, between its high pay, free food, playground of a campus, and the interesting tech it creates.  But in one important way, the company may have shot itself in the foot: its legendarily difficult interview process. Google is right now being sued on allegations of age discrimination by a couple of job candidates who didn't get offered a job there. Google is fighting the suit and calls the allegations "without merit." The suit may very well be without merit, but some programmers believe the company has designed its tough recruitment process to heavily favor those fresh from school with less real-world experience. In fact, that notorious interview process caused freelance programmer Michael Geary simply not to apply for a full-time job at Google even after he had worked as a contract programmer for the company for five years, he told Business Insider. Google knows he's a Google Maps expert Back in late 2007, Geary had been working at a startup called Zvents, a company which created local event calendars (it was later acquired by StubHub). freelance programmer Michael Geary Michael Geary His job was to build maps to events, so he had become an expert with programming using Google Maps. As a friendly, helpful fellow, he spent a lot of time on the Google Maps mailing list helping other programmers with their questions. Google took notice and hired him to help it build an election map for the 2oo8 presidential election. Although he lives near the Googleplex in Mountain View, he was attached to a team working in Washington, D.C. They liked his work and he enjoyed working with them, so he continued on a contract basis for another five years. At that point, Google pulled the project in-house. He faced a choice: apply to join Google, either with this team or another, or move on to another contract job. He opted to move on.  "I heard about this interview process," Geary said, "It seemed fine-tuned for people just out of college. When you are just out college, there's a lot of algorithms, and data structures and fast-thinking on a whiteboard, like you do in school. As opposed to real software engineering, there's a lot of other stuff that goes into that. In my real work, in 20 years, I've never used a whiteboard. I use my computer. But in job interviews they do it all the time." He said he feared the process would be "quizzes about algorithmic minutiae and having to code a red-black tree on the spot on a whiteboard — all things that favor recent CS grads." He's not alone in this attitude Earlier this week, a blog post went viral on Hacker News, a site where programmers chat about news of interest to them, from Pierre Gauthier, a man with 37 years of coding experience and 24 years of R&D director experience. Thomson Reuters Gauthier, founder and CEO of TWD Industries, wrote that he never applied to Google but was called and asked to apply for a director of engineering job. So he agreed to a phone interview. He posted the questions he was asked in the interview and the recruiter's reply, coupled with his inner monologue about it all. Basically, the recruiter was asking a list of technical questions and believed that there was only one "right" answer, he said. According to the blog post: "Google's representative stated that both management and up-to-date coding skills were required (a rare mix). But having exercised the former for more than 2 decades and the latter for almost 4 decades was not enough: I failed to give the 'right answers.'" His inner monologue basically shredded the recruiter's "right" answer to pieces, pointing out other technical solutions that were better. But perhaps the most famous story is how Google rejected a programmer named Max Howell in 2015. Howell is well known for creating a popular programming tool called Homebrew. Howell vented his frustration in a tweet that went viral. The tweet said, "Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*&k off." He later explained in another tweet, "I was rejected this morning. But it was a flippant tweet." Howell told Business Insider, "For me the situation was: Google really needed a plumber, so I turned up with 20 years of experience and all the right tools (some of which I'd developed myself), but then they insisted on quizzing me on fluid dynamics before they'd let me fix their leak." Happy endings Ironically, after Geary talked about not applying in a post on Hacker News last week, a product manager for the mapping team replied and told him that he did want to hire him and tried to get Google to fund the position, but got turned down. Geary says that not applying to Google back then, "could have been a mistake on my part," although he still has no intention of applying now. Meanwhile, Max Howell landed at Apple.  And Gauthier updated his blog post to say that after the post went viral, he received an outpouring of job offers (that he didn't need) and resumes of people wanting to come work for him. "Google cold-called me - I was not seeking a job. I founded TWD 18 years ago," he told us, adding that he believes his company's "'post-quantum' security technology is way ahead of today's academic R&D." When we asked Google to respond to criticism that its interview process favors new college grads, a spokesperson told us: "From hundreds of thousands of interviews, we hire thousands of engineers every year -- from new college grads to people with decades of experience. The process is well known to be rigorous, but we get consistently positive feedback from interviewees. Of course, with that many interviews taking place, there are some candidates who come away unhappy. We want more great people from a range of backgrounds and ages to apply to work here, so are very grateful for their feedback."

(Associated Press files) By ANICK JESDANUN, Associated Press Published: October 16, 2016, 6:05 AM A   A If you’re like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you’ve posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don’t have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple’s tools are part of last month’s iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories — and Google signaled recently that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: • APPLE’S MEMORIES. Apple’s new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple’s app created a “Florida to Illinois” package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a “Together” package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an “At The Beach” package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to “Related.” You can also add or delete images within Memories — in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let’s face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren’t necessarily ones I’d choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually … someday. • GOOGLE’S ASSISTANT. Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image. Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn’t require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes, such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called “Rediscover this day.” Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you’ll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. • SEARCHING. Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. • STORAGE. To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition — good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple’s iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos.

From Google Daydream to Google Assistant and more, here are the Android OS perks exclusive to the Pixel flagship phones.  ( Ramin Talaie | Getty Images ) Advertisement While most Android devices will soon operate on the upcoming Android 7.1 Nougat, only the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will run the full range of features that the new OS offers. Even Google's previous line of Nexus devices won't enjoy the upgrade as extensively as the company's new signature models will. And this just serves to heighten the unique appeal of the Pixel line. Here are the features exclusive to Android 7.1 Nougat for the Google Pixel flagship smartphones: Google Daydream VR The Pixel and Pixel XL are, in no small way, "phones built for virtual reality," according to Google. Being the first two to support Google's VR platform Daydream, the flagship devices will allow for an immersive 3D experience of movies, concerts and sporting events as though Pixel users were physically there. Daydream on Android 7.1 Nougat will also let them play games and explore new worlds. The Pixel phones will work with the Daydream View VR headset. Google Assistant Like the voice-activated Google Now, the new Google Assistant uses natural language commands. With an ability to understand nuances in communication, such as followup questions and humorous jabs, however, Google Assistant is touted as smarter and snazzier than Google Now. The new personal assistant can also make sense of items displayed on-screen to help users sort through their schedule and tasks, and conveniently launch third-party apps. To use Google Assistant on the Pixel smartphone, simply press down on the Home Button and say "OK Google" and the interface will switch to speech bubbles showing the conversation. Google Assistant may officially be exclusive to the Pixel smartphones, but that hasn't stopped other developers from editing into non-Pixel phones for these to run Google Assistant too.  Pixel Camera App With Unlimited Photo, Video Storage One of the highly celebrated features of the Google Pixel flagships is their camera — rated the best smartphone camera in the mobile phone industry thus far. The Pixel phones are equipped with a slew of camera tricks, which are embedded in the Pixel Camera app designed specifically for the devices. Among the Pixel Camera app features supported on Android 7.1 Nougat are Smart Burst, which is said to use artificial intelligence to choose the best out of a series of shots, and the default HDR+, which promises "zero shutter lag" even when taking rapid fire shots. The Smart Burst mode is not entirely a novel feature since it was included in the Nexus 6P last year, but Android 7.1 on the Pixel phones will carry the latest and greatest version. Retaining their original quality, photos and videos taken on Pixel phones will be safely stored on Google Photos without limit. Smart Storage Because the Pixel phones do not allow for memory expansion via a microSD card, the system will automatically remove photos and videos already saved in the Google Photos cloud storage. Pixel Launcher After having been renamed from Nexus Launcher to Pixel Launcher, the unique homescreen will (for now at least) be exclusive to the eponymous Pixel line. Google may, however, consider eventually porting it to Nexus devices, as some reports suggest. The main features we know so far: the Pixel Launcher will include new homescreen shortcuts and the circular app icons, and will also have users swiping up to access the app drawer from favorites. Customer Support 24/7 Google Pixel device owners who may run into a glitch can easily ask for assistance anytime — all thanks to the company's 24/7 customer support. From the Settings app, users can either text or call the help desk, and even share their screen with the customer assistant when walking through processes step by step. Android 7.1 Nougat Beta Release The new Android 7.1 Nougat firmware is included in the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones out of the box when the devices are released starting on Oct. 20. But the latest version of Nougat will also be released in beta for the Nexus line and other Android devices at the end of October.

The 21-year-old company, once a dominant force in Silicon Valley, is now close to sale, with final bids due Monday and observers expecting that the firm will be broken up. Experts say Yahoo committed fatal errors in the fast-paced, hypercompetitive tech world — it didn’t innovate fast enough, clung to a stale business model and failed to blow its own horn. “Part of what makes Silicon Valley an exciting place to be and to study is the amazing ability of many of the companies there to engage in effective self-promotion. Yahoo, possibly because of its performance problems and possibly because of its leadership changes, has really fallen down on that mark,” said Jo-Ellen Pozner, UC Berkeley Haas School of Business professor “There are ways to keep customers and investors and the public engaged in your story even if you’re not delivering. A little bit of hype really never hurt anybody, especially when your stock price is tanking,” she said. Instead, Yahoo has been steamrolled by Silicon Valley competitors Google and Facebook, which have grown to dominate digital advertising. The two are raking in 64 percent of online ad revenue in the U.S., according to Pivotal Research. Both firms are known for continuously rolling out new products and services and developing an impassioned user base. Meanwhile, Yahoo is expected to capture just 1.5 percent of the global digital ad market this year, down from 2.1 percent in 2015, according to digital advertising consultancy eMarketer. Yahoo’s travails are often laid at the door of CEO Marissa Mayer, who arrived from Google in 2012 to become Yahoo’s fourth CEO in four years. Mayer quickly went on a buying spree, spending more than $2 billion on dozens of companies. In 2013, Yahoo hired news anchor Katie Couric for more than $6 million a year and raised her compensation to $10 million last year. This year, Yahoo shuttered seven digital magazines and laid off more than 300 California workers as it seeks to cut 15 percent of its workforce by year’s end. When Mayer landed at Yahoo, the firm’s market capitalization — the combined value of all shares not owned by the corporation — stood at $25.9 billion and had climbed to $42.1 billion in 2014. The value fell precipitously last year to $34.9 billion. And in April, Yahoo announced its first-quarter revenue had fallen 18 percent to $859 million, the biggest quarterly drop since Mayer took over. It also suffered a $99 million quarterly loss and its market cap now stands at $35.8 billion. The company reports second-quarter earnings Monday, the same day final offers are expected. Bidders, according to reports based mostly on anonymous sources, include Verizon, AT&T, Quicken Loans co-founder Dan Gilbert backed by Warren Buffett, and private equity companies. Sale-price estimates hover around $6 billion. In its defense, Yahoo consistently points to its 1 billion monthly users and says its News and Finance sites are No. 1 in viewership in their categories, according to comScore ratings. But to many observers, expansive metrics don’t tell the real story. “Big numbers don’t necessarily mean success,” said Michael Malone, a journalist and longtime Silicon Valley watcher. “You can have a lot of users, a huge installed base, a huge market cap, but you’re dying of old age, you’re rotting from the inside. When was the last time anyone talked about Yahoo as interesting or compelling or innovative?” Companies perceived as interesting and innovative, such as Facebook and Google, have kept their product-focus sharp, while Yahoo has done the opposite, said Forrester Research analyst Shar VanBoskirk. The firm has spun out its offerings from search to a wide variety of products, from news to mail to video programming to hosting blogs. While Google has also wheeled out an array of products, its dominance in search gives consumers a strong touchpoint, VanBoskirk said. “The thing it (Google) did so well that Yahoo missed on is it stood for a clear utility and clear use,” VanBoskirk said. “The Yahoo brand doesn’t stand for anything anymore, which is their whole problem. They said, ‘We are going to be your all-purpose portal.’ “ Malone sees Yahoo’s business model as a throwback to the ’80s and ’90s. In contrast to Google’s ability to launch users wherever they want to go in the web, Yahoo is a “closed system,” Malone said. “You’re supposed to enter into this complete world where you get all the experiences you supposedly want,” he said. “They want to keep you in the castle.” To Pozner, Yahoo has essentially lost its Silicon Valley mojo, and with it, the interest of an otherwise tech-obsessed public and its ability to lure tech talent. “The company has been mining its existing customer base and not necessarily providing new value to attract new customers,” Pozner said. “Once the organization stops being known for innovation, then it stops attracting the people who are excited by innovation.” However, Yahoo still generates affection, even among people who seldom interact with it, and that loyalty may be an attractive asset in the company’s sale, VanBoskirk said. “It’s a funny thing. Even if people don’t use Yahoo a lot or know what the brand stands for, they like it. They root for it. They feel kind of warm and fuzzy to the brand, even after it’s reached its point of uselessness.” Contact Ethan Baron at 408-920-5011 or follow him at Twitter.com/ethanbaron.

Google will shut down Panoramio on November 4, the location-centric photo sharing service which the company acquired in 2007. It also added that Panoramio will be a redundant platform since its functions are already being provided by Google Maps and the company's Local Guides program. Reports claim that the announcement is just the latest effort by the company to position Maps as a social platform and primary discovery tool, thereby making it more appealing to advertisers and marketers. Google had made the announcement back in 2014 but postponed the shutdown until it could add more features to Google Maps. Also, the outcry from over 100 million users was stupendous. Panoramio will now enter a “read-only” mode for one year, where the upload tool will be disabled but users will have access to their earlier images. Users will also be allowed to export their images. But, both the export option and syncing with Google Album Archives will be available for one year. After November 4, 2017, all accounts will be deleted. Google is also encouraging users to link their Panoramio account to their Google+ profile, which will automatically save photos from the defunct platform to the Google Album Archive, without using up the storage quota.

(Sean Proctor/The New York Times)   By Quentin Hardy The New York Times Oct. 16, 2016   Today’s Business stories Festive farming: Harvest time comes for Willamette Valley Christmas tree growers For some, pets at work take edge off ‘ruff’ days Tiny-home market more bust than boom Business Datebook Business Beat More Business »   Jason Mars is an African-American professor of computer science who also runs a tech startup. When his company’s artificially intelligent smartphone app talks, he said, it sounds “like a helpful, young Caucasian female.” “There’s a kind of pressure to conform to the prejudices of the world” when you are trying to make a consumer hit, he said. “It would be interesting to have a black guy talk, but we don’t want to create friction, either. First we need to sell products.” Mars’ startup is part of a growing high-tech field called conversational computing. This technology is being popularized by programs such as the Siri system in Apple’s iPhone, and Alexa, which is built into the Echo, Amazon’s artificially intelligent home computing device. Conversational computing is holding a mirror to many of society’s biggest preconceptions around race and gender. Listening and talking are the new input and output devices of computers. But they have social and emotional dimensions never seen with keyboards and screens. Do we, for example, associate the stereotypical voice of an English butler — think of Jarvis the computer in “Iron Man” — with a helpful and intelligent person? And why do so many people want to hear a voice that sounds like it came from a younger woman with no discernible accent? Choosing a voice has implications for design, branding or interacting with machines. A voice can change or harden how we see each other. Where commerce is concerned, that creates a problem: Is it better to succeed by complying with a stereotype, or risk failure in the market by going against type? Considering gender For many, the answer is initially clear. Microsoft’s artificially intelligent voice system is Cortana, for example, and it was originally the voice of a female character in the video game “Halo.” “In our research for Cortana, both men and women prefer a woman, younger, for their personal assistant, by a country mile,” said Derek Connell, senior vice president for search at Microsoft. In other words, a secretary — a job that is traditionally seen as female. This month, Google introduced a number of voice-based products, including Google Home, its version of Echo. All of them use Google Assistant, which also speaks in tones associated with a young, educated woman. Google Assistant “is a millennial librarian who understands cultural cues, and can wink at things,” said Ryan Germick, who leads the personality efforts in building Google Assistant. “Products aren’t about rational design decisions. They are about psychology and how people feel.” The company has had internal debates about whether to respond differently on questions to the computer about suicide, Connell said. “We’ve leaned to providing information about suicide prevention everywhere,” he said, as opposed to offering no advice at all. But sometimes, if you want people to figure out quickly that they are talking to a machine, it can be better to have a man’s voice. For example, IBM’s Watson, when it talks to Bob Dylan in television commercials, has a male voice. When Ashok Goel, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, adapted Watson to have a female voice as an informal experiment in how people relate to conversational machines, his students couldn’t tell it was a computer. But Watson’s maleness is the exception. Amazon’s A.I. technology is another in the comforting female voice camp. “Alexa was always an assistant, and female,” said Peng Shao, who worked at Amazon on the Echo and is now at a Seattle startup, building another speech-based A.I. system. Amazon would not comment on its product. “You need a persona” Gender is just the starting point. Can your A.I. technology understand accents? And can it respond in a way that feels less robotic and at least mimics some sort of human empathy? “You need a persona,” Shao said. “It’s a very emotional thing — people would get red, even get violent, if it didn’t understand them. When it did understand them, it felt like magic. They sleep next to them. This is heading for hospitals, senior care, a lot of sensitive places.” Capital One developed a banking app on Alexa, and found it had to dial down the computer’s formality to make people comfortable talking about their finances with a computer. “Money is inextricably linked to emotion, enabling and preventing things in your life,” said Stephanie Hay, the head of content strategy, culture and A.I. design at Capital One. At first the app said, “Hello,” but that seemed too tense. “ ‘Hi, there’ worked better,” she said. “She’s my friend, hanging out with me in the kitchen. I need her to be reliable and approachable, but not invasive.” We don’t just need that computerized voice to meet our expectations, said Justine Cassell, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. We need computers to relate to us and put us at ease when performing a task. “We have to know that the other is enough like us that it will run our program correctly,” she said. That need seems to start young. Cassell has designed an avatar of indeterminate race and gender for 5-year-olds. “The girls think it’s a girl, and the boys think it’s a boy,” she said. “Children of color think it’s of color, Caucasians think it’s Caucasian.” Another system she built spoke in what she termed “vernacular” to African-­American children, achieving better results in teaching scientific concepts than when the computer spoke in standard English. When tutoring the children in a class presentation, however, “we wanted it to practice with them in ‘proper English.’ Standard American English is still the code of power, so we needed to develop an agent that would train them in code switching,” she said. And, of course, there are regional issues to consider when creating a robotic voice. For Cortana, Microsoft has had to tweak things like accents, as well as languages, and the jokes Cortana tells for different countries. If a French driver goes into Germany using driving directions voiced by Nuance Communications, the computer will mispronounce the name of a German town with a French accent. The idea is to keep the driver confident by sustaining the illusion that the computer is French. Mars’ company, called Clinc, makes personal financial smartphone software that answers questions like “how much can I spend on a computer?” It relies on a similar Google-created female voice. He is hoping for enough success that he can eventually test and counter stereotypes with unexpected A.I. voices. “You need to be at a certain size before you can address these questions,” said Mars, who teaches at the University of Michigan. But maybe not too big. “I think consumers will eventually be open to exploring different voices and types,” he said. “Companies, they’ll probably stay conservative about it.” More Business articles »     RG Daily Digest Get our top headlines delivered to your inbox.         Today’s Business stories Business Festive farming: Harvest time comes for Willamette Valley Christmas tree growers Business For some, pets at work take edge off ‘ruff’ days Business Tiny-home market more bust than boom Business Apple shows  it’s out of touch Business Business Datebook Business Business Beat     Opinion Editorial The aftermath of Measure 97 Voters sent a clear message last week to proponents of state Measure 97, which would have taxed sales of about 1,000 companies doing business in Oregon.

They don’t have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video – and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple’s tools are part of last month’s iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories – and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: Apple’s Memories Apple’s new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file – so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple’s app created a “Florida to Illinois” package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a “Together” package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an “At The Beach” package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to “Related.” You can also add or delete images within Memories – in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let’s face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren’t necessarily ones I’d choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually … someday. Google’s Assistant Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout. Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so they resemble a moving image. Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady – without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation – although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn’t require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes, such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called “Rediscover this day.” Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you’ll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. Searching Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. Storage To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition – good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple’s iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos.

I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google's choices aren't necessarily ones I'd make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called "Rediscover this day." Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you'll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. Searching Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple's version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. Storage To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you're online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition -- good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple's iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos. © 2016 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Google’s new “Fact check” tag — which joins other categories the search giant uses to distinguish certain posts within the endless sea of internet content such as “Highly Cited” and “Opinion” — aims “to help readers find fact checking in large news stories,” according to a blog post. In the post, Google Head of News Richard Gingras explained some of the logic in determining which stories get the “Fact check” tag. Also Read: Donald Trump Says Google Is 'Suppressing' Negative Hillary Clinton News “Google News determines whether an article might contain fact checks in part by looking for the schema.org ClaimReview markup,” he wrote. “We also look for sites that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks.” Google already uses algorithms to give certain sources preference in its search rankings, which drives a significant percentage of total internet traffic. However, the company hasn’t previously called out false news stories in any way or appeared to make overt political judgments, although Donald Trump has accused the search engine of “suppressing” bad news about Hillary Clinton. var googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || []; googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/30981161/TheWrapRemnantOOP', 'div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0').addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0'); }); Earlier this year, former Facebook employees admitted that human curators deliberately prevented news from right-wing sources from trending in its News Feed Also Read: Jon Voight Backs Donald Trump's Google Conspiracy Theory (Video) “We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” Gingras wrote.

Foreign spies hacked Australian agency, report says by Staff Writers Sydney (AFP) Oct 12, 2016 Government data requests up 10 percent: Google Washington (AFP) Oct 12, 2016 - Google said Wednesday that data requests from governments around the world hit a record high in the six months ending in June, extending a steady rise. The 44,943 requests amounted to a 10 percent increase from the prior six-month period and a fourth consecutive increase, Google said in its "transparency report." The official requests related to 76,713 user accounts in the latest period, down from 81,311 in the second half of 2015. Google provided at least some data in response to 64 percent of the requests in 2016, unchanged from the previous reporting period. The number of requests to Google has been generally rising since it began releasing transparency data in 2011. The online giant, like other tech firms, maintains that it protects user privacy while cooperating with lawful requests from police and other official agencies. "As we have noted in the past, when we receive a request for user information, we review it carefully and only provide information within the scope and authority of the request," Google law enforcement director Richard Salgado said in a blog post. "Before producing data in response to a government request, we make sure it strictly follows the law, for example to compel us to disclose content in criminal cases we require the government use a search warrant, and that it complies with Google's strict policies (to prevent overreach that can compromise users' privacy)." In the latest report, the United States had the largest number of requests at 14,169, with data supplied in 79 percent of those cases. Germany was second with 8,788 requests, followed by France (4,300), India (3,452) and Britain (3,302). The company said it received its first-ever requests from Algeria, Belarus, the Cayman Islands, El Salvador, Fiji and Saudi Arabia in 2016. Google did not agree to provide data in any of those requests, according to the report. Foreign spies installed malicious software on an Australian government agency's computer system, stealing an unknown number of documents, an official report revealed Wednesday, stopping short of naming the country involved. The security breach on the Bureau of Meteorology's system, which has connections to the defence department, was detected in 2015 and initial media reports linked it to China. China has previously been accused of hacking websites run by the US government and by private firms. In 2013 Chinese hackers were accused of stealing the top-secret blueprints of Australia's new intelligence agency headquarters. The government's Australian Cyber Security Centre report released Wednesday attributed "the primary compromise to a foreign intelligence service" but did not name any country as responsible. "We don't narrow it down to specific countries, and we do that deliberately," said Dan Tehan, who assists Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on cyber security. "But what we have indicated is that cyber espionage is alive and well," he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The report said the national cyber security agency, Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), had identified the presence of Remote Access Tool (RAT) malware "popular with state-sponsored cyber adversaries" and other malware associated with cyber crime on the weather bureau's system in 2015. "The RAT had also been used to compromise other Australian government networks," it said. "ASD identified evidence of the adversary searching for and copying an unknown quantity of documents from the Bureau's network. This information is likely to have been stolen by the adversary." The report also said while the threat of a cyber attack against Australia's government, infrastructure and industry had grown in recent years, the risk from terrorist groups was low for now. "Apart from demonstrating a savvy understanding of social media and exploiting the internet for propaganda purposes, terrorist cyber capabilities generally remain rudimentary and show few signs of improving significantly in the near future," it said.

A fact-check feature will appear as a tag among Google news search results, alongside established labels for "highly cited," "in-depth" and "opinion." Sites deemed nonpartisan and meeting the criterion of a fact-checking service can apply for the label. “We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” Google said in a blog post Friday. No shortage of claims and counter-claims have plagued the veracity of comments on a wide range of issues in the general election pitting Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump. Most major media outlets now routinely run short, fact-checking features and some networks, such as CNN, parenthetically insert headlines verifying or challenging a candidate's claims. For Google, which has tinkered with the idea for years, it's been "an ambition of the founders to be able to provide instant access to facts to respond to statements or claims being made by politicians and public figures," says Greg Sterling, a contributing editor at Search Engine Land. Facebook, which holds considerable sway in how Americans receive their news, has yet to employ a fact-checking feature. The social-networking giant recently landed itself in hot water when its algorithm promoted fake news. Follow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.

Julian Chokkattu Digital TrendsOctober 15, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google unveiled a slew of devices at its October 4 event, and two of them are smartphones — the Pixel and Pixel XL. You can pre-order both devices right now (if they’re in stock) and they’ll be available on October 20. The smartphone market is saturated with big displays, but those who want smaller handsets usually must settle for budget or mid-tier specifications. There are exceptions, of course, like the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and the iPhone SE, but flagship small smartphones are few and far between. Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — Oh my! Everything Google revealed at its Oct. 4 event In comes Google’s Pixel, which shares nearly the exact same specifications as the bigger Pixel XL while retaining a 5-inch display. Last year’s 5.2-inch Nexus 5X was not nearly as powerful as the Nexus 6P, and that’s why it had a lower price tag. With the Pixel, you can finally expect flagship specs on a small display. You’re also getting the very best of Android — and near perfect hardware and software integration. Unlike the Nexus lineup, Google handpicked specific parts from HTC — like how Apple uses Foxconn to manufacture the iPhone. Tighter integration between Android OS and the hardware can make all the difference. Below is our breakdown and analysis of the Nexus 5X and the Pixel, which can help you decide if you should cough up the dough to join Google’s new lineup. Performance Google Pixel Nexus 5X Size 143.8 × 69.5 × 7.3mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 inches) 147 x 72.6 x 7.9mm (5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 inches) Weight 5.04 ounces (143 grams) 4.80 ounces (135 grams) Screen 5-inch AMOLED 5.2-inch IPS LCD Resolution 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (441 ppi) 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (423 ppi) OS Android 7.1 Android 7.0 (upgradeable to Android 7.1) Storage 32, 128GB 16, 32GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 RAM 4GB 2GB Connectivity 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Camera 12.3MP rear, 8MP front 12.3MP rear, 5MP front Video 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 120, 60 or 30fps, 720p at 240fps 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30fps, 720p at 120fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor Water resistant Yes, IP53 rated No Battery 2,770mAh 2,700mAh Ports USB Type-C USB Type-C Marketplace Google Store Google Store Color offerings Blue, silver, black Black, white, blue Availability AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Project Fi AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Project Fi Price $650 $350~ DT review Pending – Hands on here 2.5/5 stars It may look like the Pixel and the Nexus 5X share similar specs — they do, but the Pixel has a leg up where it really matters. Notably, it comes with the latest and greatest from Qualcomm — the Snapdragon 821. This processor supposedly offers a 10 percent increase in performance over the Snapdragon 820, which powered most of this year’s flagships, such as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, the LG G5, and the HTC 10. In comparison, the Pixel is well ahead of the Snapdragon 808 processor in the Nexus 5X. You won’t have issues with daily tasks like web browsing, but you will see performance hiccups when doing slightly processor-heavy tasks, like playing Pokémon Go. Not to mention the 5X only has 2GB of RAM — it truly shows when you try to multi-task with several apps. The Pixel has 4GB of RAM and it’s better optimized to run Android, so you shouldn’t run into any issues. The newer device also has better storage options, offering a standard 32GB and a 128GB model, whereas the 5X only comes with options for 16GB and 32GB of internal storage. Both devices also feature a fingerprint sensor. Winner: Pixel Design and durability Google’s latest phone is slightly smaller than the 5.2-inch Nexus 5X, but it’s also a little heavier — that’s thanks to the all-metal build, making the Pixel feel like a high-end device. The 5X is made of hard polymer plastic. Metal is better, but half of the Pixel’s back is glass, which may not make it as durable as the 5X — that’s double the glass you may have to repair. And the glass back is one of the more unique design choices for the Pixel, which mostly looks like an iPhone. The glass is sure to attract fingerprints, but we’re not fans of the front due to the larger-than-usual bottom bezel. The Nexus 5X, on the other hand, has slim bezels, a sleek back with the stylish Nexus brand name, and a front-facing speaker — though it’s not too powerful. The Pixel’s speaker will likely be a little louder, even if there’s only a single, bottom-firing one. Design is subjective, and we like the Pixel’s look but the Nexus 5X may edge out here. The metal build may also protect your Pixel a little more, but the glass on the back is has us worried that you may face a higher repair cost if you drop the device. Winner: Nexus 5X  Display The Pixel’s 5-inch display still holds the same resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, but it has a higher pixel density at 441 pixels-per-inch — you will hardly be able to tell the difference. What will be easily noticeable is the screen as the Pixel has an AMOLED display, and the Nexus 5X uses an LCD one. The Pixel’s screen will likely be brighter and offer deeper blacks, as well as sharper colors. Winner: Pixel Battery The Pixel XL may feature a sizable difference in battery capacity, but that doesn’t mean the Pixel won’t be able to last you a day. Google claims the Pixel will give you up to 13 hours of internet use on LTE — that’s the same as Apple’s claim for the iPhone 7 Plus, and an hour more than the iPhone 7. Read More Compared to the Nexus 5X, you’ll get five more hours of battery life using internet on LTE with the Pixel. It’s surprising, considering the two have similar batteries. The Pixel has a 2,770mAh battery and the 5X has a 2,700mAh one. The key is software and hardware optimization, and while we doubt we’ll actually get 13 hours of internet use on LTE for the Pixel, you can certainly expect a sizable bump of juice for the device. Winner: Pixel Camera Google’s proud of what it’s done with the Pixel’s camera — it has received the highest score on DXOMark for a smartphone. Google says it rebuilt the experience from the ground up — there’s no optical-image-stabilization, but the search giant has a proprietary gyro-based stabilization software for videos. Google has also improved HDR+ processing, meaning the photo is captured much faster and it also processes incredibly fast. Not to mention that Google says its 12.3-megapixel rear camera on the Pixel has one of the fastest launch to capture times. Compared to the Nexus 5X, we can say this is true thanks to our brief time with the devices at the San Francisco event. The camera on the Pixel also has a few exclusive features, such as white balance presets, exposure compensation, automatic exposure and automatic focus locking, and viewfinder grid modes. If you own a Pixel, you’ll also get free unlimited photo storage in Google Photos at full resolution. This option already exists in the app, but storing at full resolution will eat up Google account storage space for non-Pixel owners. The front-facing camera is packed with 8-megapixels, more than the 5X. Winner: Pixel Software The Nexus 5X will get Android 7.1 Nougat in December, but the Pixel comes with it pre-installed. That means Pixel owners will have early access to new features like Night Light, a night mode; App Shortcuts, similar to iOS’ 3D Touch; improved touch latency; fingerprint gestures that allow you to swipe down to bring down the notification drawer; Daydream VR support, and Seamless A/B Updates. And there are a few Pixel-exclusive features that Nexus 5X owners will not enjoy at all, notably Google Assistant. Press and hold the home button, and you’ll find Google Assistant come up, asking what you need help with. The Assistant can run search queries, order an Uber, and more. The feature may end up on Nexus phones as Google is “exploring” ways to implement it, but it’s unlikely it will come any time soon. There’s also Smart Storage, which automatically removes backed up photos from your device, and the Pixel Launcher won’t be available on the Play Store — there are ways to implement a similar look via third-party launchers, though. You also get 24/7 support built into the phone, complete with screen sharing in case you ever run into an issue. You can learn more about the differences between Android 7.1 Nougat in the Pixel and other Android devices here. Google’s Pixel smartphones are the future, so it’s certain they will endure longer-lasting support than the 5X. Winner: Pixel Pricing and availability The Pixel is a better phone, but we’re also comparing a device that has superior internals to one with mid-range specs. The Nexus 5X debuted for a little under $400, but you can easily find it online for prices ranging from $200 to $300. The Pixel, on the other hand, starts at $650 for the 32GB variant. Google’s asking for a lot more, but it does offer the specs, build, and optimization to match the high cost. The Nexus 5X isn’t sold on the Google Store anymore, but it’s still available from third-party retailers as well as on Project Fi. The Pixel is available for pre-order via Verizon, the Google Store, Best Buy, and Project Fi — you’ll be able to pay the full price or get on the device financing plan for no-interest monthly payments. It may be out of stock at the moment, though. Winner: Nexus 5X Winner: Pixel If you’re on a budget, there are more powerful smartphones you can get for a lower price than the Pixel, and the Nexus 5X is still a decent choice. You shouldn’t even be thinking about a Pixel, as it’s meant to be a high-end smartphone competing with the likes of Samsung and Apple. Still, no-interest device financing options are a plus and you’re getting the latest and greatest of Android, with fast updates and 24/7 support. You’re getting a superior camera, battery, display, vastly improved performance, and the kind of software and hardware integration we have never seen before on Android. What’s more enticing may be the fact that the Pixel may be one of the few high-performing 5-inch Android smartphones, and that’s certain to win over many of you.

By Julian Chokkattu — October 15, 2016 12:50 PM Subscribe to this topic Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Samsung Galaxy S7 edge MSRP $799.99 DT Editors' Choice Learn More Also mentioned LG Nexus 5X Google unveiled a slew of devices at its October 4 event, and two of them are smartphones — the Pixel and Pixel XL. You can pre-order both devices right now (if they’re in stock) and they’ll be available on October 20. The smartphone market is saturated with big displays, but those who want smaller handsets usually must settle for budget or mid-tier specifications. There are exceptions, of course, like the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and the iPhone SE, but flagship small smartphones are few and far between. Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — Oh my! Everything Google revealed at its Oct. 4 event In comes Google’s Pixel, which shares nearly the exact same specifications as the bigger Pixel XL while retaining a 5-inch display. Last year’s 5.2-inch Nexus 5X was not nearly as powerful as the Nexus 6P, and that’s why it had a lower price tag. With the Pixel, you can finally expect flagship specs on a small display. You’re also getting the very best of Android — and near perfect hardware and software integration. Unlike the Nexus lineup, Google handpicked specific parts from HTC — like how Apple uses Foxconn to manufacture the iPhone. Tighter integration between Android OS and the hardware can make all the difference. Below is our breakdown and analysis of the Nexus 5X and the Pixel, which can help you decide if you should cough up the dough to join Google’s new lineup. Performance Google Pixel Nexus 5X Size 143.8 × 69.5 × 7.3mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 inches) 147 x 72.6 x 7.9mm (5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 inches) Weight 5.04 ounces (143 grams) 4.80 ounces (135 grams) Screen 5-inch AMOLED 5.2-inch IPS LCD Resolution 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (441 ppi) 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (423 ppi) OS Android 7.1 Android 7.0 (upgradeable to Android 7.1) Storage 32, 128GB 16, 32GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 RAM 4GB 2GB Connectivity 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Camera 12.3MP rear, 8MP front 12.3MP rear, 5MP front Video 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 120, 60 or 30fps, 720p at 240fps 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30fps, 720p at 120fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor Water resistant Yes, IP53 rated No Battery 2,770mAh 2,700mAh Ports USB Type-C USB Type-C Marketplace Google Store Google Store Color offerings Blue, silver, black Black, white, blue Availability AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Project Fi AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Project Fi Price $650 $350~ DT review Pending – Hands on here 2.5/5 stars It may look like the Pixel and the Nexus 5X share similar specs — they do, but the Pixel has a leg up where it really matters. Notably, it comes with the latest and greatest from Qualcomm — the Snapdragon 821. This processor supposedly offers a 10 percent increase in performance over the Snapdragon 820, which powered most of this year’s flagships, such as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, the LG G5, and the HTC 10. In comparison, the Pixel is well ahead of the Snapdragon 808 processor in the Nexus 5X. You won’t have issues with daily tasks like web browsing, but you will see performance hiccups when doing slightly processor-heavy tasks, like playing Pokémon Go. Not to mention the 5X only has 2GB of RAM — it truly shows when you try to multi-task with several apps. The Pixel has 4GB of RAM and it’s better optimized to run Android, so you shouldn’t run into any issues. The newer device also has better storage options, offering a standard 32GB and a 128GB model, whereas the 5X only comes with options for 16GB and 32GB of internal storage. Both devices also feature a fingerprint sensor. Winner: Pixel Design and durability Google’s latest phone is slightly smaller than the 5.2-inch Nexus 5X, but it’s also a little heavier — that’s thanks to the all-metal build, making the Pixel feel like a high-end device. The 5X is made of hard polymer plastic. Metal is better, but half of the Pixel’s back is glass, which may not make it as durable as the 5X — that’s double the glass you may have to repair. And the glass back is one of the more unique design choices for the Pixel, which mostly looks like an iPhone. The glass is sure to attract fingerprints, but we’re not fans of the front due to the larger-than-usual bottom bezel. The Nexus 5X, on the other hand, has slim bezels, a sleek back with the stylish Nexus brand name, and a front-facing speaker — though it’s not too powerful. The Pixel’s speaker will likely be a little louder, even if there’s only a single, bottom-firing one. Design is subjective, and we like the Pixel’s look but the Nexus 5X may edge out here. The metal build may also protect your Pixel a little more, but the glass on the back is has us worried that you may face a higher repair cost if you drop the device. Winner: Nexus 5X  Display The Pixel’s 5-inch display still holds the same resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, but it has a higher pixel density at 441 pixels-per-inch — you will hardly be able to tell the difference. What will be easily noticeable is the screen as the Pixel has an AMOLED display, and the Nexus 5X uses an LCD one. The Pixel’s screen will likely be brighter and offer deeper blacks, as well as sharper colors. Winner: Pixel Battery The Pixel XL may feature a sizable difference in battery capacity, but that doesn’t mean the Pixel won’t be able to last you a day. Google claims the Pixel will give you up to 13 hours of internet use on LTE — that’s the same as Apple’s claim for the iPhone 7 Plus, and an hour more than the iPhone 7. Compared to the Nexus 5X, you’ll get five more hours of battery life using internet on LTE with the Pixel. It’s surprising, considering the two have similar batteries. The Pixel has a 2,770mAh battery and the 5X has a 2,700mAh one. The key is software and hardware optimization, and while we doubt we’ll actually get 13 hours of internet use on LTE for the Pixel, you can certainly expect a sizable bump of juice for the device. Winner: Pixel Camera Google’s proud of what it’s done with the Pixel’s camera — it has received the highest score on DXOMark for a smartphone. Google says it rebuilt the experience from the ground up — there’s no optical-image-stabilization, but the search giant has a proprietary gyro-based stabilization software for videos. Google has also improved HDR+ processing, meaning the photo is captured much faster and it also processes incredibly fast. Not to mention that Google says its 12.3-megapixel rear camera on the Pixel has one of the fastest launch to capture times. Compared to the Nexus 5X, we can say this is true thanks to our brief time with the devices at the San Francisco event. The camera on the Pixel also has a few exclusive features, such as white balance presets, exposure compensation, automatic exposure and automatic focus locking, and viewfinder grid modes. If you own a Pixel, you’ll also get free unlimited photo storage in Google Photos at full resolution. This option already exists in the app, but storing at full resolution will eat up Google account storage space for non-Pixel owners. The front-facing camera is packed with 8-megapixels, more than the 5X. Winner: Pixel Software The Nexus 5X will get Android 7.1 Nougat in December, but the Pixel comes with it pre-installed. That means Pixel owners will have early access to new features like Night Light, a night mode; App Shortcuts, similar to iOS’ 3D Touch; improved touch latency; fingerprint gestures that allow you to swipe down to bring down the notification drawer; Daydream VR support, and Seamless A/B Updates. And there are a few Pixel-exclusive features that Nexus 5X owners will not enjoy at all, notably Google Assistant. Press and hold the home button, and you’ll find Google Assistant come up, asking what you need help with. The Assistant can run search queries, order an Uber, and more. The feature may end up on Nexus phones as Google is “exploring” ways to implement it, but it’s unlikely it will come any time soon. There’s also Smart Storage, which automatically removes backed up photos from your device, and the Pixel Launcher won’t be available on the Play Store — there are ways to implement a similar look via third-party launchers, though. You also get 24/7 support built into the phone, complete with screen sharing in case you ever run into an issue. You can learn more about the differences between Android 7.1 Nougat in the Pixel and other Android devices here. Google’s Pixel smartphones are the future, so it’s certain they will endure longer-lasting support than the 5X. Winner: Pixel Pricing and availability The Pixel is a better phone, but we’re also comparing a device that has superior internals to one with mid-range specs. The Nexus 5X debuted for a little under $400, but you can easily find it online for prices ranging from $200 to $300. The Pixel, on the other hand, starts at $650 for the 32GB variant. Google’s asking for a lot more, but it does offer the specs, build, and optimization to match the high cost. The Nexus 5X isn’t sold on the Google Store anymore, but it’s still available from third-party retailers as well as on Project Fi. The Pixel is available for pre-order via Verizon, the Google Store, Best Buy, and Project Fi — you’ll be able to pay the full price or get on the device financing plan for no-interest monthly payments. It may be out of stock at the moment, though. Winner: Nexus 5X Winner: Pixel If you’re on a budget, there are more powerful smartphones you can get for a lower price than the Pixel, and the Nexus 5X is still a decent choice. You shouldn’t even be thinking about a Pixel, as it’s meant to be a high-end smartphone competing with the likes of Samsung and Apple. Still, no-interest device financing options are a plus and you’re getting the latest and greatest of Android, with fast updates and 24/7 support. You’re getting a superior camera, battery, display, vastly improved performance, and the kind of software and hardware integration we have never seen before on Android. What’s more enticing may be the fact that the Pixel may be one of the few high-performing 5-inch Android smartphones, and that’s certain to win over many of you.

Rooting a phone lets you take more control over the software running on it, from loading apps that dig deeper into the settings of Android to running completely new operating systems altogether (such as the popular CyanogenMod). Unlocking and rooting comes with certain extra security risks and most people steer clear because it's not particularly easy to do. In the case of the Pixel and the Pixel XL, it should only take a few minutes with the right tools. I am root Have a look at the "root only" apps on the Android apps section of the Google Play Store to see what's possible with rooting: you can tweak battery and CPU performance, perform full phone backups, better control the file system and more. Most users won't ever need or want to unlock or root their phones but it's something advanced users and developers always look for, and another reason for those particular groups of people to go all in with Google's new pair of devices. The phones officially go on sale on 20 October: you can pick up the Pixel from $649/£599/AU$1,079 and the Pixel XL from $769/£719/AU$1,269 direct from Google. Stay tuned for our full reviews of both.

Mobile 25 0 0 October 15, 2016 HTC Bolt Specs: HTC 10 Look-Alike The Company’s First To Get Android 7.0 Nougat And To Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jack? Venus Montalbo More details about the HTC Bolt specs are surfacing online. If the latest leaks and specs reports are to be trusted, this upcoming mid-range smartphone from the Taiwanese manufacturer will showcase more than one “first.” According to a report from Pocket-Lint, which cited an HTC ROM developer known as LlabTooFer, Bolt is going to be the first HTC-branded smartphone to run on Android 7.0 Nougat OS at launch. “You may think that the Google Pixel and Pixel XL actually claim that title since they’re probably being made by HTC too,” the post noted. “However there’s no actual HTC branding on those phones, so they don’t count. And, in fact, they go one better anyway, with Android 7.1.” HTC Bolt in silver. pic.twitter.com/vAFVInwnbc — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 21, 2016 The ROM developer also shared that HTC Bolt, with alleged codename Acadia, will have Android Nougat, Google’s newest mobile OS iteration, together with Sense 8 UI that is also found on HTC 10, the tech conglomerate’s 2016 flagship device. In addition to having the same skin, it seems like HTC 10 and HTC Bolt will also share similarities in terms of form and appearance. The Bolt renders that recently showed up online revealed the same metal body, Pocket Lint also shared. When it comes to Bolt’s specs, the leaks also indicated that it may get a rear-facing camera with dual LED flash as well as a front-mounted fingerprint sensor. As for other possible specs, a Venture Beat post from the prolific tech tipster Evan Blass noted that even though Bolt and HTC 10 seem to have the same look, the former will be a larger smartphone. Bolt will reportedly be equipped with a 5.5-inch display, while the flagship model’s display size is only 5.2 inches. Under the display, the leaked renders also showed that Bolt will get a fingerprint scanner located between the front-facing capacitive buttons. Moreover, the rumored smartphone is going to use a USB Type-C port. [Image by David Ramos/Getty Images] As for other purported details on the phone’s camera, Bolt is expected to feature an 18 MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture and 4K video capture support. The selfie shooter might get an 8 MP lens sensor. Moreover, when it comes to Bolt’s under the hood specs, the report revealed that it will be packed with 3 GB of RAM. It will also get a 64GB native storage with an option for expansion via a microSD. But on the top of all these purported specs and features is a remarkable change that HTC may apply to Bolt. Accordingly, the upcoming smartphone is going to be the tech company’s first mobile device to drop the 3.5mm headphone jack. This could be plausible especially now that the tech world is slowly seeing other giant players in the market like Apple removing this once fundamental feature in their latest flagship devices. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFyRks-Qw5Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Meanwhile, below is another interesting note pointed out by Evan Blass. “Interestingly, while Bolt does offer HTC’s BoomSound audio-enhancing tech, it’s only available when listening with headphones; the handset itself contains but a single, bottom-firing speaker.” The smartphone’s release date is still unknown but it is expected to have a global launch. It is reportedly hitting the shelves in the US and select countries in territories like Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Sprint will allegedly carry the device in the US. In fact, as reported in GSM Arena,HTC Bolt is supposedly set for release on Sprint by the end of this month. If this is true, then, this should mean that Bolt’s official introduction is already on the horizon. Are you looking forward to another mobile offering from HTC? The Inquisitr will continue to keep you in the loop for more release and specs updates about the HTC Bolt.

The company today introduced a new feature that will tag and help find “fact checking in large news stories.” Tagged articles will show up in the new story box on news.google.com, as well as in the Google News and Weather app for iOS and Android in the US and UK. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat There’s a two-pronged approach to detecting fact checking. First Google looks for actual markup in the site’s source code. Then Google looks for pages “that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks.” You can learn more about the process here. Though Google makes no mention of the ongoing US presidential election, I can’t help but feel this is a subtle nudge towards making voters are keeping track of who’s telling the truth and who’s not (need I even explain?). It’s meant to help clear up hoaxes too, but right now, politics are likely the focus. To be clear, the tags show up in small grey text above the article links – Google itself isn’t passing judgement, nor does it tell you the source article’s conclusion in search results. It’s merely a sign that says “hey, read me to find out the truth.” Still, it’s a nice way to make sure readers are at least forming opinions based on fact rather than fiction.

Thank you so much to everyone who has left comments, it’s the best bit of this blog by a country mile, and very much appreciated.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Oct 15, 2016 at 8:50AM Image source: Getty Images. Nearly 10% of all new light vehicles sold will have full self-driving capabilities by 2035, according to IHS Automotive. Automakers and technology companies are delivering incremental self-driving features right now that will eventually bring us full vehicle autonomy in the coming years.  This means there are lots of companies out there making some level of autonomous vehicle technology, and there's no sign of this trend slowing down. Just last month, the U.S. government released federal guidelines for driverless cars, which is estimated to be a $42 billion market by 2025. Needless to say, investors would be wise to jump on the companies that are shaping this industry now. To help you get started, here are three companies that are making huge strides in driverless car tech: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). The obvious choice Alphabet's Google has had clear ambitions in the driverless car space for quite a while, and the company is still one of the dominant leaders in creating autonomous car technology.  Google just crossed another milestone with its driverless car technology by racking up a total of 2 million miles of autonomous driving on roadways. The company took six years to reach 1 million miles, but added an additional 1 million miles just 16 months later, according to The Next Web. Google made another huge move in the space this year when it announced that it will work with Fiat Chrysler to build driverless car prototypes. The partnership will combine Google's technology with 100 vehicles (based on the Pacifica) made by Fiat specifically for Google. All of this marks the first time the tech giant is directly working with an automaker.  Google has a clear advantage in the driverless car space that investors shouldn't overlook, even if it's still a bit unclear how the company will make money from its autonomous car technology. It could license the tech to automakers or use its massive amount of data and services to somehow serve ads based on car data (that's just speculation at this point, though). What's clear is that Google is committed to driverless cars (it's already spent more than $60 million, at a $30 million per year run rate), and it's showing no signs of backing away. With millions of autonomous miles driven, a new partnership with Fiat, and plenty of R&D spending, investors shouldn't bet against Google's advantage in the space. The growing driverless car play NVIDIA is building up its own arsenal of automotive technologies and using its experience with graphics processing units (GPUs) to give it a leg up in the space.  NVIDIA's GPUs are already used by automakers to power infotainment systems for Honda, BMW, Tesla, and others, but now it's also using some of its processors to power complex artificial intelligence computers that give driverless cars situational awareness.  The company's Drive PX 2 supercomputer is an on-board AI computer that processes images in real time for self-driving cars and is already used by 80 automakers and Tier 1 automotive suppliers. NVIDIA expanded its reach in the space recently when it released its new Xavier system-on-a-chip (SoC) which is a faster, smarter processor for the Drive PX computer. Xavier uses less energy than before and can essentially do the same work as two former Drive PX processors.  NVIDIA only makes about 8% of its total revenue from its automotive business right now, but the segment is growing. The company improved sales in its automotive business by 68% in fiscal Q2 2017, year over year. If all of that weren't enough, the company is pioneering cloud-to-car technology with its DGX-1 supercomputer that could allow driverless cars to get the most relevant driving information updated from the cloud.  Tesla's tangible driverless tech The electric automaker isn't shy about its driverless car plans. CEO Elon Musk has said that Tesla's vehicles will be able to drive themselves across the country by 2018 (he's also admitted that might take a little longer than that), and the company -- of course -- already has its semi-autonomous feature, Autopilot, in its vehicles.  Tesla has been criticized lately for its Autopilot feature (which allows limited semi-autonomous driving on highways), with Consumer Reports saying that some features aren't yet ready for public beta. The criticism came after a Tesla owner was killed in a crash over the summer when Autopilot failed to recognize a truck turning in front of his vehicle. Tesla has defended Autopilot and recently updated the software to better use the on-board radar to view obstacles and traffic and to see two cars ahead of the vehicle. The update also improved auto-steering and added more safety warnings for drivers. Autopilot also requires drivers to remain alert, keep their hands on the wheel, and to take back control when necessary. Tesla's advantage in the space is that its system is far more advanced than others on the road, and it's readily available in the company's Model S and X vehicles. Even Tesla's upcoming $35,000 Model 3 will have Autopilot capabilities (though it'll add more to the cost). Other automakers may be busy creating their own semi-autonomous systems, but Tesla's version continues to be one of the most prolific.  This might take a while Investors shouldn't expect immediate gains from these companies simply on the basis of their driverless car technologies. Alphabet is a huge tech conglomerate, Tesla makes its money by selling cars, and NVIDIA's core business is selling GPUs for gaming. But these companies are making huge bets on self-driving technology now -- and investors looking to benefit later would be wise to act soon.

Mizuguchi, believes VR is exactly the kind of technology his game "Rez Infinite" has been waiting for. The original version of the game went on sale in 2001 for an earlier console called Sega Dreamcast.(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) In this Sept. 13, 2016 photo, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, founder and... From a technical standpoint, the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift are the two best virtual reality headsets on the market. But the Sony PlayStation VR, which went on sale last week, is a close third, which should be good enough to make it the most popular device among people who want to take an early dive into virtual reality. Make no mistake, that dive will cost plenty, and it’s an investment that only early technology enthusiasts will want to make. But after testing a PlayStation VR review unit here at The Chronicle, I believe it’s even more clear that virtual reality is the next new electronic medium. And if you already have a PlayStation 4 game console, Sony’s headset is easier to set up, and cheaper overall than the Vive or the Rift. Sony also makes a compelling case by releasing 30 games like “Batman: Arkham VR,” which is so realistic you believe you’ve become the Caped Crusader. And if you’re not into games, there’s “Allumette,” an engaging animated short story from San Francisco’s Penrose Studios that makes you feel as though you’re floating in the clouds. (Remember to have tissues ready.) I base my comparison on games and other content I’ve sampled on all three of these wired VR headsets over the past year. This month, for example, I tried an Oculus game called “The Unspoken,” which turns you into a wizard who can use his hands to create fireballs to fling. Photo: Liz Hafalia, The Chronicle The Playstation VR device attached to its charge and display station. The Playstation VR device attached to its charge and display station. I’ve also viewed content using the cheaper, entry-level Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard viewers, which rely on smartphones to display video, so the resolutions are not as crisp as the PlayStation VR. (Google’s DayDream View isn’t out until next month.) The PlayStation VR will help Sony seize the middle ground because it provides a far better experience than the smartphone viewers and is not as expensive to set up as the Vive or the Rift, which could require spending more to upgrade your PC. The base PlayStation VR costs $400, compared with the the $600 Rift and the $800 Vive. The big difference is that the PlayStation VR requires only a PlayStation 4 video game console instead of a powerful or upgraded PC. If you’re one of the 40 million people who already owns the console, all you have to do is plug in the headset’s included adapter. However, for the full experience, you also need a PlayStation Camera to help track your movements, and a pair of Move hand controllers, which in games like “Batman” give you virtual hands to pick up objects and throw bat-shaped boomerangs as if you were really in the game. Sony is offering an introductory bundle that includes those accessories with the headset for $500. You also have to clear enough space in your room to move around without bumping into furniture. Unlike the Vive, which lets you physically move about in a confined space, the PlayStation VR is mainly meant for users to sit down or stand up in one place. However, I was able to take a step or two around, and for experiences like “Allumette,” I could lean my head forward for a close-up look at the characters. We found setting up the PSVR, which Sony loaned to The Chronicle, takes two people, and so does this review. The Chronicle’s Christopher T. Fong helped me calibrate the headset to the camera so I didn’t have to stumble around with the headset over my eyes. He said he was also surprised by the number of cables required. “I can imaging tripping over cable tentacles around my entertainment center, which also has my X1, X360, PS3, PS4, Roku, sound bar system, vinyl record player and Bluetooth music receiver,” he said. “I’m having ‘Rock Band’ peripherals trauma all over again.” Also, if you’ve never tried VR before and receive the Sony gear as a gift, the whole experience could be confusing. You’ll have to practice putting the strap around your head and adjusting the goggles around your eyes. Make sure you keep the controllers within arms reach. Sony has come a long way since it released the headset as Project Morpheus more than two years ago. Fong was surprised at how comfortable the goggles now feel, even for someone wearing glasses. More by Benny Evangelista Virtual reality beckons holiday shoppers Oculus, Zuckerberg announce $250 million VR investment Warriors showcase VR with Andre Iguodala bobblehead “As an eyeglasses-only kind of person, I noticed the VR screens and text were slightly out of focus,” he said. “However, it wasn’t as noticeable once the games started. The blurred action movements and immersion of being in the game drew my attention away from being picky about a minor focusing problem.” In “Batman,” there is a point when you look in a mirror and see yourself wearing the bat suit. In “Eve: Valkyrie,” you’re sitting in the cockpit of a star fighter heading into a battle in space. For “DriverClub VR,” Fong said, “sitting in an F1 cockpit felt claustrophobic and tight. I was experiencing this virtual anxiety of making fast tight turns. I love that I used the side mirrors trying to spot where other cars were. The PSVR should add a wind machine peripheral.” We did notice the games and content took time to load. This is OK with a regular game because you can do something else, but in a headset, you spend an awful lot of time sitting in the dark waiting for something to happen. Perhaps game makers need to work on more engaging load screens.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     As the world watches Samsung deal with the fallout from what could be the worst smartphone launch in recent memory, there should be a smile on faces at Google headquarters. Samsung is a crucial Google partner for its Android mobile operating system. Indeed, Android and Samsung have become almost synonymous for many consumers these days -- something that Google may not particularly want for its open mobile operating system. So perhaps to shift that perception, Google is trying to stake its own claim to being the premier Android brand with its recent introduction of its Pixel and Pixel XL. Google is moving on the high-end smartphone world at a good time. Samsung, the world's top-selling smartphone maker, is dealing with a potentially brand-crushing crisis. First its new, top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 7 phones caught on fire; now the replacement ones are reportedly exploding, too. The Yonhap News Agency in South Korea reported eight cases of fires in replacement phones, five in the United States, one in South Korea and another in Taiwan. The fallout has been clear: Slightly more than a third of Samsung smartphone owners said they would not buy another phone from the company after the Galaxy Note 7 recall, according to a survey from brand consultant firm Branding Brand, which conducted the poll before the replacements started catching on fire. Meanwhile, Google's other rival in the mobile world -- Apple -- has been dogged by complaints that it is lagging in innovation. Many analysts who expressed that concern were not soothed by the latest iPhone, which took some small steps forward but also controversially ditched the headphone jack. Google went out of its way to mock the iPhone when it introduced the $769 Pixel, noting that its brand-new smartphone is cutting edge but retains its headphone jack. Google even bragged about its new shade of blue for its smartphone, which could be read as a parody of Apple's genuine excitement over its new shade of black. But Samsung's slide, and the damage from its horrendous Galaxy Note 7 launch is perhaps an even greater gift to Google. Many people have turned to Samsung phones as the anti-iPhone preference of choice. With customers admitting they're getting wary about other models of Samsung phones -- despite the fact that none have had problems anywhere near the scale as the Note 7 -- Google's Pixel fits neatly into whatever gap Samsung leaves behind. Compounding those woes even more is the Galaxy battery fires are happening right before the holidays when smartphone companies do their best business. "I think Samsung in their rush to get out the next product obviously didn't study it well enough and now they are suffering the consequences of that lack of care," said Jeff Kagan, an Atlanta-area telecommunications analyst, in an email. "This is devastating to Samsung and will continue to be devastating to Samsung." While Samsung initially reported that the vast majority of Note 7 customers who traded in their phones were choosing another Samsung phone, anecdotal reports online indicate that is no longer the case. In fact, AT&T and T-Mobile said they were going to stop exchanging the Note 7 phones even before Samsung confirmed that it was halting all production of the phone. Even Samsung said it can't fault them for that decision, in light of the scattered reports that the replacement phones are suffering from the same heat problems as the faulty phones they replaced. "We recognize that carrier partners have stopped sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note 7 in response to reports of heat damage issues, and we respect their decision," Samsung said in a statement. There's no guarantee Google will be able to swoop in and fill the gap completely. The Pixel phones are only available through Verizon, unless shoppers want to pay the full price for an unlocked version on Google's own store. Verizon is the nation's largest carrier, but the exclusive arrangement may limit sales. Still, even if Google's own phone doesn't manage to be the iPhone alternative of the holiday season, the company will still likely see other Android manufacturers get a boost through the end of the year. "While this is terrible news for Samsung, it may be great news for their competitors," Kagan said. "LG, Moto, Huawei and many other Android smartphones will quickly fill the gap left by this Samsung problem." --- The Washington Post's Fred Barbash, and Anna Fifield from Tokyo contributed to this report.

It's already hit a snag: Samsung's deal to acquire Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Mark Bergen Bloomberg     Google just debuted a digital assistant, which it hopes to place inside smartphones, watches, cars and every other imaginable internet-connected device. It's already hit a snag. The Alphabet Inc. division launched new smartphones last week with the artificially intelligent assistant deeply embedded. It also rolled out a speaker with the feature at its core and announced plans to let other companies tie their apps and services to the assistant. A day later, Samsung Electronics Co., one of the largest manufacturers of smartphones and other consumer devices, said it was acquiring Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant. At first, the deal looked like a counterpunch to Samsung rival Apple -- Viv is run by the creators of Apple's Siri assistant. But buying Viv may be more of a problem for Google, because Samsung is the biggest maker of phones running Google's Android mobile operating system. Google strategy is now centered on the assistant, rather than its search engine, because it's a more natural way for people to interact with smartphones and other connected devices. Getting all Android phone makers to put the Google assistant on their devices would get the technology into millions of hands quickly. But Samsung's Viv deal suggests assistants are too important for phone makers to let other companies supply this feature. Last week, Samsung executive Injong Rhee said the company plans to put Viv's technology in its smartphones next year and then embed it into other electronics and home appliances. A Samsung representative and a Google spokeswoman declined to comment. That's a necessity for Samsung, according to some analysts and industry insiders. "As AI is becoming more sophisticated and valuable to the consumer, there's no question it will be important for hardware companies," said Kirt McMaster, executive chairman of Cyanogen, a startup that makes Android software. McMaster, a frequent Google critic, said other Android handset makers will likely follow Samsung's move. "If you don't have an AI asset, you're not going to have a brain," he added. Google may already have known that some Android phone makers -- known as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs -- were reluctant to embrace its assistant. "Other OEMs may want to differentiate" Google's Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer told Bloomberg before it released its own smartphones. "They may want to do their own thing -- their own assistant, for example." Samsung and Google have sparred in the past over distribution. Google requires Android handset makers to pre-install 11 apps, yet Samsung often puts its own services on its phones. And the South Korean company has released devices that run on its own operating system, called Tizen, not Android. Viv was frequently on the short-list of startups that could help larger tech companies build assistant technology. Founded four-years ago by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham, the startup was working on voice technology to handle more complex queries than existing offerings. While it drummed up considerable attention and investment, Viv has not yet released its product to the public. And some analysts are skeptical of Samsung's ability to convert the technology into a credible service, given its mixed record with software applications. "It will be very hard to compete with Google's strength in data and their AI acquisitions," said Jitendra Waral, senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "Samsung would need to prove that its AI solutions are superior to that of Google's. They are handicapped in this race." Samsung is also focused on handling the fallout from its exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones, potentially taking management time away from its Viv integration. But it's a race Samsung has to join. In recent years, Samsung acquired mobile-payments and connected-device startups to keep up with Apple, Google and Amazon.com Inc. Digital voice-based assistants may be more important, if they become the main way people interact with devices. Silicon Valley titans are rushing into the space because of this potential. Amazon is trying to sign up developers for its Alexa voice technology. Apple has recently touted more Siri capabilities and opened the technology to other developers. And now Google, considered the leader in artificial intelligence, is making its own push. "I don't ever remember a time when every single major consumer tech company -- and even enterprise companies -- have been singularly focused on an identical strategy," said Tim Tuttle, chief executive officer of MindMeld Inc., a startup working on voice interaction software. "They're all following the exact same playbook." --- Jungah Lee contributed.

Live feed Show 10.20am EDT 10:20 So there you have it. Andy Murray is through to yet another final – that’s 10 and counting in 2016 – and will feel he has every chance of clinching his sixth title of the year against an opponent he has beaten in each of their previous two meetings. He wasn’t always at his best against Gilles Simon, but he got the job done at the key moments and rediscovered his service rhythm with a vengeance in the second set. The No1 ranking will have to wait until next year, given that he lags Djokovic by nearly 4,000 points. But the points differential in terms of the race to London – where Murray trails Djokovic by 9,285 points to the Serb’s 10,600 – is indicative of the strides he has made since the turn of the year.

Second set: Murray* 6-4, 6-3 Simon (*denotes server) It’s taken an hour and 43 minutes of sometimes patchy tennis, but Andy Murray has won in straight sets again. His 22 winners were largely cancelled out by an uncharacteristic 30 unforced errors, but he found an extra gear in the second set, not least on serve. He will now play his 10th final of what has been a remarkable year.

My money’s on the latter. A great game from the Frenchman, full of confidence and authority, belies his match-long struggle with ball in hand and gives Murray plenty to think about as he prepares to serve for the match for a second time. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.49am EDT 09:49 Second set: Murray* 6-4, 5-2 Simon (*denotes server) A loss of focus from Murray or a final gesture of defiance from Simon? However you read it, it’s a break of serve. Some gritty play from Simon carries him to 15-30 on the Murray serve, at which point Murray drives long for no apparent reason. He saves the first by clinching a gruelling, 23-stroke rally, but is unable to stave off the second. Great tenacity from Simon, but probably a case of delaying the inevitable. Probably.

It’s not that Simon has played badly here, it’s just that Murray has got progressively better as the match has worn on and the Frenchman has been unable to keep pace with him. Murray to serve for the match and deservedly so.

Christine Herbert will be pleased indeed. “Looking at the points difference between Murray and Djokovic at beginning of the season,” she writes, “I would never have thought Murray could have been this close by the end of it. Shame there’s not quite enough points on offer to make it this year – but all to play for next.” Indeed there is, Christine, especially with Djokovic looking so vulnerable just now.

Not that you’d know it. There’s no celebration from the Frenchman as Murray fails to make a forehand over the high part of the net, and that suggests he considers himself still very much in this match. He may be alone in that belief.

Nevertheless, although breathing heavily at times – and rolling his eyes in dismay when Simon carves out a break point at 30-40 – Murray finds a way. His serve has picked up markedly in this set – he’s missed just one first delivery so far – and he emphasises the improvement with a booming ace to hold. Break consolidated.

The difference now is that the exchanges are being punctuated by mistakes. Twice Simon makes lamentable errors to fall behind, flirting with a potentially fatal break of serve. But Murray, seemingly rattled by a poor call that required a successful challenge, struggles to summon his trademark consistency, handing Simon a lifeline. Deuce turns to advantage, advantage to deuce. More break points go begging. Neither man can land the decisive blow. Finally, though, Murray constructs a fifth break point, Simon failing to whisk a forehand pass off his shoelaces, and this time the Scot makes the most of it. Another brutal, probing rally concludes with a whirring forehand placement, and Simon has it all to do now. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.13am EDT 09:13 Second set: Murray* 6-4, 1-0 Simon (*denotes server) It’s a measure of Murray’s mettle that he took that opening set despite making 18 unforced errors and winning just 40% of the points played on his second serve. Not that he seems to be dwelling on it much, judging by the alacrity with he wraps up the opening service game of set two. The next game could be crucial for Simon.

First set: Murray 6-4 Simon* (*denotes server) Wonderful, wonderful tennis – and that’s just the opening point, which culminates with a lovely exchange of touch shots between the two men. Murray comes out on the wrong side of that one, watching helplessly as Simon caresses an angled winner across the face of the net, but hits back from 40-15 down with a combination of gritty defensive play and carefully judged aggression. It carries the world No2 to a set point that he converts in quite delightful fashion, responding to a lob volley from Simon (and when was the last time you saw one of those?) with an exquisite lobbed winner of his own. What a beautiful game tennis can be. Although don’t mention that to Simon, who looks decidedly rueful as he makes his way to the chair. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.00am EDT 09:00 First set: Murray* 5-4 Simon (*denotes server) What is it about this match? Murray has been serving brilliantly all week, but his first delivery seems to have deserted him today. After an error-strewn start to the game, the Scot rolls a topspin forehand into the net for 15-40 and, although he staves off the first break point with some good attacking play, he concedes the next with another unforced error. Dear me. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.56am EDT 08:56 First set: Murray 5-3 Simon*(*denotes server) As Simon moves 30-0 ahead courtesy of a netted backhand volley from the stretching Murray, Simon McMahon writes: “You’re right that us Simons are unassuming, but so is Andy to be fair. And he’s acquired a ruthlessness on court that both Gilles and I can only dream of. I’ll settle for unassuming, though. Which is why I’ll never be world No1.” Neither will Gilles at this rate, Simon. First he misses a forehand, then he double-faults. Sensing vulnerability at the other end of the court, Murray pounces, another foray into the net reaping dividends. Even so, he’s not having the best of days in the forecourt, Murray, and a volleying error sees the break point go begging. No matter. More aggressive play brings up a second chance, and this time the Scot nails it with a superb return. You could stick Marmite on that second serve from Simon and call it toast. Assuming you can find any Marmite, obviously. Ruthless did you say, Simon? You’re not wrong.

The point is underlined at 0-30 when the Scot produces a wretched double-fault that leaves him gesturing in frustration. If he was upset about that, he’ll be a good deal unhappier about the inelegant forehand volley that he then puts wide to concede the game.

A double-fault at deuce lands him in the soup again, and Murray then conjures a penetrating return to get Simon on the run. A deep approach seals the deal and that’s four games in a row for Murray.

Should he hit to Murray’s forehand, which has been as solid as the proverbial rock this week? Or should he steer the ball to the Murray backhand, which the world No2 is loading with slice, giving his opponent low, skidding balls on which he can get scant purchase? The Frenchman is confounded further when Murray unexpectedly leans a little harder on a two-hander, rushing the scrambling Simon into a backhand error, before finding some extra heat on a second serve to bring up 40-15. Murray seals the game with an imperious backhand winner that his opponent can only stand and admire. Lovely play from the second seed.

As he tries to make inroads on Novak Djokovic’s points advantage at the top of the world rankings, Andy Murray could have been forgiven for having half an eye on a potential final with the Serb. But the world No1 has crashed out in the semis, losing to Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets. That ought to put a spring in Murray’s step as he prepares to face Gilles Simon, the wily Frenchman over whom he holds a 14-2 head-to-head advantage. Not that Murray needs much by way of encouragement just now. Maintaining the momentum of last week’s China Open victory, Murray has been in dominant form in Shanghai, accounting for Steve Johnson, Lucas Pouille and David Goffin without the loss of a set. If Simon is to notch up his first win over Murray since besting him on an indoor hard court in Rotterdam in February 2015, he’ll need to find something special.

It's hard to know what's true and what's false, and always has been. Hoaxes, rumors, urban legends, conspiracy theories, political spin and propaganda have been with us for millennia. The internet has made this problem both better and worse. It's better because we can look things up and research what's true. For example, Googling "lemming suicide" returns stories on the fabrication of the myth. But it's also worse, because falsehoods are easier to spread on social media and elsewhere. In recent months, fact-checking (which in the past only professional journalists fretted over) has become central to political discourse. "Fact-checking" has come up in discussions about the role of moderators in presidential political debates and has been repeatedly mentioned during the debates themselves. Before the internet, most fact-checking happened before publication. Anyone who cared about facts subscribed to trusted newspapers and magazines. Editors on staff, and sometimes dedicated, full-time fact-checkers, identified and researched every factual assertion. That's all you had to do: Pick reputable sources of news (like the publication you're reading now). Trouble is, social media causes us to lose control over the sources of information we're exposed to. We see whatever is shared by the people we follow. And they share stories from their followers. And so on. Technology created this problem. Can technology solve it? Algorithms giveth, and algorithms taketh away Google this week added a "Fact Check" item to search results. This links to an article that's designed to offer explicit fact-checking related to the search query, and it appears in the expanded story box on Google News for users in the U.S. and U.K., as well as the Google News & Weather apps on both iOS and Android. The "Fact Check" result joins other categorical highlights, including "In-Depth," "Wikipedia," "Local Source" and, my favorite, "Opinion." And speaking of opinion, how does Google choose which fact-check article to highlight? The company starts by looking for schema.org ClaimReview markup, which provides specifics in a web page's code on what exactly is being fact-checked in an article. It then uses a wide range of other signals to surface what Google algorithms conclude is the most reliable and authoritative fact-checking article related to the search query. Nice! Meanwhile, the opposite is happening at Facebook. After Facebook's human editorial team was criticized by a political activist for bias in how they chose stories for Facebook's Trending feature, Facebook laid off the editorial staffers in late August and replaced them with algorithms. Unfortunately, these algorithms are having a hard time telling fake stories from real ones. "The Intersect" reportedly ran a series of experiments and found out that Facebook has published several hoax or fake stories in its Trending section. Facebook algorithms are actually choosing hoaxes and deliberately spreading them to millions of users. Sadly, we humans don't need help from algorithms. We can spread misinformation just fine without them. Anything for traffic Did you hear about Rachel Brewson? She became the subject of a series of articles on the women's site xoJane. She's a Hillary Clinton supporter who fell in love with a Donald Trump supporter named Todd. At first, their political disagreements added passion to their relationship, and they got married. But then things soured, they split up and Rachel penned a post on xoJane headlined, "Trump is Tearing My Marriage Apart." Great story, right? The online news site "Fusion" thought so, and interviewed the couple on camera. So did ABC's Nightline. Unfortunately, it never happened, and Rachel Brewson doesn't exist. The whole thing was a publicity stunt to drive traffic to a now-defunct site called "Review Weekly." They even hired actors to play Rachel and Todd on camera. This is a fraudulent business model. It's fiction presented as nonfiction, based on the idea that a prurient, gossip-centric, reality-TV-obsessed public needs to believe a drama is true in order to stay engaged. Before Jezebel's investigative journalism exposed the fraud, there was no way to "fact-check" the story, no way to know for sure whether the story was true, partly true or a total lie. And speaking of lies... Let's talk politics Political organizations have always spread disinformation that helps their candidates. But in recent years, they've been spreading disinformation about fact-checking itself! I learned this the hard way. Watching the political arguments over the upcoming U.S. presidential election take over my Twitter stream, it became clear that each side was arguing from its own set of facts. And this frustrated me, because facts are facts -- or they're supposed to be. So I experimented by responding to heated political arguments with links to fact-checking sites. To quote a common clickbait catchphrase, you won't believe what happened next! My tweets were pounced upon by hoards of people convinced that fact-checking sites are biased, corrupt and untrustworthy. Every specific site I linked to was discredited as owned or controlled by a politician or their supporters, or it was a "joke," not to be taken seriously. Political propaganda has successfully inoculated a minority of the voting public against the scourge of fact-checking. They've been told that the news media are corrupt and fact-checking sites mere smokescreens. The professional political operatives that advise candidates also anticipate fact-checking and have learned to make their comments fact-check-proof. They do this by being slippery, vague and categorical, instead of specific. An entire political style of speaking has emerged, designed to be fact-check-proof. For example, saying that a candidate voted in Congress against a specific bill designed to thwart ISIS is fact-checkable. Saying that a candidate "did nothing to stop ISIS" is not fact-checkable. Saying that a candidate's specific policy prescriptions have been denounced by a specific expert is fact-checkable. Saying that a candidate "has no clue about what to do [about education and innovation]" is not fact-checkable. Still, the fact-checking sites try to fact-check such statements and wind up posting long-winded explanations and somewhat subjective conclusions, all of which provide more fodder for argument, disagreement and partisanship, rather than clarity over the facts. So is that it? Are we really living in a post-fact world? How to be an informed citizen Thanks to the social web and the way it exposes us all to unreliable content, we're mostly on our own when it comes to figuring out what's true and what's false. In my opinion, each of the major fact-checking sites is pretty solid. And when several sites agree -- when there's a consensus among the fact-checking sites about a specific point -- that consensus can be taken as a fact you can rely on. My favorite fact-checking sites include Emergent, On The Issues, Factcheck.org, Snopes, Politifact, About.com, Truth Or Fiction and Hoax Slayer. My best advice is to promote these sites from passive reference sites to active sources of content. Spend quality time proactively browsing your favorite fact-checking sites, as if they were blogs or news sites. They're great sources of information because they tend to be clear and present controversial information in a systematic way that helps understanding. Also: Add the Twitter accounts of several fact-checking sites to your feed or add the RSS to your reader. Get the facts even before you get the lies. Don't be like the fake Disney lemmings and follow the internet masses over the cliff of confusion. We are not living in a post-fact world. Facts really do exist. And that's a fact.

Time and again they failed to complete their sets, and often they handed the ball over the Australia on the last after running a play that no-one seemed to know a thing about, much less the person with the ball. Their kicking was awful. Outside of a 20m period into halftime —a period that followed their only try to Proctor— NZ were clearly second best. But they’ve had a fair layoff since the end of the NRL season and I wouldn’t be writing off their Four Nations chances just yet. Australia weren’t exactly polished but they showed far greater composure and their left side attack looked particularly potent. All three debutants (Boyd, Holmes and Frizell) did well but it was old-hand Inglis who caused the most trouble, and he ended up as man of the match. As usual captain Smith and half Cronk kept the side well-oiled. And that’s that. Thanks for coming. See you next time.

A 25 per cent drop in the company’s market value this year has ratcheted up pressure for a sale. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, has little choice but to rally his troops in hopes of hastening improvements that would broaden the microblogging and video platform’s appeal — and keep predatory buyers at bay.  (BRYAN THOMAS / NYT FILE PHOTO)   By Michael LewisBusiness Reporter Sat., Oct. 15, 2016 Left at the altar after seeking buyout offers from potential suitors including Google and Salesforce.com, Twitter Inc. remains an independent company by default. As such, CEO Jack Dorsey has little choice but to rally his troops in hopes of hastening improvements that would broaden the microblogging and video platform’s appeal — and keep predatory buyers at bay. “The people who use Twitter every day deserve our best,” Dorsey said in a memo to staff obtained by Bloomberg on Monday. He cited Twitter’s live video strategy, calling the company the “people’s news network. The fastest place to get information — now it needs to be the first place people check to see what’s happening.” The 410-word memo did not mention the possibility of a sale, Twitter’s stagnating user growth, tumbling share price, or the fact that much larger rival Facebook is social media’s de facto first choice for news and information. Article Continued Below Along with growth worries and Twitter’s struggle to wring profits from its 313 million active monthly users, a 25 per cent drop in the company’s market value this year has ratcheted up pressure for a sale. Some have even called for an activist investor like Carl Icahn to take control of Twitter to pare costs, retool strategy and replace senior management. The loss of advertisers to Google and Facebook, along with disappointing engagement in the U.S., reportedly led Twitter to seek expressions of interest from potential acquirers with the process to be concluded by Oct. 27 when Twitter is slated to report third quarter earnings. But website Recode last week said rumoured buyers Disney, Google and Apple were all unlikely to enter the race to acquire money-losing Twitter, while cloud computing company Salesforce has taken itself out of the bidding, although it along with Google are still seen as among the most likely buyers. The indications of cold-footed suitors pushed shares down 10 per cent this week, helping to reduce Twitter’s market cap from more than $17 billion (U.S.) to $12.64 billion. That makes Twitter more affordable, but its market valuation remains high and future profitability is very much in doubt, according to Hedge fund manager John Hempton, who in a blog post, said the answer is big cuts in spending and staff to make the company more palatable to strategic buyers. Some analysts, however, believe the stock has farther to fall before any offer emerges from a strategic buyer or a private equity player who could shake out costs and replace Dorsey as CEO. A possibility is that Twitter will remain independent at least in the near term, allowing Dorsey more time to hone a strategy that relies on live streaming of sports, embraces longer tweets and encourages image and video sharing interactivity. Observers said premium subscription pricing could be applied to specialized content as a way to monetize segments of its users on an Internet network where too few brands have been willing to commit. “It a wonderful platform . . . that would be a tasty bit for Google to snap up,” said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management in Toronto. But he said investors are clearly disappointed with the progress Twitter has made under co-founder Dorsey on the road to monetization and profitability. Dorsey replaced Dick Costolo as CEO in the summer of 2015, although Dorsey has held onto his other job as chief executive of e-commerce company Square. Dorsey introduced several changes in an attempt to spur user growth and engage advertisers on Twitter, including a feature that highlights the best of the San Francisco-based company’s platform at any given moment. The company has also entered into a series of new sports-streaming deals and on Thursday announced that its live-video service Periscope will now let media companies and other users channel live video feeds directly, without the need for a smartphone to record the images. But industry data suggest the changes have so far failed to increase daily time spent on the platform and Twitter in its most recent earnings report showed just 1 per cent sequential user growth. It posted revenue below analysts’ estimates, with sales expanding year over year at the slowest pace since its IPO. Twitter also reported a smaller $86.4 million loss and positive free cash flow. And despite intense volatility around Twitter shares amid buyout speculation, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler in a report said market checks point to a third quarter revenue in the high end of forecasts, along with a slight improvement in monthly active users. “We think 4Q guidance could meet/exceed consensus.” David Trainer of research firm New Constructs, meanwhile, argues that Twitter’s live video streaming strategy holds promise, saying companies including Time Warner and Ford have signed deals with Twitter that guarantee ads on selected videos in Twitter accounts. “Despite its growth problems, Twitter is a unique platform, not only for live videos, but also for getting fast news from a wide variety of sources,” he said. “If the company can make it more convenient for people to use the service, and it keeps on working to improve user engagement, Twitter has a lot of room to grow.” Read more about: Twitter, Google The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

That seemed entirely in her grasp, but she struggled to pull away and was caught cold by Dideriksen’s blistering finish. Lotta Lepisto came third, with Lizzie Deignan sprinting to a creditable fourth placed finish. “I dreamed of a top ten... my team-mates were amazing today, I had a small crash and they brought me back,” says Dideriksen after the race, who admits her win “is a surprise for everybody”. Worth pointing out that she only had two team-mates – Julie Leth and Cecile Uttrup Ludwig – in the small Danish team.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.02am EDT 09:02 King is followed by Dutch and Australian riders, who are digging into their reserves of energy to keep pace with her. She hasn’t got away, but has certainly made this final lap interesting. It’s another British rider who counters, with Hannah Barnes making the running.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.59am EDT 08:59 One lap to go! The bell rings and Neben crosses the line out in front – but with the peloton bearing down on her. We appear to be 15km from an all-out bunch sprint for the title, but there will surely be solo breakaways to contend with before then. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.54am EDT 08:54 The Dutch team has so much pedigree – perhaps the best women’s team ever assembled – and Roxane Knetemann is the latest rider in orange to take up the reins, with the peloton moving at 41km/h, and still 20 seconds behind Neben. Britain still have numbers at the front, perhaps waiting for instructions for defending champion Lizzie Deignan. Elsewhere, Ting Ying Huang, a capable sprinter from Chinese Taipei, has crashed and is looking worse for wear as she tries to rejoin the race. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.51am EDT 08:51 Neben’s bid for glory looks set to fall short, with the gap just 20 seconds with 20km to go. Germany and Poland are making rare appearances at the front of the pack. It’s worth mentioning, given that this is a world championship event, that away from the finish line, absolutely no-one is watching from the side of the road. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.46am EDT 08:46 The peloton has shed a fair few riders in the attritional heat, but the big players are present, and have cut the gap on Neben to 25 seconds. The American looking slightly less carefree at the front, with 22km to go, and events back in the pack aren’t going the USA’s way either – Carmen Small needs a tyre change, and is left waiting at the side of the road. Ella (@ellacyclingtips) The last time a rider was both the world TT and RR champion was in 1995 when Jeannie Longo dominated. Can @amberneben repeat? #UCIDoha2016 October 15, 2016 Updated at 8.49am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.44am EDT 08:44 Two women that have driven the pace at different times today – Netherlands’ Ellen van Dijk and Australia’s Loren Rowney – lost touch with the main group at the start of this penultimate lap. Van Dijk has fought back, but Rowney’s race looks to be over. The same goes for Zabelinskaya, who has been disqualified and is waved off the course before she can begin another lap. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.39am EDT 08:39 There’s still a lack of organisation at the front of the pack, which allows Neben, a time trial master, to maintain her lead around the western edge of the Pearl. Britain have eight riders, and haven’t put the work in that the Dutch have – what can Deignan, Barnes, King et al pull out of the bag in the latter stages? It’s all very tactical with just over 25km to go. Sarah Connolly (@_pigeons_) One reason a lot of teams aren't chasing Neben yet is that if she's caught too soon, opens up chances for more Dutch attacks #UCIDoha2016 October 15, 2016 Updated at 8.41am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.37am EDT 08:37 Two laps to go, and Neben crosses in a time of 2:27:53 – and a gap of 36 seconds, as the peloton begin to regain their momentum. It took me longer than two-and-a-half hours to go 120km yesterday, and I was a) not travelling in desert heat, and b) in a car. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.34am EDT 08:34 Teams with pure sprinters in their midst – Wild’s Dutch team and Chloe Hosking’s Australia – are setting the pace at the top of the peloton, with Neben threatening to stretch her lead to a full minute. The shadows are lengthening in Doha, the temperature dropping a couple of degrees, but still unbelievably hot, of course. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.29am EDT 08:29 Much like in the Rio road race, Deignan is keeping a low profile, occasionally visible near the front as other riders burn themselves out trying to haul Neben in. 35km to go, and the gap is 45 seconds. It’s still a big ask, but she looks remarkably comfortable. Updated at 8.31am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.25am EDT 08:25 Those capable of taking this race in a breakaway move are agitating at the front of the pack – including Vos and Deignan. They may need to form a separate group to reel Neben in, who is still 40 seconds clear. Further down the field, Zabelinskaya appears to have been disqualified, for getting a tow from her team to get back into the pack. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.23am EDT 08:23 The Dutch team in an awkward spot now, lacking the legs to reel Neben in, and lacking support from the peloton after their aggressive tactics in the opening laps of this final circuit. Neben has stretched her lead to 40 seconds after that expertly timed breakaway. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.21am EDT 08:21 After a nervous ride through the free zone which saw a couple of riders, including Russia’s Olga Zabelinskaya, forced off their bikes, we have a solo breakaway, with American Amber Neben taking advantage of a tired peloton to carve out a 20-second lead. The 41-year-old will be feeling confident; she won the time trial here four days ago. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.15am EDT 08:15 Now it’s the turn of Anna van der Breggen, the Olympic champion, to crank up the pace, hands across the front of her handlebars, making it all look much easier than it actually is. Team-mate van Vleuten picks up the baton, and ends the fourth lap of the Pearl in the lead, followed by Sweden’s Sara Mustonen and Britain’s Hannah Barnes. Updated at 8.35am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.10am EDT 08:10 Dani King does make a move to keep pace with Vos, and a gap opens briefly before the peloton, led by Australia, reel them back in. Vos stays at the front as they take a tricky right-hand hairpin, before the Australian charge is weakened as Tiffany Cromwell suffers a mechanical problem, and falls a long way off the pace. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.09am EDT 08:09 They’re moving through the gears along a shady section of road, with Annemiek van Vleuten setting the pace. After her horrific crash in Rio, it’s remarkable that she’s racing here at all. She makes way for Amy Pieters, and then Vos, as the Netherlands are forced to counter-attack themselves. None of the other nations stocked with riders are willing to get involved. 50km to go... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.04am EDT 08:04 Hanselmann, previously part of a breakaway with Yonamine, is now rolling along at the back of the bunch, as shown by her on-board camera.

Updated at 8.18am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.59am EDT 07:59 Thanks Les. We’ve got 57km of racing to go, and another Dutch drive, led by the legendary Marianne Vos, has hauled in the breakaway. Every Dutch rider apart from sprinter Kirsten Wild has pulled away off the front, and it’s starting to wear the peloton out in 37-degree heat. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.53am EDT 07:53 With 65km left, the Dutch push hard again at the front through Vos. Deignan is quick to respond. As the pace quickens, the head of the peloton is starting to thin visibly. And as the tension ratchets up, I’m going to hand over to my colleague Niall McVeigh, who will guide you through the remainder of the race. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.46am EDT 07:46 Attack and retreat remains the order of the day as the big guns look to thin the field. Van der Breggen leads the latest charge by the Dutch, and it certainly has the desired effect, stretching the front of the peloton. Vos is up there too, with Deignan and King likewise firmly in the frame. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.41am EDT 07:41 Spare a thought for Giorgia Bronzini, who was unable to contest the race after falling sick. The Italian would have been a real contender here. Elena Cecchini is going well in her team-mate’s absence; she’s currently about seven places back in the peloton.

It doesn’t last long, but it could be part of a wider attempt to break up the Australian contingent. We’ll see. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.29am EDT 07:29 Aussie, Aussie, Aussie! Which is to say, the Australians are coming. Or they may be, at least. Chloe Hosking is among a group of three or four jostling for position at the head of the peloton, and that’s one to keep an eye on. If any country can live with the Dutch contingent in a bunch sprint, it’ll be them. They’re joined by a glut of German riders. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.25am EDT 07:25 Back at the front, where Yonamine has been joined by Nicole Hanselmann of Switzerland, there’s a 47-second gap to the field with 82km left. Surely the British will need to start thinking about splitting up the peloton soon? They can ill afford to sprint it out with the Dutch come the business end of proceedings. Speaking of the Netherlands, Vos is now close to the front of the peloton. She’s not been too prominent so far, but it’s unlikely things will stay that way. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.20am EDT 07:20 And as I write that, race favourite Kirsten Wild is unseated following a slow-motion collision with Poland’s Alicja Ratajczak. She’s quickly up, is the Dutchwoman, and doesn’t look unduly perturbed, but her bike may have sustained some damage. She’s just had to stop again for a technical adjustment and it’ll be interesting to see how the Dutch team respond. Will they help her back into contention, or will they simply seek to capitalise on their compatriot’s misfortune? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.16am EDT 07:16 With the race yet to start in earnest, the sprint specialists would doubtless be licking their lips if they weren’t so parched. Anna van der Breggen is at the head of the peloton, and you have to wonder whether the Dutch are trying to control the pace before battling it out late on. The big question being, as ever with Dutch teams, will they work for the collective good or break ranks in pursuit of solo glory? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.00am EDT 07:00 Meanwhile, further up the field, there’s a 21-second gap between Yonamine and the chasing pack with 97km to go. Updated at 7.10am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.58am EDT 06:58 It’s not been a good race for Kuwait so far. Noura Alameeri suffered an early crash, and she’s now been joined on the sidelines by Nada Aljeraiwi, if I’m not mistaken. That leaves Naija Aljeraiwi as the sole Kuwaiti representative. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.53am EDT 06:53 With 105km to go and the gap to Yonamine at 25 seconds, Russia hit the front of the peloton. There’s a grim determination etched on the collective countenance, with the riders desperately swilling water and dousing themselves with the dregs. Amber Neben, who is still bringing up the rear, is taking on ice. Looks like she’s collecting as much water as she can for her team-mates. No doubt they’ll be grateful. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.47am EDT 06:47 Plenty of action at the first feed zone, with all the riders scrambling to get fluids on board. Who can blame them in these conditions? Meanwhile, Yonamine continues to set the pace. She’s half a minute ahead of the rest. Interestingly, the 25-year-old is a former tennis player who only switched to cycling while at university. Judging by her performance here, she must have been an attack-minded sort on the tennis court; clearly she enjoys carrying the fight to the opposition. The riders head towards the gateway of the Pearl. Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images Updated at 7.01am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.40am EDT 06:40 Team tactics are likely to have a big bearing on the race and, with that in mind, it’s interesting that Roxane Kneteman has moved to the front of the peloton. The Dutch are the only team other than Great Britain with a full complement of eight riders and, with sprinters of the quality of Wild and Vos in their ranks, they’ll be eager to ensure a fast finish. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.33am EDT 06:33 Britain’s Hannah Barnes leads the peloton, which still lags Yonamine by about 20 seconds. It’s exhausting just watching, and we’re still on lap one of seven of this sweltering circuit. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.29am EDT 06:29 With the Pearl looming, a bunch of British riders have made their way to the front of the peloton. Dani King, who missed out on Rio in such heartbreaking fashion, is up there. So too is Lizzie Deignan. The gap to Yonamine is down to 15 seconds, although not for Amber Neben. A problem with her chain stopped the American in her tracks a couple of minutes ago, although she’s making up ground fast at the back of the field. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.23am EDT 06:23 Yonamine ploughs on into a light headwind of about five or six miles per hour. She’s about 38 seconds ahead of the main field at this stage. With the race expected to culminate in a bunch sprint, it’s interesting that she’s decided to seize the initiative so early. Fracturing the peloton is probably the best way to avoid a bunch finish, but it’ll take serious stamina to make the running and then break away from a smaller group in the closing stages. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.13am EDT 06:13 Yonamine continues to set the pace, with the gap to the peloton about 20 seconds. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.11am EDT 06:11 The distinctive Qatari landscape, full of cranes and construction sites, flashes past as the riders make their way towards the Pearl, an artificial island off the West Bay. Japan’s Eri Yonamine has made an early break from the peloton, but there’s no immediate reaction from the chasing pack. Little wonder, with 133 kms remaining. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.03am EDT 06:03 They’re off! It looks swelteringly hot and, as the riders make their way around the wide, open roads of Qatar’s Education City, the peloton looks loose and relaxed. No surprise there. These are not the conditions in which to make a flying start. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.47am EDT 05:47 Preamble Good morning and welcome. If you like your sport laced with dramatic subplots, you’ve come to the right place. While the competitors in this year’s women’s road race world championships will have their eyes firmly on the prize, the contest promises a host of potentially spellbinding sideshows and minor-key dramas. British interest will focus on Lizzie Deignan, the reigning champion, who is approaching the 134.5km course around Doha as “the last weekend of a tough year” defined by her successful appeal against a doping ban in the prelude to the Olympics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the controversy in which she became embroiled after missing three tests under the whereabouts rule has taken a mental toll on Deignan, and the noises emanating from her camp – not to mention the rider herself – suggest the combined effects of fatigue and an unfavourable course may be too much to handle. But it’s not all about Deignan. A flat course with no climbs will inevitably favour the sprinters, which makes Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands the woman to beat. Australia’s Chloe Hosking, who in July sped to a brilliant La Course victory on the Champs Élysées, has been preparing for the sweltering conditions in the Qatar capital by transforming her bathroom into a temporary sauna; she’s no slouch either. Ditto Marianne Vos, another former La Course winner, who has no fewer than seven sprint victories to her name this year. And let’s not forget her Dutch compatriot, Annemiek van Vleuten, who crashed out of the Olympic road race in such horrific fashion but – having recovered from a cracked spine – is fit and raring to go again. What a story it would be if she could win today. All that, and we haven’t even mentioned Olympic champion Anna van der Breggen, or the Belgian speedster Jolien D’Hoore. It should be quite a race.

We weren’t sure when they would land but that may have been cleared up to a degree today thanks to a new leak. There isn’t a lot of time left in 2016 for new smartphones and mobile gadgets to be announced. While there are always a few surprises out of left field, things are definitely winding down for the most part. There has been a lot of discussion on the Android Wear platform lately as well, including the fact manufacturers are opting to try different OS’s like Tizen. Well, it appears we won’t see the two new Google Smartwatches debut this year according to a tweet from @Evleaks. Google’s two smartwatches will be released with Android Wear 2.0 in Q1 2017 [image courtesy of: https://t.co/so8uJyEZCy] pic.twitter.com/ruejqXSNSy — Evan Blass (@evleaks) October 13, 2016 Evan Blass took to Twitter with news on the new Google Smartwatches. As you can see from the Tweet, there’s not much to say aside from the fact it will be disappointing to not have one under the tree this year. Nothing new was added in regards to the specs, but we know it will roll out with Android Wear 2.0 whenever it lands next year. While a solid release date would have been nice, they are likely to change and Q1 of 2017 narrows things down quite a bit. If true, the Google Smartwatches will debut between January 1st and March 31st which will be here quicker than you think. That said, it will be interesting to see what other wearables show up considering Huawei and others held off on new wearables this year. Are you excited for a true Google smartwatch?

Are you starting to get the picture? Google is by far the biggest search engine in the world, being used by billions of people on an every day basis. Actually, the expression “Google it” entered the folklore, just like “Xerox it” was back in the day with regard to photo copiers. If you are wondering what’s the problem with fact-check labels, well, just consider a few basic facts: Google’s search algorithms were proved to be “biased” in the past, times and times again. There were numerous articles written about how Google and Facebook are censoring news stories, favoring “selected” (left wing) candidates, imposing news-trends and things of that nature. Basically, both Google and Facebook can be described as digital ghettos in which information is “spoon-fed” or disseminated to the users, as opposed to a free-flow of information, as in a free market of ideas. Thing is, you don’t have any control over Google’s algos, and they’re a quasi-monopoly, having a global 73% market share, meaning that 3 in 4 people are using Google when searching the Interwebz. With great power comes great responsibility, of which Google has none. Let me elaborate on today’s news: Google will use an algorithm for determining if a news story featured in Google News requires a fact check label. That’s because Google wants us to be happy and well informed, by helping us, chickens, to find fact checking when it comes to large/sensitive news stories. There are over 100 fact checking websites currently, but it was proven times and times again that they can’t be trusted 100%, as they can (and will be) used for spinning public opinion, trends, influence elections, as in big tech companies colluding with Big Brother, times and times again. Who will fact check the fact checkers? I strongly recommend you to stop using Google search and to get out of the digital ghettos ASAP.

Home National Security Politics Issues Culture Columns Washington Free Beacon National Security Politics Issues Culture Columns Store Trump Picks Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff Painting the American Identity Managing an Ancient Empire Podesta Linked Up Google’s Executive Chairman and Cheryl Mills, Robby Mook Google was accused of manipulating search results for Hillary Share Tweet Email Eric Schmidt / AP BY: Joe Schoffstall Follow @JoeSchoffstall October 14, 2016 1:50 pm Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta facilitated meetings between Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and key Clinton players Robby Mook and Cheryl Mills in 2014, according to hacked emails released by WikiLeaks. Schmidt also quietly funds a data company that provides services to the Clinton campaign. Podesta wrote to Schmidt on April 3, 2014, saying he would like him to speak with Robby Mook, now Clinton’s campaign manager, and Cheryl Mills, a longtime Clinton aide. “Robby is in Australia. Back the 23rd. We could arrange a call before or wait and do a meeting shortly after return,” Podesta said. “Cheryl Mills is in town and I think it would be good for you two to talk. Her office is in Bethesda but probably could come down this afternoon. Up for that?” “thank you !!! i’ll plan to see robby when he is back in dc,” Schmidt responded (sic throughout). “Cheryl would be great to see; I have a meeting with President from 11 to 1145 and free after that all afternoon any time in the afternoon that is convenient for her is good for me.” Schmidt then provided Podesta with his phone number. Earlier this year, Schmidt found himself under fire after Google’s search engine was accused of manipulating searches in favor Hillary Clinton and against Donald Trump. The allegations stemmed from a video released in June by SourceFed, a news website and YouTube channel. The group showcased how Google’s autocomplete features differed from other major search engines and was altering searches to paint Clinton in a more favorable light. SourceFed discovered that when the phrase “Hillary Clinton Cri” was typed into Google’s search engine, it would autocomplete to “Hillary Clinton Crime Reform,” “Hillary Clinton Crisis,” and “Hillary Clinton Crime Bill 1994.” When the same phrase was typed into Bing and Yahoo, Google’s competitors, the autocomplete showed “Hillary Clinton criminal charges,” “Hillary Clinton crimes,” Hillary Clinton criminal.” SourceFed also found that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders did not receive the same treatment. When the group typed the same phrases into all of the search engines for Sanders and Trump, all three yielded identical results. A search for “Donald Trump rac,” for example, suggested “Donald Trump racist” on Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Schmidt responded to the allegations by claiming he does not support any candidate for president. “We have not taken a position on the American election and nor do I expect us to,” Schmidt said. Despite Schmidt’s publicly neutral stance on the election, he has provided funding to The Groundwork, a data startup that provides services to Clinton’s campaign. Michael Slaby, the former chief integration and innovation officer for Obama’s campaign, is the cofounder of Timshel, the company that developed The Groundwork. The Groundwork’s website does not provide any information on its data services and only displays a logo. Hillary Clinton’s campaign has paid The Groundwork almost $600,000 for “technology services” since the campaign’s inception, filings show. Hillary for America appears to be the only committee that pays The Groundwork this election cycle. Slaby did not respond to a request for comment sent to his company. Schmidt did not respond to inquiries sent to his email address dealing with the leaked Podesta emails and his funding of The Groundwork. Becca Rutkoff, a member of Google’s global communications and public affairs team, sent the Washington Free Beacon a statement the company released in June on the accusations it was manipulating its search results. “The autocomplete algorithm is designed to avoid completing a search for a person’s name with terms that are offensive or disparaging,” the statement reads. “We made this change a while ago following feedback that Autocomplete too often predicted offensive, hurtful or inappropriate queries about people. This filter operates according to the same rules no matter who the person is, as you can see in some examples here.” “Autocomplete isn’t an exact science, and the output of the prediction algorithms changes frequently,” it continues. “Predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity and freshness of search terms. Given that search activity varies, the terms that appears in Autocomplete for you may change over time.” Clinton’s campaign did not respond to inquiries.

Big Blue boffin Jennifer Chu holds a Power CPU die (Source: IBM) 15 Oct 2016 at 07:42, Chris Williams Chris Williams Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Windows 10, Arm, Apple, Intel, Microsoft Recent Articles Today the web was broken by countless hacked devices – your 60-second summary AMD is a rounding error on Intel's spreadsheet and that sucks for us all Intel stock falls on glum Q4 Google has gently increased pressure on Intel – its main source for data-center processors – by saying it is "looking forward" to using chips from IBM and other semiconductor rivals. The web advertising giant said it hopes to use a mix of "architectures within our cloud" in the future. Back in April, Google revealed it had ported its online services to Big Blue's Power processors, and that its toolchain could output code for Intel x86, IBM Power and 64-bit ARM cores at the flip of a command-line switch. As well as Power systems, Google is experimenting with ARM server-class chips and strives to be as platform agnostic as possible. The keyword here is experimenting: the vast majority of Google's production compute workloads right now run on Intel x86 processors. In fact, according to IDC, more than 95 per cent of the world's data center compute workloads run on Intel chips. Thus, to keep its supply options open, to keep Intel from price gouging it, and to evaluate competing hardware, Google test drives servers with non-x86 CPUs. It makes sense to widen your horizons. On Friday this week, Google stepped up from simply toying with gear from Intel's competitors to signaling it seriously hopes to deploy public cloud services powered by IBM Power chips. "We look forward to a future of heterogeneous architectures within our cloud," said John Zipfel, Google Cloud's technical program manager. This comes as Google shared draft blueprints for the Zaius P9 server: an OpenCAPI and Open-Compute-friendly box with an IBM Power9 scale-out microprocessor at its heart. That's the same Power9 the US government is using in its upcoming monster supercomputers. Google has worked with Rackspace, IBM and Ingrasys on the Zaius designs – you may recall that the Zaius concept was unveiled in April. The Zaius block diagram ... click to enlarge (Source: Google) OpenCAPI is the anyone-but-Intel interconnect fabric that emerged this week; the Zaius P9's OpenCAPI compatibility, and support for Nvidia's high-speed NVLink, further highlights Google's reluctance to be shackled to Intel. As well as supporting OpenCAPI, the Z9 has 16 channels of DDR4 memory, SATA and USB interfaces, gigabit Ethernet, BMC and serial access, and a bunch of PCIe gen-4 interfaces. It takes a 48V supply – a voltage level that apparently hits a sweet-spot for data center machines in terms of power and energy efficiency – and meets the Open Rack v2 standard. The blueprints will be submitted to the Open Compute Project (OCP) to evaluate and approve. Hyper-scale companies like Google and Facebook publish their server specifications so Asian hardware manufacturers can mass produce them on the cheap, relatively speaking. That way, cloud giants get to buy exactly what they want without having to negotiate deals with traditional server vendors like Hewlett Packard Enterprise. "We've shared these designs with the OCP community for feedback, and will submit them to the OCP Foundation later this year for review," explained Zipfel. "This is a draft specification of a preliminary, untested design, but we’re hoping that an early release will drive collaboration and discussion within the community." Aside from compute workloads, we understand Google uses customized Nvidia GPUs for its AI-powered Google Translate service, and no doubt in other platforms too alongside its machine-learning ASIC. It also uses a customized network controller with builtin intelligence to manage and access vast pools of cached information with low latency.

The neighbourhood that doesn't exist on Google Maps AOL Money UK 15/10/2016 Rosie Vare © Provided by AOL Money UK The celebrity neighbourhood that doesn't exist on Google Maps It's not unusual for celebrities to want a little privacy when it comes to their personal lives but what about when the media and paparazzi follow your every turn? This is what happens on a daily basis for stars like Kim Kardashian and her husband, Kanye West. After recently being the victim of a terrifying burglary while on holiday in Paris, it's not surprising the pair keep themselves to themselves at home. Hidden Hills is an exclusive neighbourhood in Los Angeles that is so private you won't even be able to find it on Google Maps. If you search for a property in the complex online, you won't be able to find it because as far as Google Maps is concerned, it's invisible. While the area does appear on the maps there are no details of any of the roads that are found in the neighbourhood. All of the 550 homes there cannot be seen on Google Street View. Google's high tech street cars that photograph homes are actually banned from entering the gated community. Usually when you type in an address on a public street Google Street view allows you to see each home from any angle you choose. You won't have much luck when it comes to Hidden Hills however, the function won't even let you move any further down the street. The discreet neighbourhood gives piece of mind to celebrities who spend their lives in the spotlight but want to do a disappearing act at home.

Dropbox users up until now could only use the service's own authentication system to create an account and sign in to it using apps, desktop clients or the web version. This changed recently as it is now possible to authenticate using a Google account. While that means association the account with Dropbox, the solution may be preferred by some users to unify accounts on the Internet. So, instead of having to use two accounts, one for Google and another for Dropbox, users could use Google for both. Dropbox: sign in with Google Users who are new to Dropbox can sign up to Dropbox using their Google account. This simplifies sign up as there is no need to specify a password for the account. You are probably wondering if the change applies to Dropbox users who have set an email from a different provider as their Dropbox account email. They don't directly. These users may change their Dropbox email address however to benefit from the new sign in option as well. Here is how that is done: Load https://www.dropbox.com/account/security#profile in the web browser of choice. You may need to sign in using your existing account depending on your preferences. You find a "change email" option under personal email on the main profile page. Follow the steps outlined there to switch it to your Google email address. You should have a Gmail address listed under personal email after the process. Once that is out of the way, you may use the "sign in with Google" option on Dropbox to sign in to the account. The first time you do that you are asked to add an account. Pick your account on the page that opens, or click on add account if it is not listed on that page. The next page lists the permissions that Dropbox requests. This includes viewing your email address, basic profile information, and managing your contacts. Please note that you cannot disallow this if you want to proceed. There is no option for instance to block Dropbox from accessing your contacts. This process works only if the personal email listed under the Dropbox account is identical to the Google email address. You will get an error message in the last step otherwise. Please note that Dropbox distinguishes between email addresses ending in gmail.com and googlemail.com. You will still be asked to enter the two-factor authentication code of the Dropbox account if you have enabled it for the account. Now You: Do you use Dropbox or do you prefer a different cloud storage provider? Summary Article Name Dropbox: sign in with Google Description Dropbox users who have associated a Google email address with their account may use Google directly now to sign in to their account.

But increasingly I am relying on OwnCloud running on my own little server. You should try it - it's way easier than you may think. In fact there are some companies out there selling mini PCs that are pre-configured to run OwnCloud services. Alternately, you can rent some server space from a hosting company. Either way, only *you* will have the encryption keys. You won't have to worry about Dropbox, or Dropbox's business partners.... Reply Uhtred October 17, 2016 at 9:49 pm # if memory serves me rightly, you can have several gmails for one main account, so if you used an alt gmail, would it still access all your contacts or just that "associated gmail contacts?" The dropbox-google thing might be good for some, but I prefer to keep my eggs in separate baskets. I've given up on dropbox software for destop, and manually access its site online via browser... not only does dropbox software repeatedly fire up its updater and so on, but each time it syncs I find on win 7 it trips my file explorer from details view to icon view, which is very annoying.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (12) Post your comment Confirmed: Pixels bought from Google are rootable, come with unlockable bootloaders 14 October 2016 Some of the purported disadvantages inherent when ordering a Google Pixel or Pixel XL from Verizon have been debunked already - the phones will ship with three bloatware apps, all of them uninstallable; software updates will be issued at the same time as for units bought elsewhere. One thing that's clear, however, is that Verizon's Pixels will not have unlockable bootloaders. That's not surprising given the carrier's general policy towards such things. But what about units purchased from Google? Sure, Nexus devices all had unlockable bootloaders, but the Pixels might be different in that regard, given the new branding and all. Thankfully, that's now been confirmed not to be the case. A Google spokesperson issued the following statement: Yes, Pixel owners who purchased the device from the Google store will be able to root their devices. Pixel phones purchased from the Google store will ship with an unlockable bootloader. That should make tinkerers everywhere happy. There is however one caveat, and it has to do with rooting and receiving over-the-air updates after that - or rather, not receiving them. Rooting involves modifying partitions on the phone. If the partitions are modified the OTA will fail to apply. So there you go. Some good news and some bad news. Anyway, all of this is bound to be relevant for just a small number of Pixel buyers, those interested in such things. The average Joe isn't likely to care either way.

By Hiawatha Bray Globe Staff  October 14, 2016 In the video posted on YouTube, former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz is his usual lively and opinionated self in a five-minute lecture on the history of Israel. Yet the popular Internet service has restricted access to the Dershowitz video, on the grounds it may not be suitable for children and other sensitive viewers. The video was published on a YouTube channel called Prager University, run by a conservative talk show host who said the service is blocking many similar talks by prominent intellectuals and media personalities. Advertisement The videos will not play when viewers have activated the YouTube setting, “restricted mode,” which is used to block possibly offensive content, such as sex, vulgar words or intense violence. How the Dershowitz video got blocked is unclear, as it does not contain violence or swear words. Other restricted Prager University videos feature former Harvard Kennedy School fellow Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and comedian Adam Carolla. But the talk show host, Dennis Prager, said the explanation seems clear: Alphabet Inc., the giant Internet conglomerate that owns Google and YouTube, is actively attempting to suppress conservative viewpoints. Get Business Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here “Given no rational response for the restrictions, there seems to be little reason to suspect anything other than suppression of conservative thought,”said Prager. YouTube said its restrictions are applied by computers, not humans with a political bias. And a statement from Google added that some of the restricted videos included sensitive topics such as rape and terrorism, and therefore may not be suitable for all audiences. However, a YouTube search turned up other videos on the same topics that are not blocked in restricted mode. Youtube screenshot A look at the video when the restricted mode is turned on. Dershowitz, for his part, does not believe YouTube deliberately censored him, but rather its filters somehow tripped up. Advertisement “I can’t believe that Google would actually censor a pro-Israel speech by me, when it has so much anti-Israel stuff all over its platform,” said Dershowitz. “It has to be a mistake ... I’ve been doing this for 50 years and this is the first time in America that my views have been restricted,” he said. The YouTube incident is one several recent allegations that major Internet companies are deliberately censoring right-of-center online activities. In May, Facebook was accused of slanting the news headlines that appear in its Trending Topics feature to suppress news from conservative media outlets. In addition, Twitter has been charged with banning conservative users for posting hateful online comments, while tolerating equally hostile language from people with left-wing views. On Thursday, Christina Hoff Sommers, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said YouTube had placed viewing restrictions on a number of her videos in which she criticizes feminism. One of the restricted videos, for example, is “Are Men Obsolete?” which praises innate differences between men and women. The Prager YouTube channel features about 150 videos, each about five minutes long. All can be seen if viewers do not turn on “restricted mode.” The videos are mini-lectures on topics from feminism to religion to foreign policy, presented from a conservative point of view. Prager said the videos collectively have been viewed 120 million times in 2016 alone. The speakers in each lecture are spirited, but temperate in tone; there are no raised voices or swear words, though Carolla’s video contains the word “crap.” Prager said that he spent months pressing YouTube and Google to explain the restrictions and have them lifted. The company did restore full access to some of the videos, although not Dershowitz’s, but then added others to the restricted list. Prager said he received an e-mail response from YouTube that said, “this is working as intended according to the nature of restricted mode function ... We aim to apply the same standards to everyone and we don’t censor anyone. Often it’s not the right approach to say that videos with the same topic should get the same rating. We’ll need to take into consideration what the intent of the video is, what the focus of the video is, what the surrounding metadata of the video explains.” It is possible that YouTube viewers themselves are to blame. Viewers are allowed to “flag” videos they deem inappropriate and YouTube said its staff reviews them “to determine whether they violate Community Guidelines.” This implies that humans rather than computers can decide to restrict access to some videos. The company would not provide more details on how its system works. A YouTube spokesperson said the use of the word “crap” in Carolla’s video, along with other aspects of the video he did not describe, might result in an access restriction. Such decisions, the spokesperson said, were made by YouTube computers that analyze millions of videos using complex algorithms that identify a variety of factors that might justify a restriction. Facebook also said it uses computers rather than people to make editorial decisions, to avoid human biases. But humans must program the computers, and the companies have not disclosed the guidelines they use to tell computers when to restrict content. However, in May, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg met with prominent conservatives to assure them that his company won’t serve up biased information. The next month Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt said publicly his company is strictly nonpartisan. “We always had policy that the company does not have a policy in these areas,” he said. Some conservatives are pushing back. A Donald Trump supporter has launched a Twitter rival called Gab, that will tolerate any speech so long as it doesn’t incite criminal conduct. Entrepreneurs in Texas started a social network called Codias, explicitly aimed at conservatives who feel slighted by Facebook. Hiawatha Bray can be reached at hiawatha.bray@globe.com.

Monday 14 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 06:31 / GMT - 03:01 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Fri Oct 14, 2016 2:59 Google's Large Pixel XL, Nexus 6P Stalk Galaxy Note 7 Demise Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- With Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 effectively dead, Google’s new phones are shaping up to be strong stand-ins. The first pure Google-branded phones could not have arrived at a better time. “Google’s new Pixel phone will be an attractive option to high-end Android phone owners,” Bob O’Donnell, president and founder of TECHnalysis Research, told me in an email. New survey not encouraging for Samsung: a new survey may be a harbinger of good news for Google (via TechCrunch) but bad news for Samsung. “The fall of the Galaxy Note 7 has Samsung’s smartphone customers seeking new brands,” the October 13 press release from e-commerce firm Branding Brand said.  The survey, conducted October 11-12, said 8% of those surveyed will buy a Google Pixel, a change since the original survey published on September 23. That’s surprising, considering the Pixel was just announced and still has relatively little exposure. The newer survey also said that 40% of current Samsung consumers say “they won’t buy another phone from the brand — that’s a 6% increase since the first week of the phone’s U.S. recall on Sept. 15,” according to Branding Brand’s press release, titled “Google Pixel Takes a Bite Out of Samsung’s Declining Consumer Base.” Results of the survey included: 8% will buy a Google Pixel (new since original survey). 30% will switch to iPhone (down from 34%). 62% will go with another Android phone (up from 57%). Pixel XL: Looking at a specific Pixel model, consumers who had been snapping up the large 5.7-inch Galaxy Note 7 before the recall could see the 5.5-inch Pixel XL as a strong option. The XL is priced at $869 (128GB), very close to the 64GB Galaxy Note 7, which is (was) priced at around $850 at most U.S. carriers. Like the Note 7, the Pixel XL comes with an AMOLED display with a 2,560-by-1440 resolution. And other internal specs are similar to the Note 7, including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon quad-core 820 processor (which Google lists as the “821”), 4GB of RAM, a USB-C connector, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. And both have advanced 12-megapixel-class cameras. But Google is claiming chart-topping image quality, with a “best-ever” 89 DxOMark Mobile score, a widely-cited yardstick for photo quality. An often-overlooked feature of the new Google Pixel phones is the option for Project Fi, a wireless service from Google, which automatically connects you to the best available signal, whether that’s Wi-Fi or one of three 4G LTE partner networks. That can result in lower — sometimes substantially lower — monthly charges. The problem Google’s faces is supply. All versions of the Pixel XL are now listed as “out of stock.” So, as of October 14, when you order one, you are placed on a waiting list. Earlier survey points to the Nexus 6P as a beneficiary: The 5.7-inch Google Nexus 6P, co-branded with Huawei, is also a good stand-in, according to another survey. After the Note 7 recall, “the big winner was the Google Nexus 6P,” said Mobile analytics firm Apteligent. The Nexus 6P was followed by the LG G5, according to Apteligent. The Nexus 6P, like the Note 7, has a large 5.7-inch AMOLED display, and a 64GB version is available on Amazon for $500 (more or less, depending on Amazon’s pricing which can fluctuate daily), a steal for a “phablet”-class phone. iPhone 7 Plus, others may benefit too: TECHnalysis’ O’Donnell believes the shift from the Note 7 “will benefit the iPhone 7 as well.” And Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty said last month that “over 30% of iPhone demand in recent quarters has come from ex-Android users, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery issues and recall might drive additional demand, especially for the iPhone 7 Plus,” she said in a note to investors. Other low-cost 5.5-inch alternatives include the 64GB ZTE Axon 7 (priced on Amazon at around $500) and the 32GB Motorola Z, priced at $624 at Verizon.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Battle for Mosul Day 27: Iraqi Forces Win Back Ancient City of Nimrud Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- After seizing control of Dhahiat al-Assad and Menyan in the weekend, the Syrian army and popular forces continued their advances against the terrorist groups in New Aleppo, Jamiat al-Mostaqbal, Menyan and al-Hamdaniyeh regions.

But Google didn’t say anything about new wearable devices even though rumors preceding the event did say that Google is working on its own wearable devices. DON’T MISS: Here’s how Samsung might kill the Galaxy Note brand without actually killing it Well-informed Evan Blass said on Twitter that Google hasn’t given up on its smartwatch plans. But the devices, supposed to run Android Wear 2.0, will not be launched this year. Instead, they’ll be launched at some point in the first quarter of 2017. https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/786665339652157440 Google unveiled Android Wear 2.0 at Google I/O this year, but it looks like the final version of the wearable Android OS will be launched next year. Android Police, the first site that mentioned Google’s Angelfish and Swordfish watches, says that multiple companies will not release new Android Wear devices this year. It’s unclear whether Google is delaying Android Wear 2.0 because there’s no new hardware for it, or whether it’s the other way around. Google’s rumored watches do not have commercial names yet, and it's not known whether they'll be Pixel-branded. Angelfish is the larger model that will offer LTE and GPS support and will work without needing to be tethered to a phone. The Swordfish is the smaller model that will lack LTE and GPS. It’s also supposed to be cheaper than the Angelfish. Apple, meanwhile, is already selling a second-generation Apple Watch in stores, alongside an updated first-gen model. Both devices run Apple's latest watchOS 3.0 update.

This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google will sunset photo-sharing site Panoramio as it focuses on building out features in Google Maps, Digital Trends reports. For context, Panoramio allows users to upload and share their photos by location on Google Maps and Google Earth. However, Google would like users to upload their photos using its inbuilt tool instead. The announcement is just the latest effort by the company to position Maps as a social platform and primary discovery tool, thereby making it more appealing to advertisers and marketers. Most recently, for example, Google gave users the ability to add locations and confirm suggested edits, making Maps much more personalized and accurate. Additionally, it added search ads to Maps so that local businesses surface when users make related inquiries. But Google is also relying on Maps as a driver in the artificial intelligence (AI) race,according to Google Maps head Jen Fitzpatrick. Having spent almost two decades investing in mapping endeavors, the company has accumulated massive amounts of mapping data, giving it the upper hand over the likes of Apple, Tesla, and Facebook. It makes sense that Google would base much of its future AI abilities on this data. Integrating more capabilities into Maps is one way to entice users to use the service more regularly, inputting even more data, and giving Maps even more user data to feed its AI.  To receive stories like this one directly to your inbox every morning, sign up for the Apps and Platforms Briefing newsletter. Click here to learn more about how you can gain risk-free access today.

So what can you do about it? We’re not sure if Verizon ever plans on changing their policy, but if you want a Pixel phone with an unlocked bootloader, you’ll have to buy it from Google. According to Android.WonderHowTo, they have confirmed with Google that the bootloaders on the Pixel phones bought directly from them will be unlockable. This is according to Google spokesperson Iska Saric who said, “Yes, Pixel owners who purchased the device from the Google store will be able to root their devices. Pixel phones purchased from the Google store will ship with an unlockable bootloader.” So what does this mean? As we had previously covered, an unlocked bootloader means that users will have deeper access to their phones than from before. Users will be able to do more with their phones and run tweaks/tools that might require superuser/admin privileges, such as installing custom ROMs and so on. For the average Android user who doesn’t bother with these kinds of things, we guess it probably won’t matter, but if you fancy yourself a tinkerer then perhaps purchasing the phone directly from Google might be a better idea.

National security letters allow the FBI to covertly subpoena data from companies without having to get a court order, so long as the requests are relevant to active investigations related to either terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. Google did not offer details beyond the existence of the letter. The report and the accompanying blog entry did, however offer other details showing growing government requests for data from Google, revealing FISA requests covering between 21,000 and 21,499 Google accounts, a significant increase from the previous year’s 16,000-16,499. The government severely limits the ability of companies to make the exact details of their surveillance public, with gag orders keeping some actions secret outright, and even Google’s data on FISA requests is only allowed in “ranges” because they’re forbidden by law from giving exact numbers.

By Ethan Baron / October 14, 2016 at 5:11 PM Donald said this and Hillary said that. Was one of them lying or distorting the truth? Both of them? Google wants to help you find out. The Mountain View company has rolled out its new fact-check links for Google News stories just in time for the election — sort of. The company received widespread media coverage for its announcement Thursday that “fact check” labels would be added to stories on the Google News mobile app. By clicking on the arrow next to a headline, readers would see a “fact check” tag beside a link to an article by a reputable fact-checking publication that has checked the facts at issue in the article. However, cursory surveys of news stories in the Google News app on Thursday and Friday found none of the new fact check tags. A Google spokeswoman said that “some stories” had the fact check tag. “But it will likely take a few weeks as other publications leverage the tag,” the spokeswoman said. So it remains to be seen how useful the new links will be in sorting out truth from fiction in advance of presidential election day Nov. 8. In any case, Google is courting political controversy by offering the feature, according to a Los Angeles Times article Friday. “Google may take criticism based on the publishers it deems eligible for its fact-check label,” the article said. Problems could arise over Google’s determination of which fact-checking publications are legitimate. While organizations dedicated to fact-checking, such as the International Fact-Checking Network, could have their tags linking to their articles, it’s over which media outlets would qualify that could generate disputes, according to the Los Angeles Times. “A Google spokeswoman said newspapers like the Los Angeles Times could use the fact-check tag. But when asked whether conservative news sites Breitbart News or progressive publication Mother Jones would be eligible, she declined to comment and referred back to the company’s guidelines,” the article said.   Photo: The campus-network room at a Google data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa.  (AP Photo/Google, Connie Zhou, File) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: App, fact check, fact checking, Google, Google News app   More Posts in 1 Petition for electoral college coup against Trump gets more than 1 million signatures November 10, 2016   Apple now selling pre-owned iPhones from online store November 9, 2016   Google’s driving app ‘Android Auto’ now works as free standalone on phones November 8, 2016       Share this Post Tweet       dalethorn Trust google to fact-check?

The phones will soon be available in stores, and Google released a couple of new TV commercials for the Pixels. Meanwhile, in Australia, a few lucky buyers have already received the phones, thanks to a delivery mistake. DON’T MISS: Here’s how Samsung might kill the Galaxy Note brand without actually killing it Google’s new Pixel commercials are somewhat on the stranger side of town. Called Together by you and Crush by you, the short ads seem to indicate that the Pixel are a natural transition from a desktop Google experience to a mobile one. In both ads, the image on the screen morphs from what looks like a browser’s search bar to a mobile phone. This is probably a subliminal hint to the Google Assistant that resides on the phones. That said, the ads do not highlight any particular feature of the Pixel phones, which is what you’d expect from such commercials, not even the Assistant. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o9NmuZ8Qls https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0yIO_FX608 However, Google did mention one hidden feature of Google Pixel phones in a statement to WonderHowTo. The phones will be rootable out of the box. “Pixel owners who purchased the device from the Google store will be able to root their devices. Pixel phones purchased from the Google store will ship with an unlockable bootloader,” Google said. Come October 20th when the phone launches, you’ll be able to try to root the phone yourself, if you’ve got the skills. That said, at least one buyer in Australia has already received the phone ahead of launch, as local carrier Telstra made a shipping mistake.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Oct 14, 2016 at 7:09PM Image source: Snapchat. We may be close to one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of the last few years. The Wall Street Journal reports Snap, Inc. -- formerly known as Snapchat -- could make its IPO as early as March. Snap is one of the most highly valued private companies. Its last round of funding valued the company at $18 billion. The Journal says the company is eyeing a value of $25 billion or more for its IPO. Snap's decision to use the public market to raise capital is a smart move for several reasons. Here's a glimpse at Snap's possible rationale for its planned IPO. Its competition is much better capitalized Snap entered the digital advertising market just a couple years ago, and two of its biggest competitors happen to have mountains of cash on their balance sheets. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- the parent company of Google -- has $78.5 billion on its balance sheet. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has $23.3 billion. For Snap to compete with the two biggest names in digital advertising, it will need to continue to innovate in both ad technology and its ad formats. That takes investments in engineers and other creatives to bring new products to market. Snap has also shown an interest in developing products outside of Snapchat. The most recent example are its Spectacles glasses, which may act as a loss leader for Snap. Snap could also use the proceeds to help acquire smaller technology companies in augmented reality. Snapchat's $25 billion valuation is likely its best way to raise capital at this point. The price represents nearly a 27 times multiple of its expected 2017 revenue. By comparison, Facebook's $81 billion IPO valued it at just 13.5 times its expected revenue. Google's $23 billion valuation at its IPO ended up being just seven times its 2004 revenue. For investors, that may be a sign that Snap will be overvalued when it makes its initial offering. However, history has shown that both Facebook and Google were dramatically undervalued, and investors would have made excellent returns by investing at their respective IPO prices. Attracting talent with stock-based compensation Love it or hate it, stock-based compensation is an important tactic used by a lot of companies that aren't yet producing tons of cash to pay their employees. Even with their significant cash flows, Facebook and Google still use a significant amount of stock-based compensation. Employees are much more attracted to company stock options that are traded on public markets. Not only are they able to see the exact market value of their stock holdings, it's easily liquidated if need be. As such, an IPO could help Snap attract more and better talent to its company in order to compete with the Facebooks and Googles of the world. There's something to be said for over-reliance on stock-based compensation, though, and investors will want to pay attention to Snapchat's numbers when it releases detailed financial reports. Relying on stock-based compensation works fine if the stock price rises, but employees aren't happy when the stock declines. They're effectively getting a pay cut when that happens, and it can cause a lot of top talent to look for work elsewhere. Attracting bigger and better customers Becoming a publicly traded company brings an air of trust that a privately held start-up just doesn't have. Publicly traded companies are required to disclose a lot more information than private companies, and give a sense that the company is much more established -- even though there are tons of well-established companies that aren't publicly traded. That's important for Snap considering it's going after the big fish in advertising. In fact, Snap is practically exclusively reliant on big-brand advertising for its ad revenue. Google and Facebook, by comparison, count millions of small businesses as active advertisers. Going public will help Snap open those wallets by giving the advertisers a sense of stability in the ad platform on which they're spending millions of dollars. That's also important because Facebook has been copying some of Snapchat's best features across several of its products. The most obvious example is Instagram's new Stories feature, which Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom even admitted was a copy. The feature already has 100 million active users. If and when Instagram decides to insert ads into stories, advertisers may be more likely to buy into it because it's backed by Facebook and its well-established reputation in the digital advertising space. Snap needs to develop a similarly strong brand and reputation. The move to take Snap public is certainly no snap decision. The company will have to disclose a lot more information as a publicly traded company, which could be beneficial to its competition. But the benefits certainly outweigh that small downside for Snap.

Two POWER9 CPUs can plug into a Zaius motherboard and each LaGrange CPU has support for up to 32 DIMM memory slots. Going a step further, the POWER9 CPUs can each support a set of 8 lanes NVLink/OpenCAPI interconnect at up to 25 Gbps. OpenCAPI is a new effort to build an Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface and is supported by AMD, Google, Mellanox and Micron among the group's founding members. The promise of OpenCAPI is the 25 Gbps data rate, which is faster than the current maximum throughput on PCIe, which is 16 Gbps. "OpenCAPI can advance the future of server design by enabling higher performance for data-intensive workloads and the emerging accelerator ecosystem," "Chris Johnson, Principal Engineer, Google, said in a statement. In addition to making use of the IBM POWER9 LaGrange CPU and OpenCAPI, Zaius will also make use of new Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) technology. "The Zaius BMC software is being developed using Open BMC, the framework for which we’ve released on GitHub," John Zipfel, Technical Program Manager at Google, wrote in a blog post. "Additionally, Zaius will support a PCIe Gen4 x16 OCP 2.0 mezzanine slot NIC." The draft design of the Zaius has been shared with the Open Compute Platform (OCP) community and could become a standard future reference design.

OEMs still have the option of including Hangouts, but are no longer required to do so and will have to replace it with Duo, Google’s video calling app. Now it seems that Google themselves are following the new rules that they have set out because according to a report from Chrome Unboxed, they have obtained a screenshot from the upcoming Pixel phones which shows that Google Hangouts has been disabled on the phone in favor of both Allo and Duo. Now the disabling of Hangouts doesn’t really mean that much. Users can quickly re-enable the app via the Play Store, so it’s just a slight inconvenience at most, although we’re guessing that users who are less savvy might be frustrated when they try to look for the app. Now Google has stated that Hangouts will be aimed more towards its business users so this move isn’t all that surprising.

This page is meant to get new hires, interns, or interested community members up to speed with the right software, configurations, and communication channels to contribute effectively to the release engineering pipeline. Video Introductions Release Engineering as a Force Multiplier by John O'Duinn (former director) about how Mozilla Release Engineering handles our business and how we work to improve each and every day. This crowd-sourced video list contains other videos about various aspects of working at Mozilla, including important information such as how to operate the espresso machine. Development Best Practices Read and keep up to date with: Development Best Practices Read and keep up to date with: http://moz-releng-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ Please fix any issues you find: https://github.com/mozilla/build-relengdocs As someone new to the project, your fresh perspective helps shine a light on missing information or assumptions we take for granted. Single Sign-On (SSO) Many Mozilla services use SSO now, including Gmail, Drive, and ServiceNow. The Single Sign-On homepage has a list of the available services. NOTE: SSO requires that LDAP be setup first. Mail Mozilla mail is handled by Gmail now. You should be added to the release@mozilla.com google group as a new hire/intern. This mailing list is managed by Google groups. Owners of this group will be able to add you. Send a test message to release@m.c to verify that your address has been added/subscribed. Talk to your manager if it is not working. WARNING: release@m.c can contain security-sensitive information. Do not automatically forward your email to a system that is not under Mozilla's control. Mailing lists You'll need to manually subscribe to: release-engineering public mailing list mozilla.dev.planning mozilla.dev.tree-management These are available as newsgroups, google groups, and Mailman lists Mail Filtering With all that new email, you will want to set up some filters in Gmail (https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters) to filter some of the higher-volume automated mail into a folder. You may eventually want to handle this information, but on day one hundreds of nagios notifications are not going to be educational. Here is an imperfect set of Gmail filters that you can import to get you started. A list of new (and some older) automated emails are indexed by subject, along with relevant actions, here. If you are going to working on puppet, you should also look at this page on how to read releng shared emails. Calendar Like mail, we now use Google calendar. You'll want to subscribe to the following public calendars: Release Engineering - Public Releng PTO Talk to your manager/mentor to get added to the various other private calendars as appropriate. Access Bugzilla Almost everything at Mozilla goes through Bugzilla. Create a Bugzilla account if you have not already. You'll need a few tweaks to your account to get access to everything releng-related: Add privileges for bugzilla group "build" (Mozilla Build Team) (Can be done by coop, catlee, hwine, or bugzilla admin.) Add your irc nickname & ldap username as "aliases" for your account log into bugzilla & follow links "Preferences" -> "Account Information" append the aliases, with a leading ':' and enclosed in brackets ('[]') to the "Real Name" field e.g.: "Hal Wine [:hwine]" Excellent video showing how to do power searches: Bugzilla Quick Search (5 minutes you NEED to give yourself) QuickSearch help Filing bugs against Release Engineering The product to use is, unsurprisingly, "Release Engineering." There are multiple possible components under that product, so take your best guess or ask for guidance in IRC. LDAP, SSH, VPN Warning for people who already have an LDAP account: Change your password. Otherwise, adding you to the releng group may lock your account without further notice. There is a stronger password policy in releng: users must change their password every 3 months. If you don't change your password, the only symptom will be that one day or another (already observed after 8 days), your regular password won't work anymore. If this happens to you, contact people in #servicedesk, they will be able to reset your password. This is mostly applicable only to employees and interns, although it *is* possible for other contributors to acquire some limited LDAP access. Speak to someone you work with on the releng team if you would like to investigate this. SSH keys are used for access to most machines, and some of them are stored in your LDAP record: Add your SSH public key to your LDAP account, at https://login.mozilla.com/ You'll need a number of other bits set in your LDAP object to access releng networks and systems via the VPN. Full instructions for accessing the VPN are on mana. this usually starts by generating a certificate at https://login.mozilla.com/ file a bug against Product/Component: Infrastructure & Operations/MOC: Service Requests asking to be added to the releng and vpn_releng groups. Something similar to bug 1223449 If you're on MacOSX or Windows, you might want to request a license for Viscosity (A VPN client). To do so from service-now. 'Order Stuff' > 'Software Applications' > 'Viscosity VPN' > 'Buisness Support && follow onscreen instructions Your manager is responsible for making sure you belong to the following LDAP groups, ideally before your first day: cn=balrog,ou=groups,dc=mozilla
cn=corp-vpn,ou=groups,dc=mozilla
cn=CrashReportsAdmin,ou=groups,dc=mozilla

 Common Machines Once your SSH public key is associated with your LDAP record, you should have access a number of shared Mozilla hosts: people.mozilla.org (account is not automatic, use service-now to request). hg.mozilla.org (use full email address as username) (commit access is not automatic, see below for access) Build Machines Releng runs many, many machines, including: staging and production buildbot masters staging and production slaves servers hosting a variety of services a handful of shared releng machines for development We access these machines via SSH (all), VNC (all), or remote desktop (Windows), depending on the context of the activity we're performing. To add your SSH key to the buildslaves, you'll need to do something like bug 899315. File a bug in "Release Engineering: Platform Support" Checkout the puppet repo and create a patch Ask for a reviewer. Your mentor/manager are good options here. If you need an account on cruncher (shared releng machine), ask catlee, and send him your SSH public key. (If you aren't sure you need the account, you probably do not for now.) SSH Config You'll want to update your ~/.ssh/config accordingly: Host hg.mozilla.org git.mozilla.org
    User <short-ldap-name-here>@mozilla.com
    Compression yes
    ServerAliveInterval 300

Host *.mozilla.com
    User <short-ldap-name-here>
    Compression yes
    ServerAliveInterval 300

Host *.build.mozilla.org
    Compression yes
    User cltbld
    ServerAliveInterval 300 Mercurial (hg) Most development in releng (and at Mozilla writ-large) is stored in version control using hg. There is an excellent step-by-step guide for setting up and using hg: Mercurial for Mozillians The root webview of the Mozilla hg repositories is here: https://hg.mozilla.org/ Most releng code lives in repos under https://hg.mozilla.org/build There are 3 levels of commit access: Level 1 access allows you to use the Try Server and setup user repos. As a new contributor, you should request this on day one. Level 2 access is required to land code in the build and project repos. Once you have a proven track record of successful patches, you can ask your manager/mentor to vouch for your Level 2 access. Your manager/mentor can also land patches for you until you receive Level 2 access. Level 3 access is required to land code directly on mozilla-central and its derived release branches. At some point in your Mozilla contribution story, you may need Level 3 access but many contributors never do. Talk to your manager/mentor if you think you need this access. You should already have Level 2 access when you request Level 3. You need to file an IT bug to get hg commit access. Follow the instructions for Becoming a Mozilla Committer, and for Level 2, specify you need access to (at least) hg.mozilla.org/build/* (Product/Component: mozilla.org/Repository Account Requests). example request: bug 703351 Git & Github There are git mirrors of many popular Mozilla repositories. One of the Mozilla github admins (catlee, coop) can add you to the following GitHub groups: Mozilla-Releng organization Releng team within the Mozilla organization There are also a handful of git repos hosted directly by Mozilla. Your manager/mentor will let you know if you need access to one of these. (See also) PGP PGP keys are used for encrypting sensitive data - you are responsible for generating and managing you own keys. A quick, Mac-focused primer is available on the intranet or you can use the The GNU Privacy Handbook for reference. After you have created your keys, do try to get your key signed by other team members, and uploaded to gpg.mozilla.org. It is okay to reuse an existing gpg key, provided you add an additional ID for your canonical LDAP name (e.g. 'hwine [at] mozilla.com', not an alias like 'Hal_9001 [at] mozilla.com'). Other Services For access to other services, you'll need file a couple of bugs: Access to Nagios File a bug in bugzilla under 'MOC: Service Requests' Access to inventory File a bug under 'Infrastructure & Operations::WebOps: Inventory' Communication IRC The majority of day-to-day communication in releng happens on IRC: https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC irc://irc.mozilla.org irc.mozilla.org:6697 #mozbuild (use SSL, ask for the channel key; your nick needs to be registered) private team channel  * /attach ircs://irc.mozilla.org:6697/?pass=[your_irc_pass]
 * /join #mozbuild [access_key] irc.mozilla.org #releng public channel for discussion with sherrifs, and continuous integration bot keywords to hilite on: "!squirrel" is "I need eyes on this now" keyword in #mozbuild & #releng- please set your client to alert on it. "r?" - team member looking for a review, perhaps not in but (irc/pastebin) also useful to join #developers, #airmozilla, #sf, #mobile, #planning, #release-drivers, #ateam, #infra #sysadmins access_key is here https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SYSADMIN/IRC+use+within+IT #moco [access_key is here [n]] #firebot for hiliting when you're mentioned in a bug, review request, etc. http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/faq/#connect Many folks run a BNC (an IRC bouncer) (e.g. znc) and/or irssi under screen to get continuous view of traffic. Ask around. (some good irssi notes) See below for a local pastebin install, so you don't paste huge amounts in channel. IT now also provides a hosted IRCCloud cloud instance you can partake of. NOTE: if you're using IRCCloud, and are invited to a password protected channel, IRCCloud will not have the password available to re-connect you. Do the following as soon as you enter the channel: Click the "Options" button Copy the password Click the "Leave" button Click the "Rejoin" button Paste the password into the text box. Wiki If you're reading this now, you found the wiki! ;) Please add yourself and details to the list of team members. Don't be shy about making improvements to releng pages based on your experiences. Getting someone in releng to review your changes first is good practice. Just ask in #releng. Useful templates (aka "macros") for releng, use bug 999 for bugzilla references; 6e453b4f7056 for hg revisions is also quite nice. Pastebin There's a local pastebin instance at http://pastebin.mozilla.org/, so you don't need to paste multi-lines into a channel. You'll find a helper script in the braindump repo at utils/pastebin. it creates a new page from stdin, and outputs the url to stdout an argument will be interpretted as the syntax highlighting format to use sample usage: hg diff | pastebin python | pbcopy (last part mac specific) set & export PASTEBIN_NAME if you don't want to post as anonymous. (Many folks now use the pastebin integrated into IRCCloud.) Google Drive Google Drive (formerly Google docs) is a preferred way to share things these days. This includes spreadsheets and documents that will change a great deal over time. Google Drive access should be enabled with your email account when you start. If you need access to a particular document, talk to the document owner or your manager/mentor. Mana Some internal Mozilla systems (IT, HR) are documented on mana. File a ServiceNow ticket if you don't have access when you start. Vidyo Services Our primary two way video meeting platform is Vidyo. Basic usage instructions are here. Especially if you are running linux, it is highly recommended that you install the client and make test calls prior to any meeting. Many of our team meetings are held in the ReleaseEngineering room. Pro tip: many folks have found the mobile client useful to have preinstalled as a backup device. If you're going to record a meeting, practice first. (Instructions are linked from mana page.)

The Chromebook Pro was prematurely posted on a couple of retailers' websites and even had its own landing page on Samsung’s site before admins became aware of the error. Fortunately, the crew over at Chrome Unboxed managed to get the skinny on the system’s specs before those pages disappeared. Codenamed Kevin, the Chromebook Pro features a 12.3-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 2,400 x 1,600 (234 PPI, 400 nits, 3:2 ratio) that can also be rotated 360 degrees. It’ll be powered by a 2GHz hexa-core ARM processor and 4GB of RAM with 32GB of local flash storage on tap. The all-aluminum chassis looks absolutely gorgeous with curved edges akin to what you’d find on a flagship smartphone. At just 2.38 pounds and 13.9mm at its thickest point, Samsung’s latest is plenty portable. Battery life checks in at up to 10 hours and interestingly enough, the system includes a stylus for taking full advantage of the sea of Android apps out there – an oversized Galaxy Note, if you will. If leaks prove accurate, Samsung’s Chromebook Pro will go on sale October 24 priced at $499. That’s a bit more than something like Acer’s excellent Chromebook 14 yet far cheaper than Google’s overpriced Chromebook Pixel. Given the hardware and aesthetics, it is likely well worth the asking price.

So let’s wrap for today: Family First senator Bob Day has resigned from the Senate. He will be replaced by a nominee of the party’s choice. Former Tasmanian Liberal MP Eric Hutchinson has got a parliamentary job with Senate president Stephen Parry using a special allocation from the PM’s office for his presidential role. Luckily for the Liberal party, it will require lots of representation of the “president” in Tasmania, where the party lost three seats. Tony Abbott has tried to tempt Nick Xenophon into changing 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act. Xenophon says nope, nope, nope. Labor is meeting at a hastily called caucus meeting to calm factional tensions as a result of Shorten’s captain call of Kimberley Kitching to replace Stephen Conroy. Malcolm Turnbull has suggested Labor’s Mark Dreyfus was endangering national security by asking questions about a citizenship bill – telling him to get on “Team Australia”. Attorney general George Brandis has been verbally jousting with Penny Wong all day in Senate estimates. We learned the ministerial standards statements on lobbying mean not very much. We learned that the luggage lift in the Lodge, approved under the Abbott regime, cost $83,500. We learned the Coalition agreement between Turnbull and Barnaby Joyce has not been sighted by anyone in the Prime Minister and Cabinet Department. Tomorrow, estimates will focus on George Brandis’s department. Also tomorrow the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority will give evidence – the body that the deputy prime minister has unilaterally decided would move to his electorate. NBN Co is on tomorrow afternoon. Thanks to Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Katharine Murphy for their contributions. Thanks to Mike Bowers for his pictures. Goodnight. Updated at 3.10am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.00am EDT 03:00 Katharine Murphy The lively day in Canberra is powering right through to close of business. As we speak the Labor left is having a specially convened caucus meeting to deal with tensions that have boiled over since Bill Shorten last Friday night backed his friend and factional ally, the controversial lawyer Kimberley Kitching, to replace the departing Stephen Conroy. Let’s keep this as simple as possible. Tensions in the Victorian left have been bubbling away for months, ever since the majority of the faction tried to run the veteran leftwing powerbroker, Kim Carr, off the front bench. Folks aligned with Carr have been cranky that some of their Victorian colleagues lined up with colleagues in Sydney to try and remove Carr from the frontbench after the election. Let’s call that a pre-existing condition. Then there was the Kitching transaction last week. Victorian Labor has been absolutely off the long run since Shorten decided he wanted Kitching in the Senate. Normally sedate people were quite literally tearing their hair out over that turn of events. Shorten was advised in the strongest possible terms not to bring Kitching to Canberra, that it would stir up animosities in the Labor caucus. It appears to have done exactly that. Gavin Marshall (a long time Carr ally) decided to tell Fairfax Media early on Monday that he might come after a couple of sitting MPs in the left when preselection time rolled around. He named Andrew Giles and Catherine King, the shadow health minister. Folks should know by way of background that Marshall lost a position he held in the last parliament, deputy Senate president, in the fight over Carr and the front bench. Clearly he’s not that happy about it, and thought he might have a vent about people he views as being disloyal. The non-Carr left is now unhappy to put it mildly, hence tonight’s special caucus meeting to determine whether peace can be declared, or whether things escalate. We can cut to the chase here, now all the background has been declared. Bill Shorten is the leader of the Labor party because he was underpinned institutionally by support from Conroy (now departed) and Carr (now the subject of acrimony from his factional fellow travellers). That underpinning has been eroded since Conroy’s departure. The caucus is something of a tinderbox after the Kitching decision. That might sound like an exaggeration, but it isn’t. Malcolm Turnbull once talked about exciting times. Seems, they are catching.

Asked if his party was considering supporting a change, Xenophon told Guardian Australia: “the answer is no, no and no. I’ve spoken to my colleagues and we agree: not only is there no proposal, there is no pipeline.” I am deeply offended at the suggestion of any change in section 18C – but I realise my complaint is not actionable. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.52am EDT 01:52 Tony Abbott has regularly come back to his proposal to amend 18C post prime ministership, despite having dropped it from his government’s agenda in order to deal with national security issues. Now he is seeking what is known around the traps as a more minimalist proposal, which would remove the words insult and offend from section 18c, notwithstanding the free speech provisions in 18d. It seems unlikely that Nick Xenophon would overturn his opposition to amending the Racial Discrimination Act. But hey, we have put in the call.

The regulator announced on Friday that it would maintain regulation of the service, with its declaration paper noting that even Telstra “broadly supported” maintaining the declaration of the service. When a service is "declared" by the ACCC it regulates its price, availability, and/or contract terms. The regulator does so in order to level the playing field in a market where one or more players have a structural advantage. With Telstra being the only game in town for telephone exchanges it's not hard to see why the ACCC may be interested in setting some rules, notwithstanding other carrier's ability to put their own infrastructure into those exchanges. Telstra had tried to get the declaration lifted for exchange areas where there are multiple providers, but the ACCC declined. The draft declaration (PDF) notes that investment in other broadband services – for example, the unconditioned local loop (ULL – the “naked copper” that companies like TPG buy when they've installed DSL equipment in a Telstra exchange) – is declining, because providers don't want their investment stranded when the NBN arrives. The regulator argues, therefore, that continued regulation gives Telstra's competitors a service they can resell to customers without getting burned by the NBN. The draft declaration is open for further submissions until 14 November 2016. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Telstra's CRM system breached competition undertaking: ACCC Overall, SSU compliance is improving Telstra being paid to fix Telstra's network for NBN – AGAIN Another AU$1.6b heading back to the Big T to work on a network it sold to nbn 11 Comments nbnTM names six shops to re-build Telstra's HFC network And TITSUP Telstra gets to manage them all 6 Comments Australian telecoms regulator watching over Telstra HFC/NBN deal ACCC tells Telstra's right hand to pay no attention to left hand Union: Telstra seeking 120 redundancies in network ops team NBN contract miss puts pressure on field staff nbn™ switches on first Telstra HFC-powered broadband services 100/40Mbps services available to 2,300 Perth homes 10 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Specifically available for the LTE model, the custom firmware based on Google’s latest mobile OS can now be installed on the 2013 smartphone. The Korean tech giant has stopped providing official firmware support for Samsung Galaxy S4, primarily because it is an old phone already. But fortunately, those who are still holding on to their S4 units, particularly those bearing the model number GT-I9505, can now experience the newest Android offering. To verify if a Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE unit is suitable for an Android 7.0 Nougat update via crDroid custom ROM, one can check its model number by heading to the smartphone’s Settings menu and tapping About Device. The device’s specific model number should be listed on the screen together with other pertinent information. [Image by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Samsung] According to Team Android, the crDroid firmware based on Android 7.0 Nougat update comes with a number of features, mostly customizations, as well as tweaks to ensure a smooth and fast performance of the device. According to the list posted on the page, this custom firmware brings in features like Omni-Ambient Display, Blacklist, Swipe behavior, Superuser indicator, Force expanded notifications on expanded status bar, sound panel option on power menu, and a lot more. Those who wish to install Android 7.0 crDroid Nougat ROM should be fully aware that doing so is not recommended by Samsung. Using an unofficial firmware poses more risks and could brick or permanently damage the Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE unit, especially if inexperienced in custom ROM installation. However, if you are one of those adventurous Samsung Galaxy S4 users with a strong determination to push through with this update, knowing the pre-requisites when using a custom Android firmware will help a lot to ensure a successful process. Before flashing the crDroid ROM based on Android 7.0 Nougat OS, the Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE needs to be rooted first. Users also need to install a custom recovery like ClockWorkMod or TWRP to be able to flash the firmware. Moreover, the custom recovery tool is also necessary to create a backup of all the essential data and settings saved in the Samsung Galaxy smartphone. [Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] Another pre-requisite to get the Android 7.0 Nougat crDroid ROM update on the Samsung Galaxy S4 LTe is a fully-charged battery or at least having 80-85 percent battery. This is to make sure that it has enough juice pack so it will not suddenly power off in the middle of the process due to drained battery. Since updating through a custom ROM will entail the use of a computer, make sure the right Samsung Galaxy S4 drivers are installed in the PC for a smooth connection. USB Debugging mode should also be enabled on the device. Visit the post from Team Android (linked above) for the download links of necessary update files and the comprehensive guide on how to install Android 7.0 crDroid Nougat on Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE I9505. The official Android 7.0 Nougat update is only expected to be available in select Samsung Galaxy devices, particularly the recent flagships, which include Galaxy S7, S7 Edge as well as the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, and S6 Edge Plus. Moreover, HTC’s 2015 and 2016 flagships, the HTC 10 and M9 should also taste the Nougat flavor soon. LG’s V20 is regarded to be the first smartphone to arrive with Android 7.0 Nougat at launch. LG G5 could get the official update next month, according to Android Authority. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOuxpKXrruI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Sony is also hard at work to release this major OS update to a number of their devices. Sony’s official blog site shared which mobile devices are receiving the official Android 7.0 Nougat update. “We will make Android 7.0, Nougat available for: Xperia Z3+, Xperia Z4 Tablet, Xperia Z5, Xperia Z5 Compact, Xperia Z5 Premium, Xperia X, Xperia XA, Xperia XA Ultra, Xperia X Performance – and Xperia XZ & Xperia X Compact.” [Featured Image by Allison Joyce/Getty Images] Now Read This: Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 Plus, And Galaxy Note 8 Model Numbers Leak Share 29 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Venus Montalbo Tags: android, Android 7.0 Nougat, Android Nougat, firmware update Comments LATEST HEADLINES Veteran Deputy, 20 Years, Shot Down In ‘Direct Execution’ By This Man Could Hillary Clinton Still Become The Next President Of The United States?

All About Symbian News, reviews, information and apps for Symbian and Nokia. Home Flow News Reviews Features Media Apps & Games Forum PureView 'take two' and the Google Pixel Published by Steve Litchfield at 16:14 UTC, October 16th 2016 Although it's somewhat galling to read of imaging advancements in the smartphone world that aren't being made by Nokia engineers huddled in a chilly Finland, it's worth putting into context where smartphone imaging seems to be settling and where this fits into the existing spectrum of phone cameras, with specific reference to classic Nokias of the past. You see, powered by ever faster chipsets, 'computational photography' is indeed where imaging has ended up and, on the whole, for the benefit of all. The term 'computational photography' itself really came in with Nokia's 808 PureView, the idea being to take a huge sensor of tiny pixels and then combine their output into 'oversampled' average values for each lower resolution (5MP) 'super-pixel'. Here, the computation itself happened in a dedicated processing chip, since the main smartphone processor was nowhere near powerful enough on its own. The system worked rather wonderfully, with the various downsides being: the large sensor (1/1.2" in the 808's case) required a certain vertical depth for all the optics too, making the 808 'courageously' thick(!) the 2011 sensor was relatively old, i.e. there was no Back Side Illumination and no optical stabilisation, two tech essentials from camera phones that were to follow. the 808 ran Symbian, a fine OS for the 'noughties' but which was showing its age (and that of its ecosystem) by 2012, when the 808 finally went on sale. You couldn't fault the purity and quality of the 808's images, but the three caveats above meant that further progress needed to be made. The Lumia 1020, a year later, solved the three caveats, with: a slightly smaller (1/1.5" sensor), making the camera vertical depth manageable. BSI and OIS both onboard for handheld low light shots par excellence... it ran the fairly new (and Internet age) Windows Phone 8.1. Nothing's perfect though, and the 2012 Lumia 1020 had its own caveat, namely that the oversampling down from the higher resolution sensor had to be done in the main processor, since there was no companion dedicated image processor (the 808's had been 'in development for five years' and could only be used with that particular phone), with the result that it took a full four seconds to oversample and save a JPG photo. And this was in the 'foreground', meaning that the user had to sit around and wait. Plus Windows Phone 8.1 itself was starting to look a little long in the tooth (with large tiles, a design for lower resolution screens, and so on), not to mention a fairly lowly market share which mean that third party applications weren't always plentiful. But the idea of PureView 'computational photography' was good, that of using digital means to make more of physical light received. One approach would be to take the 1020's PureView sensor and system and throw much faster chipsets at it - this was something I'd dearly like to have seen - imagine a 1080p-screened, Snapdragon 820-powered Lumia 1020 successor! However, Nokia (and then Microsoft, taking on the existing in-production designs when it bought Nokia up) went a different way, with the Lumia 930, 1520 and then 950 and 950 XL all going for 'only' 20MP and a much reduced PureView oversampling ratio, down to 8MP for its output. The main benefit was speed, of course, with not only shot to shot times of less than a second but also the possibility of genuine multi-shot HDR (bracketing, something which we'd been seeing on the iPhone 4S first in the phone world), though with the digital processing (combining exposures) pushed into the background while the user got on with something else on the phone. Results were good though, on the whole, up with the Lumia 1020 (and 808 before it) as you'll see from my chart below, looking at different ways of achieving ultimate image quality from a phone-sized camera: The intriguing part of the chart is up at the top, where we have image quality that's supposed to be as good as that from the likes of the Nokia 808 and Lumia 950 (etc., watch this space for my feature comparisons!) but with more mundane specifications - the Google Pixel has a 'standard' sized 13MP sensor (1/2.3", apparently, so in the same ballpark as the Galaxy S7 and Lumia 950), no optical stabilisation and a relatively modest aperture at f/2.0. Yet at the launch presentation, this phone camera was rated higher than anything previously by DxOMark. Putting aside my own reservations of the DxOMark tests, it does seem as though the application of raw computing power (in typical Google fashion) to taking photos is yielding good results.  You see, rather than taking one huge shot and then (PureView) downsampling to reduce noise and improve purity (as on the 808/1020), computing power in a smartphone has now got so prodigious (in the Pixel's case, a Snapdragon 821 chipset with 4GB RAM) that it's possible to take several RAW photos (as needed) rather than one every time you press the shutter control, and do all manner of clever things to these huge 20MB un-encoded image files - auto-aligning, reducing noise, enhancing colours, white balancing, and more - spitting out and saving a 'purer' JPG-encoded image, all within one second (and in the background, so things are instantaneous for the user and the UI). Obviously, I need to test all this and a Pixel XL is about to arrive at 'All About Towers', but the whole concept is enticing. Rather than throwing optical hardware at imaging, Google is throwing processing power at the same problem and in the process doing away with the need for OIS (though I still hold a candle for Xenon flash!) I contend that you can think of Pixel-style 'computational photography' as the 2016 form of PureView. The idea's similar - using information from many sources to reduce random digital noise and improve dynamic range. Except that the sources in this case are from multiple frames (we don't know how many Google's proprietary HDR+ software demands, it probably varies according to conditions) rather than scattered parts of one shot from a higher resolution sensor. But the image data's real and it's RAW and is eminently suited for working with, away from the world of JPG compression artefacts. Whichever end of my curve/chart a smartphone camera works in, the end result should be similar in terms of image quality, i.e. what the user gets to see. Google calls the system in the Pixel range 'HDR+', but if Nokia had arrived at this point, in a parallel universe, it could equally well have been named 'PureView II'.  PS. There are benefits to being at the computing end of the curve rather than at the physics/specs end, as Microsoft managed to exploit in a limited fashion with its clever 'Dynamic exposure' mode, used in low light with moving objects on the Lumia 950, blending multiple exposures to try and keep the moving subject crisp. Something of the Pixel's power should be able to go further - it remains to be seen if Google's software engineers are as clever as the ex-Nokia team at Microsoft (were, many of them having moved on now), but at the launch event the idea of micro-bursts of photos capturing action was mooted, with the software identifying the 'perfect' moment for the final JPG. I'll be testing this too, in due course, don't worry. PPS. The article begs the question of how far HP can push the camera in the Elite X3 - this has so far produced very average photos, but with a Snapdragon 820 and 4GB of RAM there's no reason why similar processing couldn't help the X3 produce better, clearer images. Maybe not to the level of the Pixel here, but up closer to the current gold standard, that 808/1020/950 trio.

With plans starting at just $4 per month, Amazon's new streaming service sounds like an affordable alternative to the likes of Spotify. But is it really? Is Amazon Music Unlimited a good deal? 0 Share: Smart Home by Rick Broida October 13, 2016 11:15 AM PDT @cheapskateblog Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Amazon is coming for you, Apple Music. And Spotify. And Google Play Music. Yesterday, the e-commerce giant rolled out Amazon Music Unlimited, an ad-free streaming service that aims to compete with those established heavyweights. How? With lower prices. Sort of. Not to be confused with Prime Music, which affords Prime subscribers a fairly limited catalog, Music Unlimited offers "tens of millions" of songs, according to Amazon. (Its competitors get a little more specific, each claiming at least 30 million.) Let's just say it's Amazon's answer to Spotify. Beyond that, Music Unlimited offers tight integration with Amazon's Echo products. In fact, Echo owners can take advantage of special pricing. Let's take a look at the various subscription options and whether or not they're really a good deal. If you already have Amazon Prime You paid $99 for your Prime subscription, which works out to $8.25 per month. Sure, it affords lots of benefits beyond just Prime Music, but you still have to consider that as part of the equation. Existing Prime subscribers can add Music Unlimited for $7.99 per month -- or $79, if you pay annually. All the competing services charge $9.99 per month for a single-user subscription. So if you're paying for Prime already, another $7.99/month (or an effective $6.58 from an annual payment) is a decent deal -- though hardly a great one. If you already have an Amazon Echo Here's where it gets interesting. Echo owners can get Music Unlimited for just $3.99 per month. But -- and this is a big "but" -- that subscription will play your music only via Echo -- and only a single Echo at that. You don't get to listen on the web, and you don't get to use the mobile apps. Verdict: no, thanks. This might be a bigger deal if you had no other options for unlimited music via Echo. But you do: Spotify. And obviously that service doesn't limit you to a single device. Admittedly, $3.99 per month is the single cheapest streaming-music option out there, but remember, you still need an Echo, which isn't free. If you don't have Amazon anything "Civilians" can get Amazon Music Unlimited for $9.99 per month -- the same price you'd pay for Apple Music, Spotify or the like. So then the question is, how is Music Unlimited better than the competition? At first blush, it appears to be very similar: big catalog, curated playlists, personalized stations and so on. Perhaps the best argument for choosing it is if you think you'll purchase Prime and/or an Echo at some point down the road. But if you go with, say, Spotify from the start, you'll still enjoy Echo integration. If you have a family That $9.99 per month is for a single user. If you want a family plan -- even if you already subscribe to Prime -- will cost you $14.99 per month. That allows up to six users to share the service, on par with what you get from Apple, Google and Spotify family plans. However, Amazon also offers an annual payment option for Music Unlimited: $149, which works out to $12.42 per month. That would make it the least-expensive of the major music services. (I didn't find a discounted annual-payment option for any of the others.) But, as with the individual plan, the savings are pretty slim -- just a couple of bucks every month. I definitely don't see the value in Amazon's Echo-only plan, which is way too limiting, and unless you already have a subscription to Prime that you like for reasons other than music, the standard $9.99 rate is unexciting. If you do have that subscription, though, $7.99 per month is a solid single-user deal. And for families of six willing to prepay by the year, the $149 rate is definitely worth considering.

Facebook is now enabling users to show on their television monitors live and previously recorded personal videos posted on their news feeds, similar to the way Google and Apple allow streaming video clips using Google's Chromecast and Cast devices and Apple TV and AirPlay devices. Facebook users now can cast videos to a TV from a browser or their iOS smartphones or tablets as they already do to an Apple TV or any other AirPlay-enabled device, as well as the Chromecast and Google Cast-enabled devices. The new iOS app, announced Oct. 13, gives the social network a new dimension for advertising—a larger-scale venue for generating ad revenue. Users can expect to see pre-roll ads connected to their videos at some point. Facebook is expecting that the larger screens, higher resolution and increased viewing time for users and their viewers ostensibly to provide an attractive environment for advertisers. The Android version of the app is expected to become available soon, Facebook said. Whatever version someone uses, it's pretty easy to deploy: Simply find a video in the feed on your phone, tablet or desktop, touch the TV button in the top right, then select the device you want to use for the stream. In a few seconds the video will be playing on the TV. Facebook Live videos will include real-time reactions and comments that can be streamed across the screen. Users can also type in their reactions on the app while watching the video on their TV. User can scroll through the feed and continue using Facebook while the video streams. That puts Facebook on two screens for the user, a strategy advertisers certainly will favor. Facebook started testing streaming video to televisions from Android five months ago and iOS in August.         Chris Preimesberger is Editor of Features and Analysis at eWEEK. Twitter: @editingwhiz.

(Photo: cellanr/flickr/cc) Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, America’s most well-known brands and most prosperous firms, are demanding that states and localities provide them ever-larger economic development subsidies to support their data centers. Last year these five tech giants reported nearly $120 billion in pre-tax profits, and yet they told states and localities they needed financial help to build new data centers, structures essential to their business operations. Their efforts resulted in more than $2 billion in public support to build 11 new data centers. The facilities would create 1,174 long term jobs, amounting to an enormous per job subsidy of $1.95 million, according to Money Lost to the Cloud, a new report from Good Jobs First which I authored.  "Last year these five tech giants reported nearly $120 billion in pre-tax profits, and yet they told states and localities they needed financial help to build new data centers." Data centers have enormous footprints. Apple’s one in Maiden, NC has 500,000 feet of floor space, enough to fit nine football fields inside. And it is expensive – costing more than $1 billion, most of it for the endless racks of expensive servers and the powerful air conditioning required to keep the heat-spewing electronics cool. But despite this cost, the data center will employ fewer than 50 permanent workers, a subsidy of $6.4 million per employee, the most of any deal in our survey.  After Apple threatened to take the deal to neighboring Virginia, North Carolina officials changed tax rules that applied only to Apple to win the deal. Maiden, a city that struggled with high unemployment after the once-thriving furniture industry closed its last plant, agreed to partial property tax abatements. Economic development officials argued that drawing Apple to Maiden would create new jobs and diversify the local economy. But the high-tech computer maintenance jobs weren’t well suited for blue-collar workers whose talent was furniture construction. Though few locals wound up working for Apple, the company will nonetheless save $300 million in taxes over the next three decades.  Tech companies have grown skillful at dangling the prospect of jobs and playing one community off against one another. But the amount of tax subsidy is never what seals the deal in determining where a new data center is located. Data centers consume two percent of the nation’s supply of electricity, enough to power 6.4 million homes. Low energy costs – and for brand-conscious firms, energy derived from renewable sources – is the most important factor in locating new data centers. Positioning these vital centers far from the threats of hurricanes, earthquakes and floods and close to fiber infrastructure are other important considerations.  "Tech companies have grown skillful at dangling the prospect of jobs and playing one community off against one another." And yet, tech giants continue to push states to provide subsidies, lest they fall into another suitor’s arms. They do so in part, through an insistence on secrecy. Many projects are negotiated with code names that disguise corporate identities. Lawmakers are compelled to vote on deals without even knowing to whom they are giving tens or hundreds of millions of taxpayer-financed subsidy dollars. Offering seven-figure per jobs subsidies is a losing proposition for taxpayers and communities. Utah officials realized this when they backed out of a recent $260 million 20-year data center subsidy deal with Facebook. They understand there were other opportunities for the industrial land where the project would be located, opportunities that would result in more jobs for local residents. The State Board of Education worried that the loss of property tax revenue would deprive schools of necessary funding as they quashed the overly generous deal.  Facebook went to New Mexico, Utah’s competitor,  that offered  a package of tax exempt industrial revenue bonds and other tax subsidies to locate its data center in their already heavily subsidized Los Lunas project.  "In many communities, budget cuts have left class sizes expanding, longer wait lists for public housing, and growing lines at church food pantries. All the while there are no lines at the corporate subsidy window." It doesn’t have to be this way. States and cities don’t need to sacrifice good schools and high-quality public services for the prospect of a few good jobs. States that offer subsidies to data centers should establish reasonable per job caps of $50,000. They should mandate that subsidy deals should be negotiated in the light of day with no concealed corporate identities. And they should learn from Utah and know when to fold their hands and walk away from high-stakes bidding wars.  Data centers can be a good addition to local economies and a big factor in strengthening local fiscal conditions, but only if they pay their fair share of taxes. In many communities, budget cuts have left class sizes expanding, longer wait lists for public housing, and growing lines at church food pantries. All the while there are no lines at the corporate subsidy window. It is time to change that story.  This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License Kasia Tarczynska   Kasia Tarczynska is a research analyst at Good Jobs First and author of Money Lost to the Cloud: How Data Centers Benefit from State and Local Government Subsidies.  Share This Article Related Articles 'Resounding Win for Economic Equality': 4 States Vote to Boost Minimum Wage The Case Against Cynicism: A Dispatch from Colorado and Florida Memo to the Next President: Don’t Forget the Working Class Trade, Democracy, and the Politics of Backlash More in: U.S. , Technology, Labor, Workers Top Comments (Click to see more comments or to join the conversation) Sign Up for Newsletter   Today's Views Adam Johnson Polls Showed Sanders Had a Better Shot of Beating Trump–but Pundits Told You to Ignore Them Glenn Greenwald Trump Will Have Vast Powers.

By David Snelling David Snelling PUBLISHED: 10:08, Mon, Oct 17, 2016 | UPDATED: 10:08, Mon, Oct 17, 2016 GOOGLEGoogle Pixel will be released in the UK later this month Google unveiled its new Pixel smartphones earlier this month at a major event in the US. The Pixel, and larger Pixel XL, feature a 1080p FullHD AMOLED display made of super-tough Gorilla Glass 4, fast processor and quick charging battery. There's also a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and premium metal finish. Google is selling the Pixel directly from its Play Store with prices starting from £599 and it's also got an exclusive deal with EE and Carphone Warehouse. Google is dispatching pre-order devices on October 20th with EE and Carphone following a few days later. The internet giant has big plans for its first ever Pixel device and is hoping one killer feature can convince Apple iPhone fans to jump ship. GOOGLEGoogle's Pixel Phone will be releases on October 20th Tucked inside the packaging of the Pixel and Pixel XL is a unique adaptor which allows data to be transferred from the iPhone to this Android smartphone. When the device is first switched on, current Apple users will get the option to switch their emails, photos, contacts and even iMessages on to the Pixel. A cable is then used to instantly swap the content with the whole process taking minutes. Google has priced its new phone at a similar level to both the iPhone and Samsung's award-winning Galaxy S7 and is clearly targeting tech fans who want a premium phone in their pocket. Making the switch from Apple to Android has never been easy and Google is hoping this new feature will convince more to swap their opertating system. It's worth noting that although most content is switched, apps aren't part of the process and users will be force to download pay again for anything they've purchased on the Apple App Store. GOOGLEGoogle is including an adaptor to transfer data from its iPhone rival Express.co.uk attended the Made By Google hardware event and our first impressions of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are very, very good. Granted, the industrial design is a little bland – and would be difficult to pick-out of a line-up alongside the HTC 10, HTC One A9, and iPhone 6S. But it is solidly built and feels good in the hand. There’s no doubt that Android 7.1 is the star of the show here – with the eerily-clever Assistant meaning you’ll never have to Google a question every again. The one-tap access to a Google engineer from the Settings app should provide customers with ease of mind – as will the unlimited photo and video back-up. GOOGLEThe Pixel features a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner Redesigned Apple Store, Regent Street – First Look Thu, October 13, 2016 ENORMOUS video walls, a forest of trees, and free workshops from some of the world’s most talented professionals - welcome to the new Apple Store in London. Play slideshow EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS 1 of 21 The central London store is the first UK Apple Store to get the stunning new makeover But there’s a big stumbling block with the Google Pixel – the price. For an unknown quantity – remember, this is being marketed as Google’s first smartphone – the US search firm has matched the UK pricing of the iPhone.  That’s a bold move, and whether customers think the brilliant new additions to Android Nougat are worth that steep asking price remains to be seen.

 A funny expression inside Amazon shows why it's beating Google and Microsoft in the cloud Eugene Kim Oct. 16, 2016, 9:00 AM 37,561 facebook linkedin twitter email print AWS CEO Andy JassyAmazon Amazon has a huge lead against its competitors in the cloud market, with its Amazon Web Services on track to hit over $10 billion in revenue this year. AWS CEO Andy Jassy doesn't see that lead shrinking anytime soon because of one simple reason: experience. Amazon started offering public cloud-computing services nearly 10 years ago, way before any of its competitors did. That's given it a huge head start over its rivals, as AWS's revenue is estimated to be as much as over four times bigger than Microsoft Azure's, the second-largest provider. To remind his team of this, Jassy says they even have an internal slogan about it: "There’s no compression algorithm for experience." In other words, there's no shortcut to gaining experience. And the lessons you learn through those experiences aren't something you can simply buy off the shelf. "You just can’t learn some of the lessons that we’ve learned until you get to those different elbows of the curve of the scale," Jassy told Business Insider. Jassy also listed AWS's broad functionality and fast pace of innovation, as well as its vast partnership ecosystem as reasons for blowing away its competition. But he still shakes his head at the fact that it took so long for its rivals to realize the cloud market's massive potential. "One of the biggest surprises for me and for the team was just how long it took for other providers to build an offering. I don’t think any of us in our wildest dreams thought we’d have a 6-year head start," Jassy added. "There’s a substantial difference."

Industry leaders such as Google and Microsoft have regularly highlighted the need to bridge the growing “digital skills gap” to ensure more school leavers can win jobs in the booming tech sector. More than 84,000 people are employed in jobs such as software development, data, digital agency, telecoms, cloud and ICT services roles across the country and demand for digital skillsets will increase as the world becomes ever more connected. It’s with that in mind that Digital Xtra, a Scottish Government-backed funding programme for extracurricular computing projects, was launched in May. Successful bids were awarded a share of a £250,000 pot in August, ranging from programming classes taught at local libraries to a forensic investigations scheme. Now new applications are being invited for an additional £150,000 up for grabs. Eligible organisations can bid for grants from £1,500 to a maximum £25,000 per project to support computing science and digital skills extracurricular activities for 2016/17. Funding is intended to support enterprising organisations that give people aged 16 and under opportunities to learn computer science related digital skills and contribute to widening the provision of extracurricular activities across Scotland. Higher education minister Shirley-Anne Somerville  said: “The Scottish Government is determined to close the digital skills gap faced by all sectors across the economy. “We made clear our commitment to invest in the digital skills of our young people in the digital teaching and learning strategy we published last week. “This additional funding for Digital Xtra will give thousands more young people opportunities to strengthen their digital skills through their engagement in a range of innovative projects.” Career opportunities in the tech sector are significant with up to 11,000 job opportunities available in Scotland annually. It is anticipated that industry, employers and other funders will contribute in subsequent years, making this a sustainable approach. Applications will be assessed by an expert panel which includes representatives from across Scotland’s digital technologies industry, Scottish Government and education. Phil Worms, schools project lead at ScotlandIS, said: “The panel was impressed by the many innovative ideas and partnerships received in the first round so it is fantastic to be able to offer a further funding opportunity this year and make extracurricular computing activities available to even more young people. “Once again we are very keen to see collaborative applications involving different partners and projects that foster greater links between industry, young people and the wider community. Projects should also show how participants will be involved in digital making and what computer science related skills they will learn.” The Digital Xtra Fund welcomes applications from existing initiatives looking to expand their activities, as well as from innovative new projects and pilots that could be rolled out further in future. All applicants should clearly demonstrate potential for availability and sustainability, as well as showing how they will reach previously underrepresented groups. The deadline for submissions is noon on Friday, 4 November. Application details can be found on the Public Contracts Scotland website.

Boonen takes bronze. You can’t really fault Cavendish’s ride, given the odds he was up against it following the problems his team encountered early in the race, but Sagan was masterful and proved his class again, to take his second world title.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.32am EDT 09:32 Now Boasson Hagen comes to the front, ahead of his Norwegian team-mates, as Benatti peels away from the front too.

Naesen pulls away from the front, letting a straining, exerting Stuyven clear at the front, though he’s not pulling out altogether, and he carries on at the back of the pack. But Boonen effectively only has two team-mates left now.

It’s still a big ask. Meanwhile, Cavendish is on the wheel of Sagan, waiting, calculating. 12km remaining – and still we wait for a big attack or break. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.20am EDT 09:20 Cavendish and Blythe are still about halfway back in the front group, chatting away about their options, as they come to the bell. One lap to go, with Stuyven at the front, followed by Bennati and Naesen. This looks as if it’s going to be very close, and tense. UCI RWC Doha 2016 (@UCIDoha2016) 12 countries among the leading group: which one is going to win? #UCIDoha2016 pic.twitter.com/Rz7PhsPlOm October 16, 2016 Updated at 9.21am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.12am EDT 09:12 More on the crowds, or lack of. “There’s plenty of people here who want to watch the race,” writes Steven Cumming in Qatar, “the problem is the men’s race is on a Sunday which is the beginning of the working week in the Islamic world. UCI seem to be unable to budge the signature road event due to television rights one thinks. “Saying that I was at the women’s race yesterday, and there was a conspicuous absence of local support, only western expats or travelling fans. The only sport out here that will get any engagement is motorsport or football (soccer). Qatar 2022 world cup will of course be rammed with international fans predominantly from established rich world footballing nations. Even the dead rubber matches of little significance will get attendances as the authorities will likely draft the local labour population.” Meanwhile, the third group (the second chasing pack) are now flagged in en masse. 21km to go. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.07am EDT 09:07 Viviani drops back for a tactical chinwag with his race car – an interesting move so close to the finish – but he’s still in contention, on Sagan’s wheel. the flat course giving little away in terms of offering clues over fatigue or tactics. 25km to go, and still no attacks, though they’re still pedalling at a fair old pace. Updated at 9.09am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.01am EDT 09:01 Keukelaire has worked himself to the bone, but it’s now taking its toll and he slips to the back, his shift done. Stuyven of Belgium goes to the front, Blythe and Cavendish still in the midst of it all, crossing the line with two laps to go in 12th and 13th respectively. Remarkably, a number of the initial breakaway group from many hours ago, including Roth, Dougall and Berharne, are still with the leaders now. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.56am EDT 08:56 The absence of spectators at roadsides does lend a slightly strange atmosphere to everything, as a number of your emails have pointed out. Crossing sports, is this what we can expect at Qatar 2022? On the road, nothing much has changed for a while – are we heading for a straight-up sprint finish? We have 33km remaining. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.51am EDT 08:51 So, we have 37km remaining now, and challengers to the still-dominant Belgians include Viviani of Italy, Michael Matthews of Australia, Boasson Hagen and Kristoff of Norway, Slovakia’s Sagan and of course Cavendish. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.46am EDT 08:46 Degenkolb calls it a day! He looks angry and dejected, as has been blatantly obvious for the past hour. Kittel has jacked it in too. The chasing group is now three minutes behind, and out of it. Updated at 8.48am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.36am EDT 08:36 Naesen just pulls off the front to let Keukelaire have another turn up the front. Belgium will be disappointed if they can’t manage a victory here, but while Cavendish is among them, he cannot be discounted. Just under 50km to go. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.24am EDT 08:24 The lead group have been strung out for pretty much the entirety of the 100km or so they’ve been at the head of the race. It’s been intense – will tiredness take its toll? Angry John Degenkolb continues to have a go at the front of the first chasing pack, but they’re still just under two minutes behind. Updated at 8.30am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.21am EDT 08:21 So, with the gap at two minutes plus from the chasing group, where and when are the breakaways going to come from the leading group? Cavendish and Sagan both have to calculate how to deal with the team groups around them – from the strongly represented Belgium, Italy and Norway – and might even go against type and work together, as the less protected contenders. There are now four laps to go. Naesen of Belgium remains at the very front. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.12am EDT 08:12 Keukelaire, who’s ridden excellently, comes to the front for the moment as the Belgian masterclass continues. Cavendish and Sagan remain tight next to each other. Some tomfoolery group in the chasing back as Degenkolb storms across the line between friendly ‘bantz’ and outright needle and squirts a bottle of water at the Belgian Debuscchere behind him. Fraught rush-hour-style road-rage stuff, this, and an official drives over to have a word. blogdroed OMB (@blogdroed) John Degenkolb has lost it! #UCIDoha2016 - the most exciting thing that’s happened in this race October 16, 2016 Updated at 8.15am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.09am EDT 08:09 The German riders Degenkolb and Griepel are raging against the dying of the light back in the chasing group – they’re more than two minutes behind now and don’t look like making up the ground they need, but they haven’t given up. Yet. 70km to go. Updated at 8.15am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.03am EDT 08:03 With five laps to go there are three Belgians and three Italians at the very front (Naesen leading), with Boasson Hagen next, and Boonen and Cavendish just sitting back, poised. No major moves yet until the front-runners can be sure the chasing group’s out of the game. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.56am EDT 07:56 Degankolb tries another break from the chasing group, which is two minutes behind now, but the German can’t force the issue due to the inevitable Belgian pressure. Blythe is safely back in the leading group, and his team-mate Cavendish is still very much in there, biding his time for the finish. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.51am EDT 07:51 Bennati is back at the front of the lead group, with Cavendish about two thirds of the way down it. A bit of bother for his team-mate Blythe though – he has to stop to fix a puncture. Greipel meanwhile tries to lead another attack from the chasing group, but the Belgians are having none of it and stay with him. In the second group Scott Thwaites takes a tumble but is back on his bike soon enough. Updated at 7.52am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.44am EDT 07:44 Degankolb tries to lead one last break from the chasing pack, but the Belgians have been excellent among this group too and stay on his tail. Up at the front, Boonen is just sitting back as his muckers do the work at the very front but looks composed. Naesen is first over the line at the end of the first lap. And the gap is now 1:40 between the front and the chase group, who might just be effectively knocking it all on the head shortly. Updated at 7.44am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.37am EDT 07:37 Way back down the field, the riders in the fourth chasing group are flagged off the course. It’s a measure of how punishing this race has been that it’s a sizeable group indeed. Rowe, Thomas and Cummings are among them – a desperately disappointing end for those GB riders. At the front, the gap between the Belgium-dominated leading group and the main chasing one is stretched to 1:30. Though Viviani of Italy is at the very front at present. Gary Naylor (@garynaylor999) @tomdaviesE17 Cav isn't too disadvantaged - without a team, he might get left alone.

Why not have an attack’ and does so, but there’s little that’s concerted going on among that pack. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.31am EDT 07:31 The Belgians and the Italians appear to have conferred on tactics, with Bennati slipping back into a domestique role, to ensure pressure is maintained on the chasing group, just to keep those fancied riders in the chasing group at arm’s length. 100km to go! Updated at 7.31am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.27am EDT 07:27 Bennati of Italy is first over the line at Intermediate 1, followed by Blythe, as they enter the circuit with seven laps to go. Haller attacks to move ahead of the chasing group, in which Britain’s Thwaites and Swift are hanging on in there. Caleb Ewan of Australia pulls out at the first crossing of that finish line. Updated at 7.28am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.20am EDT 07:20 Peter Sagan makes a mistake – but only in failing to grab some refreshment; he’s still very much in the mix, race-wise, as is Cavendish, while the Norwegian pair Boasson Hagen and Kristoff are riding well too. It’s been a rotten race for Germany mind, with no riders in the front group, and Greipel and Kittel marooned in the chasing pack. The Belgians are working well to shut down and contain Greipel at the head of that group too. Updated at 7.20am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.16am EDT 07:16 The Belgians lead a train at the front, with no real sign of the gap closing to the chasing pack – it’s still just over a minute. Now they’re on the seven-lap circuit Belgium can boss things from here, as they prove by just stepping up the pace a little to keep up that gap.

The leading group have an advantage of a minute and eight seconds over the next one. There’s 123km to go. Boonen, Sagan and Cavendish in contention – Belgium in general in the box seat. Of the early breakaway group, the South African Dougall remains impressively up among the front-riders Updated at 7.04am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.53am EDT 06:53 Cavendish is riding well in the circumstances, it must be said, unfazed by the loss of team-mates (though Blythe is sticking to his task) and the dominance of the Belgians, who with six riders in the leading group continue to hold all the aces. A less than chuffed Kittel leads the second group, but it’ll be tough to make that ground now. Updated at 6.54am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.46am EDT 06:46 The chasing group, exposed and lacking team-assistance, look poorly placed to reel in the front runners now, especially against an unforgiving wind. Which means the riders in that early breakaway group, staying with the leaders, are still nicely positioned. For the British, Cavendish and Blythe are still on their own and likely to remain so. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.42am EDT 06:42 The early breakaway group are caught, parting as Boonen leads the Belgian train right through the middle of them, with 144km to go. Sagan and Cavendish are still among the front group, as is Boasson-Hagen of Norway. It’s all gone a bit pear-shaped for Ireland’s Sam Bennett, who was riding strongly earlier but has now dropped right back, possibly suffering from a hand injury.

Cavendish is still among them in the first chasing group, but shorn of all team-mates bar Rowe (unless the British riders in the second group can make serious ground), he faces a big uphill task now, though not literally, in the punishing, flat windswept desert. Scores on the doors now: 21 seconds from the leaders to group 1, who are a minute or so ahead of the second group.

Ramirez of Colombia and Lagkuti of Ukraine are the very front two in the race, but it’s almost game over for that first breakaway group, whose lead on the first group is now whittled down to under a minutes and a half. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.27am EDT 06:27 Meanwhile Andre Greipel, quiet thus far, moves to the front of the second group in the peloton, but he’s some way off making his mark. The second group sits 40 seconds or so behind the first, who are closing on the leading group, which now has a lead of only two and a half minutes. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.25am EDT 06:25 It’s all got very chaotic, including for the race organisers’ computer system, which is glitch-ridden and confusing the TV commentary team. There are only 25-30 riders in this race now, with Blythe providing the assistance to Cavendish, but the Belgians remain compact and in control, while almost everyone else looks stressed and ragged. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.23am EDT 06:23 Cavendish and Blythe are the only British riders together in that first group, in which Tom Boonen and Peter Sagan are now nicely placed. It’s going to be very tough for Cavendish now. More crash woe for Colombia, as Ramirez in the leading group skids off onto his backside as his front wheel appears to be lifted off the ground, suggesting the wind is getting up once more. 159km to go. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.19am EDT 06:19 There are some actual spectators now – well, a couple of people with Spanish flags. In front of them they see a nasty little crash – the Australian Durbridge colliding with Mezgec of Slovenia and Gaviria of Colombia at the back of the second group in the peloton. The Belgian still in command at the front of the first group in the peloton, which is now under four minutes from the leaders.

The Belgians are pushing hard now at the head of the peloton, and it’s disrupted Britain’s strategy – Geraint Thomas and Luke Rowe have dropped right back, which will concern Cavendish. Sam Bennett, the Belgian born Irish rider, is battling gamely among the Belgians at the front of the peloton. Peter Sagan’s well in contention too – there’s 167km to go, and under five minutes separate the leading group from the rest. There are now two very distinct groups in the peloton. Updated at 6.15am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.07am EDT 06:07 We’re heading south again now, the road narrower, a tad more uneven looking, and taking its toll. The Netherlands’ Tom Dumoulin’s had to retreat for technical assistance, a possible flat tyre. The peloton is now properly fragmented and strung out, the British and Belgian riders still pushing strongly at its head. Caleb Ewan of Australia is struggling now, and has dropped right back. And there’s been a nasty little crash involving the American Marcotte, who’s one of three riders unseated. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.03am EDT 06:03 The Belgian riders make a drive for the front of the peloton, but Britain’s Luke Rowe makes it to the very front of the pack as they make their first turn, Cavendish just behind him. The leading group are being reined in now, the gap down to 6:50. The first splits are beginning to emerge in the peloton, as the British team pile on the pressure. This is impressive stuff. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.59am EDT 05:59 These are some of the straightest and flattest and frankly dullest roads you’ll see, but they’ll be turning soon, and the peleton has closed on the leading group to under eight minutes, with Corella of Mexico dropping back from it. The British team still look nicely placed at the front of the peloton. Updated at 6.00am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.51am EDT 05:51 A swirling sandstorm just misses the front of the peloton, in which the Dutch move up towards the front. The gap to the leading group is now just under nine minutes behind the leading group, but no significant movements as yet. 185km to go. Updated at 5.52am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.43am EDT 05:43 A little bit of jostling and jockeying in the peloton as they approach the turn back towards Doha, and the wind begins to pick up. Australia’s Renshaw and Ewan drop to the back for ice pack and cooling assistance before working their way wide on the left back into a congested pack. The absence of crowds or landmarks along the way lends a slightly odd atmosphere to proceedings. 190km to go. Updated at 5.44am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.28am EDT 05:28 Mid-amble Morning everyone. Welcome to live coverage of the men’s world road race. Essential technical maintenance work meant Guardian Towers had to turn the internet off and turn it on again overnight, which means you join us mid-race, but with still just under 200km or so to go in the searing heat in Qatar. So what’s happening? The early breakaway was led by Ramirez of Colombia, Morocco’s Anass Ait el Abdia, Sergiy Lagkuti of Ukraine, Ryan Roth of Canada, Eritrea’s Natnael Berhane, Nick Dougall of South Africa, and the Mexican Rene Corella. The lead group is about 10 minutes ahead of the peloton, at the head of which Mark Cavendish is being assiduously looked after by Steve Cummings, and his GB team-mates. It looks mercilessly scorching out there, as they head towards the turn. I feel parched and weary just watching it, and I’m in rainy London.

Dela Cruz, UniversityHerald Reporter Google Pixel Phone Review: 3 Things Why Nexus Phones are Way Better than Pixel Phones According to Developers [VIDEO] SAN FRANCISCO, CA - OCTOBER 04: Members of the media examine Google's Pixel phone during an event to introduce Google hardware products on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco, California. Google unveils new products including the Google Pixel Phone making a jump into the mobile device market. (Photo : Ramin Talaie/Getty Images) The reported demise of Nexus phones have sparked disappointment to some developers by saying that the lineup is better than the newly launched Pixel phones. In a developer's perspective, is there really a wide gap between Nexus and Pixel phones?   Advertisement Though Google has not confirmed about the discontinuation of Nexus brand, they have made an announcement during the Oct. 4 event that there will be no more Nexus smartphones production in the future. For this reason, fans, especially the developers, have become disappointed over the news. The following reasons will let you know why Nexus are highly appreciated by developers compared to the newly launched Google Pixel phones: Open-Source Nature One of the unique characteristics found in Nexus lineup is the smartphones' open-source nature. This characteristic refers to the original code of the software that can be modified freely. According to Android Headlines, because of the openness of Nexus, the phones can be completely unlocked. Unlockable Boot Loader Nexus phones come with unlockable boot loader that can be easily rooted. Through the boot loader, Nexus phones are able to open their doors to custom ROMs such as CyanogenMod and custom recovery software. For this reason, Nexus phones are open to modification through the use of custom ROMs.    First in Line for Updates Nexus phones are always first in in when receiving Android monthly updates and security patches. For this reason, Nexus phones will never blink even if it's loaded. Also, the phone runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow dubbed as the purest form of Android. Nexus 6P Sales Increase Advertisement Just when everybody thought that Google Pixel phones' sales will increase after Samsung Galaxy Note 7 global recall, Forbes reported that the biggest beneficiary is the Nexus 6P. Due to the model's display feature, a 5.7-inch AMOLED screen with 64GB storage capacity, consumers are likely to see Nexus 6P as the best alternative for the Note 7.     Tags google pixel phone release date, google pixel phone specs, google pixel phone review, google pixel phone price, google pixel phone case, google pixel phone verizon, google pixel phone reddit © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

Which part was inappropriate, you may ask -- the sex talk? No. But, the ridiculous need to name-drop when discussing his sex life? Well, that was a total turnoff. In case you missed it, the former Jonas Brothers bandmate (turned DNCE member) opened up during his AMA -- or, "Ask Me Anything" -- and spilled some telling details about losing his virginity to an ex-girlfriend named Ashley. During the open Q&A to Reddit users, when asked about who he'd lost his virginity to, Jonas only gave a first name -- but he reminded us that we could "just Google it." Are we serious here? How old are we, Joe? For those in the pop culture know, it was easy to remember that Joe Jonas had once famously dated Twilight's Ashley Greene -- and for those who heeded Joe's advice, well, they were able to simple Google it. Tacky? Definitely. Immature? Of course. But the most offensive part was that he tried to play coy or as if he somehow wasn't spilling all the damn tea -- but instead just insulted her and our intelligence.  More from CafeMom: 16 Celebrity Couples You Won't Believe Dated (PHOTOS) He even went on to tell a bit of the story about how things went down as he searched for a condom -- which, as I stated before, would've been just fine had he not forfeited Greene's right to privacy and completely thrown her under the bus by revealing her name.   Greene handled it with every bit of tact that Joe clearly lacked -- presumably taking a small jab at the interview with an Instagram pic that read "class is timeless." But we can't help but wonder what the public's reaction might be like if the tables were turned.  A photo posted by Ashley Greene (@ashleygreene) on Oct 12, 2016 at 8:18am PDT Had the Twilight actress been the one to name-drop Jonas -- especially in that shady manner -- the public wouldn't be eating up the gossip and simply calling the interview candid and TMI. They'd likely react by saying that she name-dropped for the attention or that she was desperate or even pathetic.  More from CafeMom: 28 Celeb Couples We'd Hate to See Call It Quits (Like, for Real) Perhaps I'm not giving society enough credit, but I seriously doubt it. We live in a world where sex talk is only charming and honest if you're a male -- and women still fight to be able to discuss sex in the same manner that men are allowed. So while some people and even some media outlets may have called him out for oversharing, I imagine that Greene would definitely catch it significantly more if she has revealed "Joe" as her first. But, hey, what do I know? Except this: A guy -- or a girl -- who kisses and tells is no good.    Image via Ahmad & Saleem Elatab / Splash News  Read More celebs, dating, sex, twilight Share this Story Share Tweet Pin 1 comments Related Articles TV 17 Literal Girl Bosses From TV Shows That Prove Women Rule TV Your 'Gilmore Girls' Refresher Course -- as Told in 16 Classic GIFs Get the latest from The Stir directly to your inbox Subscribe Please enter a valid email address.

The under sea Internet cable will stretch a whopping 12,800 kilometers (8,000 miles) and will be the first of its kind direct connection between the two locations and the fastest intercontinental undersea cable with one of the lowest latencies. The cable is expected to be ready in mid 2018 according to the two companies. Details revealed by the tech giants indicate that once operational, the connection will be able to handle a whopping 120 terabytes of data per second and if we put it in understandable worldly terms, the data amounts to somewhere around 80 million HD video conference calls simultaneously between Los Angeles and Hong Kong. Facebook points out that almost all trans-pacific Internet cables run from US to Japan and this makes this particular cable from LA to Hong Kong unique. The PLCN will help more and more people to connect directly from Asia to the US and this new route will enable technology companies to have more diversity and resiliency in the Pacific. Increased proliferation of Internet into the life of people around the world has put an unprecedented demand on the data cables connecting continents and countries and this calls for rapid expansion of the infrastructure capabilities to quickly and efficiently move data. Google has already invested in five prior such cables with the PLCN being the sixth submarine cable. Google claims to have the “largest network backbone of any public cloud provider.” Microsoft and Facebook early this year teamed together to lay a high-speed Internet cable across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The subsea “MAREA” cable was expected to be completed by late 2017, with the aim of meeting growing demand by the tech companies’ customers for fast, reliable data connections. MAREA was expected to have a capacity of some 160 terabytes per second of data, according to the companies. The 6,600 kilometer cable system will also be the first connecting the United States and southern Europe, running from Northern Virginia to Bilbao, Spain, Microsoft and Facebook said.

If you’re like me, it’s at least two or three times per day. But what if you could just ask a question aloud, and in an instant have a response? Enter Amazon Echo, an intuitive device designed around your voice that’s always on and can answer just about any question you can throw at it. Users can simply ask for information, to have music played, have the news read, the weather read, and so much more. Users can set an alarm, take notes, or add to their grocery list just by telling Alexa to do so. The Amazon Echo begins working as soon as it hears someone say the wake word, “Alexa.” For example, “Alexa, how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon?” And, the device will respond immediately with the correct response. The Echo sports an array of seven microphones so that you can be heard from any direction. This wireless speaker also has enhanced noise cancellation, so it can even hear you ask a question while it’s playing music. The device runs off of cloud technology, running on Amazon Web Services so it learns and adds more functionality over time. The more you use Echo, the more it learns about you and adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary and preferences. Of course, it wouldn’t be 2014 if the Echo didn’t come with its own app, the Amazon Echo app, which is free on Fire OS and Android. Strangely, the Amazon Echo is only available for purchase through invite — presumably until they are able to make more units to keep up with the demand. It will cost $199, or $99 for Amazon Prime members. You can sign up to purchase the Amazon Echo here. Undoubtedly, this is going to become THE wireless speaker to buy as a gift for someone this Christmas. As it’s the best wireless speaker from Amazon.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Oct 15, 2016 at 6:00PM Image source: The Motley Fool. According to the recently released 2016 Best Global Brands Ranking from Interbrand, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable brand in the world, with an estimated market value of $178 billion. These kinds of rankings and value estimates are always a matter of discussion, but it's hard to argue the fact that Apple is world-class brand, and this has important implications for investors in the company.  The value of a brand Investing in companies with strong brand value can be a powerful strategy for superior returns over the long term. When a company has a differentiated brand, this means customers are willing to buy that company's products over products from the competition offering a similar price and quality. This protects the business from competitive pressure, and it can also mean above-average pricing power, which has a positive effect on the company's profit margins. Interbrand implements a holistic approach that includes both quantitative financial data and subjective considerations for valuing a brand. Financial analysis incorporates variables such as after-tax operating profits, minus a charge for the capital used to generate the brand's revenue and margins. Interbrand also includes other aspects such as the portion of the purchase decision attributable to the brand, as opposed to factors like price and product features. When it comes to measuring brand strength, the consulting firm also evaluates the brand's ability to to create loyalty and sustained demand in the future.  On the other hand, the Forbes Brand Ranking puts more weight on financial considerations than Interbrand. According to Forbes: "We measure the value of a brand by looking at the financials instead of fuzzy consumer surveys. The most valuable brands are ones that generate significant earnings in industries where branding plays a major role." Forbes also considers Apple the most valuable brand in the world, with a calculated value of $154 billion. Interestingly, both Interbrand and Forbes put competitor Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) brand in the second position among global brands. Interbrand estimates that the Google brand is worth $133 billion, while Forbes has a more conservative valuation of $82.5 billion for Google. Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) is another top player in the industry, even if the company is facing a massive blow after the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 disaster, which will probably take a considerable toll on Samsung's brand value. Interband puts Samsung in the seventh global position, with an estimated value of $51.8 billion. When it comes to the Forbes Brand Ranking, Samsung is ranked in the 11th place, with a brand value calculated at $36.1 billion.  How brand value benefits investors in Apple The consumer electronics industry is notoriously challenging and competitive, and most companies in the sector operate with razor-thin profit margins. Global smartphone demand is slowing down thanks to market saturation across the world, and research firm IDC has recently cut its growth forecast for the industry to an anemic increase of 1.6% in shipments during 2016. In this context, many smartphone manufacturers are aggressively cutting prices to protect market share, which is hurting profit margins across the board.   However, you wouldn't have guessed that by looking at Apple. Even if the company is facing declining revenue, the business still generates enormous profitability for investors during challenging times. According to data from Morningstar, Apple produced an operating profit margin around 28.5% of revenue during the 12-month period ended in June of 2016. This is more than double the 12.8% operating margin produced by Samsung in the same period, and the profitability gap will probably increase over the coming months because of the problems Samsung is facing with the Galaxy Note 7.   Based on data from financial services company Cannacord Genuity, Apple captured a staggering 75% of all operating profits in the smartphone industry during the second quarter of 2016. This is in spite of the fact that the company accounted for a relatively small 11.7 % smartphone unit sales during the period. Because Apple launched the new iPhone 7 in September, and because Samsung is suffering a major setback, chances are good that Apple will grab an even larger share of profits in the industry. It's hard to objectively calculate how much a brand like Apple is worth, so investors need to take these estimations with a grain of salt. However, the main point to consider is that brand value is a crucial return driver for investors in Apple stock.

Some worry about privacy. Others are happy to give away their most intimate details in return for accessing online services. This is not a judgement. It’s an observation. Snooping as a business model Privacy, or rather snooping on people, is the main business model for many social media sites. It also drives Google and, by extension, is central to Android smart phones. You see how this works when you search for a term online or visit an online store. Often online advertisements for related products can dog you for days. Or sometimes the ads feature unrelated products from sellers who misread your intentions. In effect, Google gives you a phone operating system, office software, mail or a powerful online search engine in return for being able to watch you. It’s not just Google. Facebook has a similar business model. Companies like Twitter, Dropbox, Disqus and Reddit track your activity even when you are not on their sites. Many people are happy with this kind of contract. Faustian Others see it as a Faustian pact. Some of those who feel comfortable with having their data gathered may feel less secure if they knew how much data is being gathered. And it may shock those of us who think we are careful not to give much away to learn just how much personal information is stored in big data silos. Writing at The Overspill, Charles Arthur found he was logged into 11 services. As Arthur notes, that’s despite trying to avoid Google and using a blocker to stay private. You can find your own social media fingerprint. The site tells you how many online properties are tracking your every move. Going to the dark side Even if you are happy to have huge companies pry into your personal business, there is something darker you need to know about. Tracking isn't that secure. It’s possible for other snoopers to use the various trackers to watch you. They may have more worrying intentions than selling your profile to advertisers. If crooks can get this data, they may figure out if, say, you are not at home. That’s handy information for burglars. This kind of personal data is also powerful ammunition for a phishing attack. There's no need to panic, but take a moment to check what information you are giving away and ask yourself if you always get enough in return. It's your call, but take care to make an informed decision.

Raymond Ronamai   October 15, 2016 21:06 IST 3 Shares 3 Shares Samsung Galaxy A7Samsung Samsung not only took longer than expected to roll out Android Marshmallow update to its flagship devices, but also missed out some of its popular mid-range handsets. The company is yet to seed the 2015 firmware to some of its devices, and this has cast doubt on whether Google's new operating system Android 7.0 Nougat update will come to handsets like Galaxy A5, Galaxy A7, Galaxy A9, Galaxy J5, Galaxy C5, Galaxy C7 and others. Android 7.0 Nougat has already been released to Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and Android One.

Open source news for your reading pleasure. October 2-15, 2016 Russia and the Netherlands propose moves to open source For years now, governments throughout Europe have been enthusiastically adopting open source software. Their main reasons for doing so have been to lower costs and to be able to modify the software to suit their needs. Governments in Russia and the Netherlands are following that trend, but for divergent reasons. The Russian Duma announced earlier this month that it's drafting a law to give preference to open source over proprietary software. Specifically, "the law will require local agencies to give preference to open source software and justify any purchases of proprietary software." In an interview with Bloomberg News, Duma official Andrey Chernogorov cites security as a major driver behind this shift. Much of the government's IT infrastructure is based on proprietary, foreign-made platforms, and Chernogorov said that the Russian government is "seeking to close this loophole for state purchases, as it causes security risks." In the Netherlands, the lower house of Parliament is tabling a law that will make open standards mandatory. Astrid Oosenbrug, the member of Parliament who proposed the law, said "switching to open standards will increase interoperability and lower costs for citizens and companies." The proposal also states that the government should promote open source software. Google releases more open source software In the past year or so, several of the largest tech companies have been releasing a lot of open source software. That includes Google. Over the last couple of weeks, the tech giant has made three very different projects available as open source. First up, a photo recognition algorithm nicknamed Show and Tell that's based on Google's TensorFlow machine learning library. The algorithm can "recognize objects in photos with up to 93.9 percent accuracy, and help to automate smart photo captioning." The code is available on GitHub. Next, the Cartographer, is library that takes data from sensors and builds a map of the area the sensor is scanning. Cartographer, according to Google, can be an "essential component of autonomous platforms such as self-driving cars, automated forklifts in warehouses, robotic vacuum cleaners, and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)." You can check out the code for Cartographer on GitHub. Finally, there's Noto. It's a set of fonts that "consists of 110,000 characters and 110 writing systems" covering 800 languages. Those languages include little-used Canadian aboriginal languages, as well as "an alphabet from the fourth century that is found mostly on monuments and manuscripts." Mozilla funds promising open source projects While Mozilla is best known for the Firefox web browser, the organization also backs other open source projects through the Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) program. In the last few months, "MOSS awarded more than $300,000 to four projects which it either already supported, or which were aligned with the organization's mission." Those projects are Redash (a data visualization tool), Review Board (a web-based code review tool), Kea (a replacement for the protocol to configure network nodes), and Speech Rule Engine (a library for translating mathematical markup to speech for the visually impaired). Cornell's student scheduling software goes open Two years ago, recent Cornell University graduate Jingsi Zhu used the web development skills he picked up interning at Google and Facebook to create a student scheduling application. The result was CoursePad.me, which not only became popular with Cornell's students but also recently went open source. Zhu's main reason for making CoursePad.me open source was lack of time. With his post-graduation job, he "realized that he would need to devote more time to his work than to CoursePad." He's hoping that "developers will use his code to continue work on CoursePad both off and on campus, potentially making it available to any university," according to the Cornell Sun. If you're interested in doing that, you can grab the code from Zhu's GitHub repository.

Online Learning Update Online Learning News and Research ~ Ray Schroeder, editor ~ University of Illinois at Springfield « MOOC-Based Credential Options Expand in Online Education Brain-inspired device to power artificial systems » Here’s the best case that software is about to disrupt education by Timothy B. Lee, Vox Andreessen: Udacity is growing very fast and doing very well, and has locked in on this concept of nanodegrees…. The big new course they have teaches how to design and code and build a self-driving car. Think about that. In 2005, a self-driving car was a DARPA grand challenge. In 2010 it was 1,500 people at Google doing this dark science thing that nobody understood from the outside. Now you can literally sign up on Udacity and take an online course to learn how to build a self-driving car and go work for Google or Uber or Tesla or any of these other companies. I think it’s pretty significant, number one that that’s happening, in terms of how fast it’s happening. But it’s also significant that it’s happening on Udacity and not at Harvard, or for that matter your local community college. Udacity is a software company. It has software-scale economics. As they refine their model, their ability to scale is present in the model. They’re not there yet, but they are scaling quite quickly now. http://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/10/6/13092272/marc-andreessen-education-disruption Share on Facebook This entry was posted on Sunday, October 16th, 2016 at 12:04 am and is filed under Online Learning News.

Ruth Tierney meets four famous cooks you’ve probably never heard of From left: the cupcake queen Jemma Wilson, the bloke next door Barry Lewis and the family-friendly sisters Claire and Lucy McDonald So you want to rustle up truffle-infused mac ’n’ cheese but you need a little expert know-how. Where do you turn? If you’re 34-plus, chances are your go-to guide will be a dog-eared cookbook or a recipe website put together by a trusted television chef.  But if you’re under 34, the so-called ‘millennials’ demographic, it’s a different story. Your source of advice is less expert chef, more self-made maverick. A person who looks like you and lives like you; whose food is real rather than artfully styled; whose kitchen and friends are their own rather than props.  In other words, a YouTuber who posts cookery videos online. For here lies the future of food, with video blogging stars (or vloggers) pulling in millions of hits – not to mention six-figure sponsorship deals every time they bake a cake or poach an egg. Most of these vloggers are amateur cooks, armed with little more than a camcorder, a spatula and an affable manner. Yet the kind of success they are enjoying is incredible, with many bagging book deals and others able to give up the day job. You know a trend is catching on when Jamie Oliver sits up and takes notice. Food Tube, a YouTube channel of vlogs by Jamie and the latest bright young foodies, has had a whopping 250 million views – figures television programmes can only dream of.  More surprising still is that relative unknowns are able to command viewing figures on a par with Jamie’s – SortedFood, for example, is a YouTube channel set up by four ordinary British blokes whose fun recipe videos (such as bubble tea and cronuts) have been watched 221 million times. We spoke to the stars of three super-successful YouTube shows about the rise and rise of video how-tos.   The Family-Friendly Sisters Claire (left) and Lucy McDonald, the sisters behind Crumbs Who Claire and Lucy McDonald, aged 43 and 41, sisters from London, who created Crumbs. Viewing figures More than 36,000 subscribers and more than 2.5 million views. USP Family-friendly food for busy parents. ‘Our channel has a different dynamic because there are two of us, we’re sisters and we’re letting people into our world to watch us bicker,’ says Claire. Most popular recipe Their 5-Min Cake in a Cup, which you bake in the microwave, has had nearly 203,000 views. Also popular is Broccoli Pasta. ‘We’ve had people come up to us in the street to thank us for that recipe,’ says Claire. How it happened ‘After having my second child Bruno, now six, I went from cooking once a day to four times a day, and found most recipes were so complicated they were beyond me,’ says Claire. ‘I needed something with a maximum of five ingredients, three of which were already in the cupboard. Nothing out there spoke to me. I’m a writer and was talking to Lucy, a broadcast journalist, about doing a cookery blog for parents when she said, “Can I do it with you?” That was five years ago and before long we had two book deals, despite having no cookery training.’ ‘In 2011 we were approached by a production company called Little Dot Studios, which had seen our blog and wanted to make videos of us cooking for YouTube,’ says Lucy. ‘You have to be good to stand out online and we thought pairing up with a professional company would be the best way to go. Plus we both have full-time jobs, so filming and editing it ourselves would be too time consuming.’ The filming process  ‘We film in our kitchens with two cameramen – one for us, one for the food,’ says Lucy. ‘Our children (we have four between us) wander in and out, and my dog Polly usually makes an appearance. Although we are filmed by a production company, we have complete control of content and are never scripted. We don’t have hair or make-up, or even time to consider outfits – usually my top has porridge down the front. We have different styles of cooking so take turns making things. I’m far more trashy and novelty, while Claire is earthy and lentil-y.’ One of my biggest disasters is one of our most popular videos. Improvisation goes down well ‘Lucy is a natural in front of the camera, but for me it was really weird at first,’ adds Claire. ‘I rambled or lost the power of speech completely. It took about three months to get used to it, but having Lucy next to me helped. It has transformed our relationship – we’re much closer now.’ Hours spent ‘In terms of hours, we film at least one full day a week. In addition to that, we practise all the recipes beforehand and have to shop for ingredients and update our social media followers. A lot of it is done after 9pm when the kids are in bed,’ says Claire. Who watches it ‘Mainly women in the US and UK in the 25-44 age group, which is pretty old in the YouTube world. That’s the demographic with money, so advertisers are interested in it,’ says Claire. Worst on-camera mistake ‘One of my biggest disasters, How to Make a Fairy Castle Cake, has become one of our most popular videos [with more than 36,000 views],’ explains Lucy. ‘When I took it out of the oven, it had completely sunk in the middle, so I used shop-bought madeira cake to patch it up, then iced over the top. Improvisation goes down well.’ Proudest YouTube moment ‘Hitting 30,000 subscribers last October was a big deal for us. It’s hard work attracting them if you’re not a 17-year-old Zoella-type,’ says Claire. How we make money ‘We’re finally making money out of it, but not enough to retire on yet,’ says Lucy. ‘In the past six months, brands have really opened up to collaborations. We have endorsed British Lion Eggs, Tesco, Flora and Lakeland, and we have an ongoing relationship with Lizi’s Granola. We’re talking four-figure amounts for each sponsorship deal. ‘Advertising only pays a substantial amount if something goes viral, such as our Halloween soup, which got a couple of million views after it was picked up by AOL’s news website. Any money we make is split with the production company, instead of us paying them.’ What’s next? ‘I would love to give YouTube more time and do it as my main job,’ says Claire. ‘It’s seat-of-your-pants stuff; nobody knows how vlogs are going to pan out in the future. But for now I’m really enjoying it.’ youtube.com/crumbsfood   The Bloke Next Door Barry Lewis of My Virgin Kitchen Who Barry Lewis, 34, from Somerset, whose channel is called My Virgin Kitchen. Viewing figures More than 550,000 subscribers and almost 68 million views. USP Everything Barry makes is a personal first (hence the channel’s name), and he aims to make you ‘laugh and learn’ with quirky recipes (Super Mario Cupcakes) as well as everyday staples (Shepherd’s Pie). Most popular recipe His Giant Rolo (which he made in a bucket) has had more than 2.5 million views. ‘I put out novelty recipes on a Sunday and my super-size series is really popular,’ says Barry. How it happened ‘I was working as a quantity surveyor and had no confidence in the kitchen, leaving the cooking to my wife Becky. Then six years ago, after watching Jamie Oliver poach an egg on TV, I thought, “That looks easy,” and gave it a go. I filmed myself with a camcorder and it became my first vlog. Recording my cookery journey has been a way of inspiring myself to keep on learning.  How to be a successful vlogger  Choose a subject you are passionate about Don’t have a script or slick production techniques and don’t worry about cock-ups. Join the YouTube Partner Programme After making your first video (uploading is free on YouTube), become a partner to allow Google to place adverts next to your content. Anyone can join the programme, and the deal is you share the advertising revenue with YouTube (it takes 45 per cent). The more clicks your video has, the more money you earn. The rates Google sets are variable, but expect to earn from 0.1p to 1p per view. Have a weekly slot YouTube recommends that you establish a regular publishing schedule (eg, post every Wednesday) to encourage your audience to come back. Advertise your new upload on your channel and through social media. Make it watchable YouTube search results are based largely on ‘watch time’. If people click away after 30 seconds your video won’t feature high in search results. Check out Google Analytics (a free tool) to see when people stopped watching, then find out why. Appeal to millennials The YouTube audience tends to be under 34, so you’ll get more hits if you have content relevant to them. You don’t have to be that age yourself, but keeping on top of trends helps. 'Soon I was making (and filming) dinner every night, and I gave up sport at the weekend in favour of baking muffins. What began as overcoming a fear turned into a hobby and then a job. Three years ago I took a career break so I could concentrate on YouTube. Becky was a little sceptical but two weeks in, I had an agent and a book deal [Dinner’s On, out now]. I never went back to my old job.’ The filming process ‘I’m self-taught on that front, too. I’ve invested in a better camera and tripod. At the start my videos were very rough and ten minutes long; now they’re around four minutes. People like that it’s simply me at home, with my pugs and children [Phoebe, eight, and Chloe, four] running around. I don’t think of it as presenting; I imagine I’m talking to a colleague.’ Hours put in ‘I treat YouTubing like a full-time job, working nine to five, five days a week. I put out new videos three times a week, then there’s editing, research, preparation and social media. I used to reply to every comment, but there are more than 1,000 tutorials on my channel now, so I just reply when I can.’ Who watches ‘The average age of my subscribers is 18 to 34, with a 50/50 male-female split. Most are from the US, so I cater for them with peanut butter recipes. Germany is also a biggie – when I tried German treats (such as Underberg digestif) I got more than a million views.’ Worst on-camera mistake ‘YouTube followers don’t want a polished performance so the bloopers and mess stay in. If one of my girls tips a bag of flour over her head, so be it. I made a batch of ice lollies once and dropped them all over the floor, but people seemed to like that. Daft stuff gets watched, so this morning I sucked the air out of a helium balloon before presenting a very squeaky tutorial.’ Proudest YouTube moment ‘I could say the book deal, but actually it’s that cooking has brought me closer to the kids. They enjoy making cakes with me and absolutely love being in the videos. Phoebe wants her own channel when she grows up.’ How I make money ‘Sponsorship tops up the advertising earnings. Phoebe and I appeared in a Sainsbury’s advert, which gained her kudos in the playground. I’m not making millions, but I’m earning as much as I did when I was a surveyor.’ What’s next? ‘Becky has just come on board and has her own weekly baking section on the vlog. She used to work full-time at a children’s daycare centre but I thought she was working too hard and I wanted her to have fun so I encouraged her to quit. In the future, we may employ a cameraman to film us baking together, but for now we shoot our segments ourselves.’ youtube.com/myvirginkitchen   The Cupcake Queen Jemma Wilson, aka Cupcake Jemma  Who Jemma Wilson, aka Cupcake Jemma, 37, from London. Viewing figures More than 800,000 subscribers and more than 54 million views. USP Insanely delicious sweet treats (think Salted Caramel Chocolate Mudslide Cupcakes). ‘I’m fun, I don’t put on an act, and I make tasty, pretty cakes. I also have tattoos, which is the kind of thing teenagers watching YouTube aspire to,’ Jemma says. Most popular recipe Her six-layer rainbow cake has been watched more than three million times. ‘It’s a 16-minute tutorial, which is really long by YouTube standards, so I’m amazed that people sit through until the end,’ says Jemma. How it happened ‘I had dropped out of a graphic design degree and was working in a bar when I discovered baking. I taught myself and love the magical process. Soon I had a market stall on London’s Brick Lane, selling 1,000 cakes and cookies a day. A stall at a street party to celebrate the tenth birthday of Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant led to a meeting with the man himself. I guess Jamie liked me because eight months later, in June 2013, he invited me to have my own tutorial channel on his Food Tube network. At first Jamie’s production crew filmed me, but soon my business partner Sam [also Jemma’s ex-boyfriend] took over. Now it’s just the two of us with one camcorder so we have complete control over the Cupcake Jemma channel.’ The filming process ‘Back in the day we shot in my mum’s kitchen. Then in December 2014, with savings accrued through the market stall, plus £10,000 from a crowdfunding campaign, we opened a shop in Soho called Crumbs and Doilies. It has given my YouTube followers something tangible, a place where they can taste what they’ve seen online, with 75 cupcake varieties on sale. We film there when the bakers have left. The pressure of giving a clean performance when you’ve got a camera in your face is huge. I try to be myself, but just swear a lot less!’ Vlogging can reach millions of people on a shoestring budget  Hours put in ‘Filming can take anything from an hour and a half to five hours for a layer cake. Then there’s all the preparation. If I’m using ice cream, I have to churn it and freeze it the night before. We put a new recipe online once a week.’ Who watches ‘Predominantly 18- to 25-year-old women from the UK, US and Australia. The majority of followers who visit the shop are younger, such as the ten-year-old mega-fan who brought me a Malteser cupcake he’d made after watching my tutorial. He was beside himself with excitement when I gave him a tour of the kitchen.’ Worst on-camera mistake ‘Making caramel on air is always a disaster. Sugar catches quickly, so if it is ready but the camera isn’t, you get a pan of burnt sugar.’ Proudest YouTube moment ‘Hitting 38 million views [by comparison Coronation Street gets an average of 6-7 million viewers per episode]. Plus having fans come to the shop to say hello – it always amazes me that they want to meet me.’ How I make money ‘I’m unusual for a successful YouTuber in that it’s not my career – the shop is my priority. Anyone who makes a living from YouTube does so from sponsorship deals, not adverts, which pay peanuts. I’m fussy about the brands I work with because I’m very particular about ingredients. I’ve developed a cupcake for PG Tips, used Hotpoint ovens in my videos and I created a flower-decorated cake for the Grow Wild campaign. But if some rubbish margarine brand says it will sponsor me for a year, I’ll say no. It has to be something I believe in.’ What’s next? ‘Having my own TV show was never the dream for me as you can reach millions of people vlogging in your kitchen on a shoestring budget, while retaining control over content. It’s democratic and attainable. Having said that, I am a guest judge on Sugar Showdown, a US TV baking competition. I’m up for broadening my horizons and getting out of my comfort zone, so if the right project comes along and it happens to be television, I’d be silly not to consider it.’ youtube.com/cupcakejemma   Share or comment on this article e-mail 40 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Next Article Space: the Ultimate Network Edge Racks of servers inside an IBM SoftLayer data center (Photo: IBM) DCK, Featured Top 5 Data Center Stories: Week of October 14 by Data Center Knowledge  on October 15, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet For your weekend reading, here are this week’s most popular stories on Data Center Knowledge: Cloud by the Megawatt: Inside IBM’s Cloud Data Center Strategy – All major US hardware vendors have tried and failed to become formidable rivals to Amazon in the cutthroat cloud infrastructure market; all except IBM, which continues to expand both technological capabilities of its cloud and the global infrastructure that makes it all possible. Here’s Google’s Plan for Calming Enterprise Cloud Anxiety – It will embed its own experts on cloud customers’ teams to help them deploy and run applications in Google’s cloud data centers in the most reliable way possible. Cloud Fuels Unprecedented Data Center Boom in Northern Virginia – A convergence of fiber networks, undersea cables, and its many existing data centers continue to attract a disproportionately large share of all data center construction and leasing leasing activity to the area, and today, the market is only getting hotter. Space Laser Network to Beam Bandwidth into Equinix Data Centers – The world’s bandwidth needs continue to skyrocket, but not every place on the planet is easily accessible for construction of terrestrial networks, prompting some companies to invest in commercializing connectivity via optical signals sent through the air, or, in Laser Light’s case, through the atmosphere. VMware Gives AWS Keys to Its Enterprise Data Center Kingdom – The move, aimed squarely at the enterprise market, is a strategic about-face for both companies, who in the past viewed each other as competition. As the world’s biggest provider of cloud infrastructure services, Amazon has been perceived as a huge competitive threat to VMware’s ubiquitous presence in enterprise data centers.

Spokane-raised Klara Bowman, fired Tacoma teacher, struggled with loss of sister and addiction By Matt Driscoll The News Tribune Twitter Facebook Email Reddit When I pull up to the corn-yellow house with dark green trim on Spokane’s South Hill, Tom Bowman and Robin Einerson are waiting for me. It’s a neighborhood where it’s hard to imagine anything going wrong: leafy and green even in the middle of Eastern Washington’s unrelenting summer – a mix of fired-brick houses, modest bungalows, Craftsman homes and the occasional dignified estate with prominent white columns out front. Retirees and landscaping companies fill the air with the sound of lawnmowers, while mothers in athletic gear push strollers up and down cozy sidewalks. Robin meets me at the door. She’s cordial, but cautious. For everything her family has been through in the past year, it’s an understandable reception for a member of the media. In March, the couple’s daughter, Klara, a kindergarten teacher in Tacoma, made national headlines when she was fired for being intoxicated at work. Three months later, she was dead. Tom, an artist who’s worked primarily in advertising, and Robin, a pastoral assistant at the family’s church, will celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary next year. They’ve lived in this house on Post Street since 1986, when Klara was 3. If the walls of their home could talk, they’d speak of joy and love. They’d recall Klara, as a little girl, playing make-believe school, leading classes of imaginary students, and later her little sister and only sibling, Brita. They’d recall the summer camps that Klara organized for the younger neighborhood kids in the family’s backyard. Using the name of the street she grew up on, Klara called the annual one-day retreat “Camp Post.” “Just the All-American kid,” a wistful Tom said of his oldest daughter. These walls also have seen more than their share of sorrow. As we sit in Tom and Robin’s living room, with Klara’s cats slinking underfoot, the void is inescapable. In late January 1998, Brita Bowman, then 10, passed away after an 18-month battle with cancer. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the precise medical name for the disease that claimed her. It’s a wound, her parents confide, that Klara – who was 14 when Brita died – carried with her for the rest of her life. Klara’s story, on the other hand, is one with trauma and addiction at its center. Like roughly 17 million people in the United States, she battled alcoholism. Unlike most, however, Klara’s struggle was very public. It’s a struggle that ended in early June, when she took her own life. She was 33. Overnight pariah You might remember Klara Bowman’s name – maybe even the smiling photograph of her that’s now plastered all over the internet, grabbed by a thirsty media during her moment of infamy. The story broke March 7. Klara – who grew from a child teaching make-believe lessons to a real-life kindergarten teacher in Tacoma – was fired from Larchmont Elementary, removed from her classroom with a blood-alcohol level five times the legal driving limit. Klara’s mistake was news for a reason. She was a public employee, responsible for a classroom full of 5- and 6-year-olds. When it was revealed that this was not the first time she’d faced discipline for an alcohol-related transgression while working for Tacoma Public Schools, many parents and observers expressed outrage. Predictably, media outlets across the country – from the News Tribune to the Associated Press, USA Today and NY Daily News – ran with the story. Tacoma TV and radio covered Bowman’s firing breathlessly, teasing the sordid details – like the number of booze bottles found hidden in her classroom, or how she walked into a wall in front of a class of fourth-graders on her way out – in a frenzy of detached fascination. Online commenters had a field day. Whether a line of decency was crossed in the media’s coverage remains a matter of opinion. “I begged reporters not to use her name … even though they had the right to do so,” recalled Tacoma Public Schools spokesman Dan Voelpel. “While her actions meant she could no longer teach for us, she did not deserve to be publicly shamed.” The impact was immediate. Within days, a Google search for Klara Bowman revealed page after page of headlines about Tacoma’s “drunken teacher.” The night the story broke, her parents and friends say, reporters converged on her small house in University Place, hoping to catch a glimpse and a soundbite. “You could tell it affected her,” longtime friend Stephanie Sleeman said of the relentless coverage. “(Klara) talked about coming to Spokane and starting over,” Robin said. “She talked about, ‘Maybe I should just go someplace really far away, where I could just start anew.’ ” Still, in the aftermath of her firing, those close to Klara held out hope that she’d find a way to rebound. They prayed that this time would be different and that she’d finally found her rock bottom. Shortly after she was let go by Tacoma Public Schools, Klara went through a 28-day inpatient rehab program in Yakima and for the first time began to talk about herself as an alcoholic who would never be able to drink again – an acknowledgment she had been reluctant to make in the past. “She was so hopeful. We were so hopeful. She’d finally been able to work with some really skilled people to figure out why she’d been drinking,” Robin said of Klara’s trip to inpatient treatment – which, like with many alcoholics, was not her first attempt at sobriety. In late May, Klara texted her friends and family with what seemed like good news: She’d officially changed her name to Klara Einerson, taking her mother’s maiden name. In hindsight, friends and family now see the decision as indicative of her struggle to cope with the unwanted notoriety that accompanied her mistake. “She wanted to move on. She was talking about what she should do next,” said Sleeman. “And, from a practical standpoint, (the name Klara Bowman) was so easy to Google. “I just thought it was a great idea. Close this chapter, and move forward.” But a week later, Klara was gone. Today, Klara’s obituary is the top Google result when you search her name. Like many newspapers, the News Tribune – which learned of Klara’s death shortly after it happened – has a general policy against covering the suicides of private individuals. For Klara Bowman, that meant the biggest mistake of her professional career got prominent play in the paper, but when she took her own life – a decision friends and family say was at least in part influenced by the exhaustive coverage her downfall at Larchmont received – it went unreported. “Nobody deserves to be lambasted like that in the media,” lamented Diana Sailer, a Grant Center for the Expressive Arts kindergarten and first-grade teacher who befriended Klara during her first year teaching in Tacoma. “The story of who Klara was got lost, and the only picture that came out about Klara was that here was this drunk teaching kids.” Sailer describes the media coverage as “unforgivable.” And she’s not alone. “I think that what she lived through is so bad it’s hard for me to imagine,” said Ann Dowsett Johnston, an expert in alcohol policy and author of the 2013 book “Drink: The Intimate Relationship Between Women and Alcohol.” “To be publicly shamed … I’m not sure how you get over something like that.” Johnston’s book – which details the author’s own battle with alcoholism while also looking at the ways alcohol impacts the lives of women – resonated with Bowman, according to Robin. “I actually see this as a witch hunt,” Johnston said. Klara’s mistake at Larchmont “was a cry for help. She was in full-blown addiction.” From their living room in Spokane, two months after their daughter’s death, Tom and Robin say they still resent the way the story unfolded. They understand why Klara’s firing was news, but wrestle with the way it was handled and the impact it had on their daughter. “I said, ‘They’re going to pounce on it,’ ” Tom Bowman said of the media circus. “And they did.” A picture of Klara Bowman at the home of her parents, Robin Einerson and Tom Bowman, in Spokane.

(Kathy Plonka / The Spokesman-Review) A natural There was much more to Klara Bowman than alcohol, addiction and despair. She was adventurous and traveled extensively, visiting 39 countries during her lifetime. Like her father, she was an artist; her paintings cover the family’s home. She had a passion for hiking and a soft spot for “I Love Lucy.” Friends remember her dry sense of humor and her comedic timing. More than anything, Klara loved to teach. And kindergarten was her calling. Robin describes Klara as full of energy, creativity and compassion. She tells stories of Klara “scouring yard sales for coats that would fit her kids,” because, teaching in Tacoma, some of her students couldn’t afford them. “She couldn’t bear to see them shivering at recess,” Robin explains. Like Diana Sailer, Angel Morton met Klara during Bowman’s first year of teaching at Grant Center for the Expressive Arts in Tacoma. The three educators became instant friends. “She had a ton of energy, and she just really believed in what she was doing,” said Morton, now president of Tacoma’s teachers union. “It was not a job, for her.” “It seemed to come natural to her,” Sailer added. “Kids recognize that. They get that. They know when someone’s genuine, when you’re not faking it. I think that was (Klara’s) gift. She was just so genuine. The kids adored her. “They just thought the sun came up with her and went down with her at night.” Societal problem To hear her friends and family tell it, Klara Bowman was one of a kind. “Her sense of adventure was nonstop. She would do anything to have a crazy new experience,” said Elizabeth Warren, who grew up in the same Spokane neighborhood as Klara and last exchanged text messages with her a week before her death. But in her long struggle with alcohol she was far from alone. According to Dr. David Jernigan, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health who’s been working on alcohol policy issues for 30 years, we live in a culture that has normalized risky drinking behaviors, and the consequences have been profound. The CDC reports that excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for an average of 88,000 deaths each year and cost the United States $249 billion in 2010. The agency said over half of these deaths and three-quarters of the costs are due to binge drinking – defined as four or more drinks for women on a single occasion, and five or more drinks on a single occasion for men. The CDC reports that one in six adults in the U.S. binge drinks roughly four times a month, consuming about eight drinks each time. Klara’s parents say she began binge drinking in college. While unsafe drinking habits are largely accepted in our society, losing control is clearly not. And the story of Klara Bowman is a prime example. “We live in a culture that normalizes risky drinking, and we kind of blame the person who can’t handle it,” Johnston said. “We throw people under the bus who get into trouble.” This picture of Klara, left and Brita Bowman is on the wall at the home of their parents, Robin Einerson and Tom Bowman, in Spokane. Klara Bowman took her own life three months after she was fired for being intoxicated on the job as an elementary school teacher in Tacoma. It was the culmination of a long struggle with alcohol that seemed to be rooted in the death of her younger sister, Brita. (Kathy Plonka / The Spokesman-Review) Numbing the pain The public learned a lot of things about Klara Bowman when she was fired for being intoxicated at work Feb. 19, including many of the details of her history of alcohol struggles while employed by Tacoma Public Schools. In 2011, while she was at Grant, an incident Feb. 23 of that year resulted in a last-chance agreement with the district and her reassignment to Larchmont. But what the public never learned was that both incidents occurred within weeks of the anniversary of Brita’s death. No one – including her parents – believes the timing was coincidental. “Every January or February, around that anniversary, Klara went missing,” Sleeman remembered. “I don’t even know where she’d go. She would just kind of run away. She ran when things got too rough. “We always knew when that time was coming, and it happened every year, to the day almost.” Warren, who grew up with Klara and witnessed firsthand the way Klara dealt with her sister’s death as a teenager, describes Brita’s death as “definitely a milestone in her life,” and one that marked “a noticeable change” for her friend. She said Klara coped with the tragedy by filling her life with activity. And while so many outward signs seemed positive – Klara was elected a class president in high school, got good grades and continued to play soccer at a high level – Warren now believes her friend “learned to compartmentalize,” and “probably never learned to really take care of herself, for her own sake.” Along with turning to alcohol, Robin said Klara battled an eating disorder and depression in high school. Later, she had trouble sleeping and suffered from anxiety. Over the course of her life, Robin said, doctors offered diagnoses and various prescribed medications, but none of it seemed to ease her pain. Robin now views it as part of a lifelong search for relief. Relief that never came. “It was definitely a reaction to (Brita’s death),” said Robin, who acknowledged harboring significant guilt about not paying enough attention to Klara, especially while Brita battled cancer, which included a bone marrow transplant and a lengthy stay in Seattle for treatments at Swedish Medical Center. “My regrets are, when she was younger, after Brita died, maybe I just wasn’t really there for her,” Robin said. To experts like Johnston, the details of Klara’s story – including the role the death of her sister played – sound familiar. She describes alcoholism as an affliction that’s often deeply rooted in trauma, isolation and self-medication. For Tom and Robin, the takeaway is clear. “She told us that she had her first drink on the one-year anniversary of Brita’s death. And she said, ‘I loved it!’ Obviously, she was saying it’s the only thing that made the pain go away,” Robin said. “When she found alcohol, and that really numbed it. …” The grieving mother looks out the living room window and trails off. Meanwhile, friends are left to wonder what more they could have done. “I think the hard thing for all of us was none of us knew how hard it was for her. None of us understood what was going on beneath the surface,” Morton said. “She was just a lovely, lovely person who was damn good at whatever she put her mind to, except for supporting herself.” Klara’s last words Robin got the text at 2:23 a.m. At the time, she tells me, she didn’t realize its significance. I love you so very much, momma. “That’s all it said,” Robin remembers of her final message from Klara. It’s hard to picture a scene further removed from Klara Bowman’s childhood home than the Century Motel in Kent, Washington. It’s an establishment where patrons check in through a small, glass-protected window, and the sound of cars speeding past on nearby Interstate 5 is constant. When I tapped on the glass, a skeptical looking woman appeared only to tell me she has no recollection of Klara Bowman. But it’s here, on the second-floor balcony outside the door of Room 210, where Bowman was found unresponsive on the afternoon of June 5. “I can’t even imagine what drew her there,” Robin said. Police reports and documents from the King County Medical Examiner’s Office write the tragic final chapter of Klara Bowman’s life. Officers arrived at the Century Motel just before 2 p.m., responding to a call about an unconscious female lying on the ground with no pulse. Management told police that Klara checked in at 2 a.m. and checked out at 11 a.m. No one is sure why she returned to the motel that afternoon, a day when temperatures reached 93 degrees. Klara was transported to Valley Medical Center and died the following day, after Tom and Robin had traveled over the mountains from Spokane to be by their daughter’s side. “They put her on a ventilator and gave her enough meds to stimulate her heart for us to get over there,” Robin recalls. The Medical Examiner’s Office ruled Klara’s death a suicide, the result of a lethal combination of ethanol intoxication, over-the-counter medications and prescription drugs. It’s a finding her parents reluctantly accept. The suicide attempt was not Bowman’s first; her friends and parents said she tried to take her own life on at least one other occasion, after her first alcohol-related incident at Grant. The medical examiner’s suicide finding also fit with several other “ominous” text messages police said Klara sent prior to her death. Friends woke up to messages including “Done with life” and “Help.” In committing suicide, Klara fell into another well-established pattern related to alcohol abuse. Dr. Alex Crosby, an expert on suicide prevention in the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control’s Division of Violence Prevention, said there’s clear consensus that alcohol is what he calls a “major risk factor for suicidal behavior.” According to the CDC’s Alcohol-Related Disease Impact application – which uses the best-available scientific evidence to estimate deaths due to excessive drinking across 54 alcohol-related conditions – 23 percent of suicide deaths from 2006 to 2010 were attributable to binge drinking. “I call alcohol the great co-factor, in that it causes such an enormous amount of health and social damage, but it mostly doesn’t get the notice it deserves, because people die of something else, like suicide, cancer or a car crash,” said Dr. Jernigan. Klara Bowman’s death is now just such a sobering statistic. “I have a lot of questions. But I just have to let it go,” Robin said of her daughter’s death. “That’s just the nature of what happened.” Robin Einerson and Tom Bowman’s home in Spokane is filled with paintings by their daughter Klara Bowman. The middle painting is the last piece that Klara worked on. (Kathy Plonka / The Spokesman-Review) Memories live on Before I head back to Tacoma, Robin contacts me and says she has something she wants me to see. She says it’s important. On a laptop, set up on the dining room table, she’s cued up the 10-minute video that played at Klara’s memorial services this summer. It’s a simple production, a collection of photos from her daughter’s 33 years of life set to music. They’re songs Klara would have appreciated: the theme from “Peanuts” and “I Love Lucy,” and ABBA’s “Dancing Queen.” In deciding to share their late daughter’s story, Klara’s parents hope to inspire conversations about how people view alcoholism and addiction. A family of faith, Tom tells me that they believe Klara will have an impact even after death. “Our concern is on the big picture. What is life? Nobody gets out alive. What happens afterward, what happens in this life, that’s as important to us as how you exit,” Tom said. “I think Klara is still doing good after death. She is being used by a bigger hand than us.” As the video plays, Robin begins to cry. The images on the small computer screen capture her daughter as she remembers her, she said. In Robin’s memories, Klara is smiling, laughing, traveling, teaching and loving. Living life. “She was not just one of my daughters,” Robin said. “She was one of my very best friends.” This is the Klara Bowman people who saw her story on the news never got to know. And this is the Klara that her mother desperately wants people to see now. Robin Einerson and Tom Bowman are surrounded by pictures and paintings by their daughter Klara Bowman at their home in Spokane.

Article tools PDF Rights & Permissions Subject terms: Technology Ethics Society Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/TNS/Getty Chicago police use algorithmic systems to predict which people are most likely to be involved in a shooting, but they have proved largely ineffective. This week, the White House published its report on the future of artificial intelligence (AI) — a product of four workshops held between May and July 2016 in Seattle, Pittsburgh, Washington DC and New York City (see go.nature.com/2dx8rv6). During these events (which we helped to organize), many of the world’s leading thinkers from diverse fields discussed how AI will change the way we live. Dozens of presentations revealed the promise of using progress in machine learning and other AI techniques to perform a range of complex tasks in every­day life. These ranged from the identification of skin alterations that are indicative of early-stage cancer to the reduction of energy costs for data centres. The workshops also highlighted a major blind spot in thinking about AI. Auto­nomous systems are already deployed in our most crucial social institutions, from hospitals to courtrooms. Yet there are no agreed methods to assess the sustained effects of such applications on human populations. Recent years have brought extraordinary advances in the technical domains of AI. Alongside such efforts, designers and researchers from a range of disciplines need to conduct what we call social-systems analyses of AI. They need to assess the impact of technologies on their social, cultural and political settings. A social-systems approach could investigate, for instance, how the app AiCure — which tracks patients’ adherence to taking prescribed medication and transmits records to physicians — is changing the doctor–patient relationship. Such an approach could also explore whether the use of historical data to predict where crimes will happen is driving overpolicing of marginalized communities. Or it could investigate why high-rolling investors are given the right to understand the financial decisions made on their behalf by humans and algorithms, whereas low-income loan seekers are often left to wonder why their requests have been rejected. A singular problem “People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they’re too stupid and they’ve already taken over the world.” This is how computer scientist Pedro Domingos sums up the issue in his 2015 book The Master Algorithm1. Even the many researchers who reject the prospect of a ‘technological singularity’ — saying the field is too young — support the introduction of relatively untested AI systems into social institutions. In part thanks to the enthusiasm of AI researchers, such systems are already being used by physicians to guide diagnoses. They are also used by law firms to advise clients on the likelihood of their winning a case, by financial institutions to help decide who should receive loans, and by employers to guide whom to hire. Analysts are expecting the uses of AI systems in these and other contexts to soar. Current market analyses put the economic value of AI applications in the billion-dollar range (see ‘On the rise’), and IBM’s chief executive Ginni Rometty has said that she sees a US$2-trillion opportunity in AI systems over the coming decade. Admittedly, estimates are difficult to make, in part because there is no consensus on what counts as AI. Source: CB Insights AI will not necessarily be worse than human-operated systems at making predictions and guiding decisions. On the contrary, engineers are optimistic that AI can help to detect and reduce human bias and prejudice. But studies indicate that in some current contexts, the downsides of AI systems disproportionately affect groups that are already disadvantaged by factors such as race, gender and socio-economic background2. In a 2013 study, for example, Google searches of first names commonly used by black people were 25% more likely to flag up advertisements for a criminal-records search than those of ‘white-identifying’ names3. In another race-related finding, a ProPublica investigation in May 2016 found that the proprietary algorithms widely used by judges to help determine the risk of reoffending are almost twice as likely to mistakenly flag black defendants than white defendants (see go.nature.com/29aznyw). Three tools How can such effects be avoided? So far, there have been three dominant modes of responding to concerns about the social and ethical impacts of AI systems: compliance, ‘values in design’ and thought experiments. All three are valuable. None is individually or collectively sufficient. Deploy and comply.Most commonly, companies and others take basic steps to adhere to a set of industry best practices or legal obligations, so as to avoid government, press or other scrutiny. This approach can produce short-term benefits. Google, for example, tweaked its image-recognition algorithm in 2015 after the system mislabelled an African American couple as gorillas. The company has also proposed introducing a ‘red button’ into its AI systems that researchers could press should the system seem to be getting out of control4. Similarly, Facebook made an exception to its rule of removing images of nude children from its site after the public backlash about its censorship of the Pulitzer-prizewinning photograph of a naked girl, Kim Phúc, fleeing a napalm attack in Vietnam. And just last month, several leading AI companies, including Microsoft, Amazon and IBM, formed the Partnership on AI to try to advance public understanding and develop some shared standards. Yet the ‘deploy and comply’ approach can be ad hoc and reactive, and industry efforts can prove inadequate if they lack sufficient critical voices and independent contributors. The new AI partnership is inviting ethicists and civil-society organizations to participate. But the concern remains that corporations are relatively free to field test their AI systems on the public without sustained research on medium- or even near-term effects. Values in design.Thanks to pioneers in the ethical design of technology,including the influential scholars Batya Friedman and Helen Nissenbaum, researchers and firms now deploy frameworks such as value sensitive design or ‘responsible innovation’ to help them to identify likely stakeholders and their values. Focus groups or other techniques are used to establish people’s views about personal privacy, the environment and so on. The values of prospective users are then incorporated into the design of the technology, whether it is a phone app or a driverless car5. Developers of AI systems should draw on these important methods more. Nevertheless, such tools often work on the assumption that the system will be built. They are less able to help designers, policymakers or society to decide whether a system should be built at all, or when a proto­type is too preliminary or unreliable to be unleashed on infrastructure such as hospitals or courtrooms. Craig F. Walker/Denver Post/Getty People with asthma were wrongly graded as low risk by an AI system designed to predict pneumonia. Thought experiments.In the past few years, hypothetical situations have dominated the public debate around the social impacts of AI. The possibility that humans will create a highly intelligent system that will ultimately rule over us or even destroy us has been most discussed (see, for example, ref. 6). Also, one relevant thought experiment from 1967 — the trolley problem — has taken on new life. This scenario raises questions about responsibility and culpability. In it, a person can either let a runaway trolley car run along a track where five men are working, or pull a lever to redirect the trolley on to another track where only one person is at risk. Various commentators have applied this hypothetical scenario to self-driving cars, which they argue will have to make automated decisions that constitute ethical choices7. Yet as with the robot apocalypse, the possibility of a driverless car weighing up ‘kill decisions’ presents a narrow frame for moral reasoning. The trolley problem offers little guidance on the wider social issues at hand: the value of a massive investment in autonomous cars rather than in public transport; how safe a driverless car should be before it is allowed to navigate the world (and what tools should be used to determine this); and the potential effects of autonomous vehicles on congestion, the environment or employment. Social-systems analysis We believe that a fourth approach is needed. A practical and broadly applicable social-systems analysis thinks through all the possible effects of AI systems on all parties. It also engages with social impacts at every stage — conception, design, deployment and regulation. As a first step, researchers — across a range of disciplines, government departments and industry — need to start investigating how differences in communities’ access to information, wealth and basic services shape the data that AI systems train on. Take, for example, the algorithm-generated ‘heat maps’ used in Chicago, Illinois, to identify people who are most likely to be involved in a shooting. A study8 published last month indicates that such maps are ineffective: they increase the likelihood that certain people will be targeted by the police, but do not reduce crime. A social-systems approach would consider the social and political history of the data on which the heat maps are based. This might require consulting members of the community and weighing police data against this feedback, both positive and negative, about the neighbourhood policing. It could also mean factoring in findings by oversight committees and legal institutions. A social-systems analysis would also ask whether the risks and rewards of the system are being applied evenly — so in this case, whether the police are using similar techniques to identify which officers are likely to engage in misconduct, say, or violence. “Artificial intelligence presents a cultural shift as much as a technical one.” As another example, a 2015 study9 showed that a machine-learning technique used to predict which hospital patients would develop pneumonia complications worked well in most situations. But it made one serious error: it instructed doctors to send patients with asthma home even though such people are in a high-risk category. Because the hospital automatically sent patients with asthma to intensive care, these people were rarely on the ‘required further care’ records on which the system was trained. A social-systems analysis would look at the underlying hospital guidelines, and other factors such as insurance policies, that shape patient records9. A social-systems analysis could similarly ask whether and when people affected by AI systems get to ask questions about how such systems work. Financial advisers have been historically limited in the ways they can deploy machine learning because clients expect them to unpack and explain all decisions. Yet so far, individuals who are already subjected to determinations resulting from AI have no analogous power10. A social-systems analysis needs to draw on philosophy, law, sociology, anthropology and science-and-technology studies, among other disciplines. It must also turn to studies of how social, political and cultural values affect and are affected by technological change and scientific research. Only by asking broader questions about the impacts of AI can we generate a more holistic and integrated understanding than that obtained by analysing aspects of AI in silos such as computer science or criminology. There are promising signs. Workshops such as the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning meeting being held in New York City next month is a good example. But funders — governments, foundations and corporations — should be investing much more in efforts that approach AI in the way we describe. Artificial intelligence presents a cultural shift as much as a technical one. This is similar to technological inflection points of the past, such as the introduction of the printing press or the railways. Autonomous systems are changing workplaces, streets and schools. We need to ensure that those changes are beneficial, before they are built further into the infrastructure of every­day life.

While it does generate a list of real people who may be more likely to be involved in violent crime, it does not give the police the right to go round up all of them and detain them for some period of time to prevent their involvement. They might talk with these people, but the laws prevent them from detaining them before a crime has been begun. Laws provide other limits on police actions which I'm not intimately familiar with. CBS-TV had a popular fiction series titled "Person of Interest" which featured a computer which produced such a list. The main characters could get away with a lot more actions to try to prevent the possible crimes, than the Chicago Police can do legally in the real world.

Elkin Neither you nor I will ever buy a Galaxy Note 7, Samsung’s top-of-the-line smartphone, and I’m reasonably sure that we will never even have an opportunity to buy a Galaxy Note 8. But although the epic disaster of the Galaxy Note 7 is a major setback to Samsung in the global phone business, I wouldn’t write off the company and its phones for good just yet. Ford is still selling millions of cars every year, even though one infamous Ford product – the early-1970s Pinto – notoriously burst into flame when struck with even modest force from the rear. Ford’s return to prosperity occurred despite a memo that came out in litigation over the Pinto, which demonstrated that Ford had decided against making an inexpensive fix to the Pinto’s dangerously exposed fuel tank after calculating (or, as it turned out, grossly miscalculating) that it would be cheaper to pay damage claims for any resulting injuries or deaths. Ford even burnished its reputation by launching a 1980s ad campaign under the slogan, “Quality is Job 1.” Hyundai took a similar, though less dramatic, tack to overcome a reputation for poor quality earned by its first export to America, the Hyundai Excel. To sever the association of its name with cheap and shoddy products, Hyundai pushed a warranty longer than any of its competitors offered and, notably, also improved the basic quality of its vehicles. The Excel line was terminated and replaced by the Accent, which is still in production. Hyundai now enjoys a reputation for high quality and reliability. I have one myself, a Hyundai Santa Fe SUV. My wife loves that car. According to The Wall Street Journal, Hyundai Motor Company has enjoyed 4.5 percent market share in U.S. car sales in 2016, ranking it seventh among major automakers. Its sister company, Kia Motors, ranks 10th. Hyundai Motor Group, which acquired its interest in Kia in the late 1990s, chose to market Kias under a sportier, more youthful image in part because Hyundais were by then a hit with more mature customers – at least partly because of the brand’s restored reputation. Hyundai’s fellow South Korean company Samsung would do well to keep the automaker’s success in mind as it plans a way forward in the wake of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. Samsung released the Galaxy Note 7 in August, and the company had high hopes the cutting-edge model would challenge the dominance of the iPhone. Reviewers heaped the device with praise ahead of its launch, and it beat both the iPhone 7 and Google’s new Pixel phone to the sales floor. But anticipation turned to disaster when dozens of users reported their shiny new smartphones catching fire. The hazard was serious enough to trigger the Federal Aviation Administration to demand passengers refrain from using or charging the phones in flight, and forbidding them in checked baggage. In early September, the situation became severe enough that Samsung suspended sales of the Note 7 and issued a recall. The company offered a refund or a replacement, encouraging the latter. According to Samsung, about half of Note 7 owners had turned in their units as of last month and 90 percent of those who did had opted for a new and supposedly improved Note 7 unit. Unfortunately for Samsung, reports began to arrive that the replacement phones’ batteries were also prone to catch fire. Earlier this week, Samsung instructed users to stop using the Note 7 and retailers to stop selling it. On Tuesday, the company officially announced it would stop making and selling the devices due to ongoing safety concerns. Analysts estimated that scrapping the Note 7 could cost the company up to $17 billion, Reuters reported, as well as substantially damaging the technology company’s global reputation. In the short term, the immediate beneficiaries of Samsung’s Note 7 debacle are its chief global rivals, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) – whose iPhone competes with Samsung’s products at the high end of the smartphone market – and China’s Huawei, which started out competing in the low end but is moving steadily upmarket, especially in sales outside the United States. It also creates space for potentially strong new competitors, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), to market their own devices into the void. (Although Amazon’s first attempt at a smartphone never caught on, Samsung’s mistake may create a tempting opening for it to try again.) But history shows that if a company acknowledges and addresses quality problems, it can eventually recover its reputation with consumers – at least if it has the resources to ride out a bad storm. Hyundai did it. Toyota did it just a few years ago, when a scandal over unintended acceleration cost it huge fines. General Motors did it too, with a massive recall of models whose ignition keys could spontaneously turn off the car’s airbags while the vehicle was in motion. And Volkswagen is in the process of trying to live down its ongoing cheating scandal over rigged tests for diesel engine emissions. On the other hand, when a company is unable to overhaul its product or lacks the resources to convince the public that it has made the needed improvements, a brand or a corporation can die. You will never buy a Yugo automobile in the United States, or anywhere else, ever again – not that you would want to. Serbian manufacturer Zastava still produces a successor to the notorious global flop, but it is marketed under the Fiat name and the company is two-thirds owned by the Italian automaker, with the remaining one-third held by the Serbian government. When a problem is confined to a single brand or product line, discontinuing the line or even just the brand name can be a step toward recovery. Hence my conclusion that Samsung will never again try to market a Galaxy Note. Samsung’s biggest issue may be with cell phone carriers, rather than with consumers. As the holiday season approaches, phone carriers have little reason to push Samsung products when its competitors haven’t recently suffered major scandals or caused unhappy recall customers to visit carriers’ stores. The costs of replacing the high-end Note 7 are going to be steep, and that does not include the loss of customer goodwill for the millions who are going to be inconvenienced by losing access to their devices – in many cases, twice over. My guess is that Samsung will end up absorbing most of those costs. It may have no choice if it wants to remain a major player in the global market rather than suffer the fate that befell Motorola, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Blackberry (NASDAQ:BBRY). Those phone makers lost dominant positions even without a major quality scandal (though they had their hiccups), merely because they failed to keep up with shifting technology and consumer preferences. Samsung will have to pony up to stay on top of the technology curve, even as it invests in extensive marketing to restore its reputation. It will be a heavy lift and it will take time, if the company manages to pull it off at all. As Warren Buffet has famously said, “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.” Samsung may win back customers’ trust, but it will not be overnight. About Larry M. Elkin 530 Articles Affiliation: Palisades Hudson Financial Group Larry M. Elkin, CPA, CFP®, has provided personal financial and tax counseling to a sophisticated client base since 1986. After six years with Arthur Andersen, where he was a senior manager for personal financial planning and family wealth planning, he founded his own firm in Hastings on Hudson, New York in 1992. That firm grew steadily and became the Palisades Hudson organization, which moved to Scarsdale, New York in 2002. The firm expanded to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 2005, and to Atlanta, Georgia, in 2008. Larry received his B.A. in journalism from the University of Montana in 1978, and his M.B.A. in accounting from New York University in 1986. Larry was a reporter and editor for The Associated Press from 1978 to 1986. He covered government, business and legal affairs for the wire service, with assignments in Helena, Montana; Albany, New York; Washington, D.C.; and New York City’s federal courts in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Larry established the organization’s investment advisory business, which now manages more than $800 million, in 1997. As president of Palisades Hudson, Larry maintains individual professional relationships with many of the firm’s clients, who reside in more than 25 states from Maine to California as well as in several foreign countries. He is the author of Financial Self-Defense for Unmarried Couples (Currency Doubleday, 1995), which was the first comprehensive financial planning guide for unmarried couples. He also is the editor and publisher of Sentinel, a quarterly newsletter on personal financial planning. Larry has written many Sentinel articles, including several that anticipated future events. In “The Economic Case Against Tobacco Stocks” (February 1995), he forecast that litigation losses would eventually undermine cigarette manufacturers’ financial position. He concluded in “Is This the Beginning Of The End?” (May 1998) that there was a better-than-even chance that estate taxes would be repealed by 2010, three years before Congress enacted legislation to repeal the tax in 2010. In “IRS Takes A Shot At Split-Dollar Life” (June 1996), Larry predicted that the IRS would be able to treat split dollar arrangements as below-market loans, which came to pass with new rules issued by the Service in 2001 and 2002. More recently, Larry has addressed the causes and consequences of the “Panic of 2008″ in his Sentinel articles. In “Have We Learned Our Lending Lesson At Last” (October 2007) and “Mortgage Lending Lessons Remain Unlearned” (October 2008), Larry questioned whether or not America has learned any lessons from the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. In addition, he offered some practical changes that should have been made to amend the situation. In “Take Advantage Of The Panic Of 2008” (January 2009), Larry offered ways to capitalize on the wealth of opportunity that the panic presented. Larry served as president of the Estate Planning Council of New York City, Inc., in 2005-2006. In 2009 the Council presented Larry with its first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award, citing his service to the organization and “his tireless efforts in promoting our industry by word and by personal example as a consummate estate planning professional.” He is regularly interviewed by national and regional publications, and has made nearly 100 radio and television appearances.

An apology is in order and the Note 8 should have a replaceable battery in which case I’ll buy Samsung products again. Until then there will never be another Samsung product in my house.

When Twitter was first put up for sale, several companies emerged as potential suitors. These parties include Google, Apple, Salesforce and Disney. In recent weeks, however, all parties except Salesforce confirmed that they had retracted their interest in making a purchase. Twitter’s stock had already fallen by over 20 percent after reports that Google, Disney and Apple planned not to make bids. Salesforce, however, wasn’t out of the running just yet. Recently, Salesforce too has declined to make a bid, pushing Twitter’s stock down another seven percent. CNN reports that Twitter may have to remain independent until more promising offers surface. While Twitter apparently laid off eight percent of its staff last year, the company still has over three thousand employees worldwide.

AR uses computer systems as well as some kind of lens or holographic projection to overlay a digital output on top of the real world that you can see. The potential here is obvious. Everything from map directions stretching out in front of you, to radically new types of games or movies that blend reality with fantasy could meld seamlessly with our daily lives. The only problem, of course, is cost. But castAR hope to change that and bring affordable, self-contained AR glasses to everyone. For the past couple of years, virtual reality has really been the only kid on the block. Whether it’s the Gear VR, Oculus, Google Cardboard or the Vive, there’s been a lot more buzz there than for say, Microsoft’s Hololens. And again, a good part of that comes from the extraordinary cost of AR. Google glass, an early pseudo-AR device ran $1500, and Microsoft’s HoloLens comes in at over $3000. That’s in large part due to technical challenges. It’s relatively easy to block out the real world with a screen and just push a totally different image straight at your eyeballs. It’s a radically different proposition to analyze the real world, add information to it, and do so with translucent screens that don’t impair your vision. Plus, VR usually has the benefit of pulling all of its computing power from a nearby PC, whereas the entire point of AR is that you’re free to roam about the real world. Tethers are antithetical to the technology’s goals. For it to work then, you need advanced projection, a robust system to process and render images, and it has to be able to fit into something that’s only a bit larger than a pair of sunglasses. Oh! And it has to be something that your average person could reasonably buy. Simple, right? CastAR hopes to overcome these challenges by hiring the best people it can. While it started as a crowd-funded project by Jeri Ellsworth and Rick Johnson, two former Valve (i.e. one of the companies behind the Vive VR headset) engineers, castAR has since ballooned. It’s gobbling up top talent from various industries and pulling in plenty of venture capital to fuel the expansion. Among their new hires are executives from Disney and Zynga as well as Darrell Rodriguez, former president and of Lucas Arts and COO of a major game publisher Electronic Arts. “The key to bringing this together is hitting every problem on every front,” Rodriguez told me. “Ellsworth is one of the most talented electrical engineers around, and I know she has the foundation set. But we also need to prove to people that this is something they’ll want in their homes, so we’re working on bringing the best experiences we can so that people will have something amazing when they open the box.” To that end, castAR founded a game studio in Salt Lake City, and they’re working closely with plenty of other organizations to make sure the device has around 10 hours of entertainment ready-to-go when the device goes on sale next year. Between their Palo Alto and Salt Lake City locations, the company now has more than 70 employees — all with years of experience in digital entertainment — working to make sure that this will be something special. Despite the pedigree and the momentum behind it, Rodriguez laments that it can be difficult to get people on board with it until they put the headset on. “It’s hard to imagine what it’s really capable of because it’s not like anything you’d see here in the real world. With [castAR] you can have walls come straight up, out of a table so you and a friend can play Battleship, for example.” While it’s still aways off, expect to hear more from castAR in the coming months as the company moves into holding plenty of demos around the US to show people what the set can do.

The move hasn't been confirmed by the company, but it's an extension of its ongoing campaign to push website owners and developers to optimise sites for mobile users as a priority. If it goes ahead with creating a new priority mobile index that's updated much more frequently than its 'secondary' desktop index, it'll severly impact any sites that haven't yet been optimised for mobile. Gary Ilyes, a Google Webmaster Trends analyst, spilled the beans of the upcoming change at the Pubcon conference in Las Vegas, saying that the dual-index approach is due to be implemented in the next few months. Whether or not that date is accurate, if you have a website that's not mobile optimised, you're already missing out on Google traffic (and therefore business) simply by not being mobile-friendly. With smartphone penetration still growing around the world, the number of mobile queries isn't about to go down anytime soon. An entirely separate index could also, potentially, be a boon for users. If Google can surface more accurate results because it can update its index more reliably for mobile sites, the results you get for each query should improve too. Google told The Guardian that it had no news to share at this time, but frequently experiments with how its index works. Related article: Bored at work?

With a few weeks left until the general elections, Google has added new features in Search that make it easier for voters to find out where to vote and who will be on the ballot when they get to the polls. By searching for "who's on my ballot" and entering their addresses, U.S. voters will have access to detailed information on each of the candidates at the federal, state and local levels and their party affiliation by clicking on the candidate's name. By searching for "where to vote" and entering an address, voters can get information on their voting location both for early voting and on Election Day. In addition to making the information available to users via Search, Google is also making the data available to several technology companies, including Uber, Expedia, Twitter and Hotels.com. Non-profits such as the Voting Information Project and Pew Charitable Trusts can also use Google's voting data and the company's Civic Information Application Programming Interface to build their own applications for making election-related data available to the public, the company said in a blog post this week. "From President and Vice President, to Congressperson and County Commissioner, a simple search for "who's on my ballot" will help you find info on the candidates, as well as detailed information on your state's referenda," the company said. Google previously updated its search capabilities to provide information on how to register and how to vote. Individuals can use Google Search to find out if they are registered to vote or how to do so if they are not. The information is available for searches conducted in English and Spanish. In addition Google this week introduced a new "Fact check" tag in articles that appear in Google News to help readers quickly check facts in large news stories. Google has said nothing to indicate the new feature has anything to do with the elections. But given the claims and rhetoric from the candidates in the upcoming election, the new tagging feature will likely make it easier for users to do fact checks on their own. With the feature, Google will start tagging articles that it determines might contain fact checks. The company has also added a new option that publishers can use to indicate when they have a fact-checked article so it can be tagged appropriately, Richard Gingras, head of Google News, said in a blog post this week. The tagged articles will appear in the expanded story box on Google News. "Over the last several years, fact checking has come into its own," Gingras said.  Led by organizations like the International Fact Checking Network, rigorous fact checks are now conducted by more than 100 active sites," he said quoting a Duke University report.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   How the Internet Came of Age as a Campaign Tool in 2016 Election Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards YouTube Now Providing Support for High-Definition Video Cloud Native Computing Foundation Adds New Project, Grows Membership Microsoft Adds Kubernetes for Azure Cloud Container Orchestration                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Node.js Is Helping Developers Get the Most Out of JavaScript Microsoft Surface Devices Challenge Apple in Enterprise Strongholds Apple's New MacBook Pros Leave Analysts Wanting More Microsoft Releases Skype for Business Mac Client Microsoft Blasts Google for Early Disclosure of Windows Bug Comparing Microsoft's Surface Studio ...

Just the odd point separating the teams as the top; Guardiola and Koeman engaged in the sort of continental tactical battle we’ve sorely lacked for years; Arsene Wenger suddenly deciding the league is competitive enough to bother with; and goals flying in left, right and centre. Could this be the most exciting iteration of the Greatest League in the World ™ since football began in 1992?” It’s such a subjective thing and there’s no right or wrong answer, not even on Twitter.

The advancement could mark a major breakthrough in the development of AI, as the “differentiable neural computer” (DNC) can solve problems without any prior knowledge. The article on DNCs is #DeepMind's third @Nature paper in just over 18 months! Pretty unprecedented in computer science! #OptimizingScience— Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) October 12, 2016 Instead, the DNC learns to use its own memory to answer questions about complex data. In a study published in the journal Nature, the technology also demonstrated it can solve a block puzzle game using reinforcement learning.

The researchers demonstrated how the program can analyze a description of an arbitrary graph and answer questions about it. The authors of the study, Alexander Graves and Greg Wayne, also explained how it works in a blog post. via GIPHY “When we described the stations and lines of the London Underground, we could ask a DNC to answer questions like, ‘Starting at Bond street, and taking the Central line in a direction one stop, the Circle line in a direction for four stops, and the Jubilee line in a direction for two stops, at what stop do you wind up?’,” the researchers write. The DNC could also plan routes when asked questions like, “How do you get from Moorgate to Piccadilly Circus?” When confronted with a family tree, the program was able to answer questions that require complex deductions. Even though the scientists only told it parent, child, and sibling relationships, the DNC could figure out questions such as “Who is Freya’s maternal great uncle?” DeepMind was founded as an AI start-up in 2010 and Google bought the London-based company for £400m ($487.6m) in 2014. via GIPHY Artificial intelligence has long stirred people’s existential fears, inspiring numerous books, films and TV show.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Galaxy Note 7 alternatives for your broken, stylus-loving heart By John Hoff - October 15, 2016 11 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter There are no two ways about it, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is as dead as a doornail. Long live the big-screen, stylus-enabled alternative! Except, we all know that there really isn’t anything out there yet that will compare to the Note 7, is there? No, there isn’t. Admittedly, what we have in this list are poor comparisons to what the Note 7 could and should have been. Nevertheless, these should start getting your heart moving on in the right direction, especially if you are indeed brokenhearted by Samsung’s fire-y, ill-fated phablet. And at least in theory, these won’t explode. (What. Too soon?) Samsung Galaxy S7 edge If we’re talking about sheer likeness of experience and raw processing power, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is probably the closest we can get to the Galaxy Note 7, but just without that newfangled S-Pen. The S7 edge gives up a tiny bit of screen real estate – at 5.5-inches to the Note 7’s 5.7-inch display – but it hits you with the same QuadHD Super AMOLED quality and a slightly denser pixel count because of the smaller screen. Performance-wise, you get the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset (or Exynos 8890 for the international version), supported 4GB RAM, so there won’t be much in the way of performance difference. You’re just giving up screen real estate, the S-Pen, and the iris scanner. You’re getting a handier, more compact phone with almost the same software experience and some handsome edges. And it won’t explode. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 If you really can’t let go of the S-Pen because it has become a part of your daily work processes, then last year’s Galaxy Note 5 will also be a real option. Granted, the Exynos 7420 octa-core chipset won’t be as buttery smooth and as responsive as this year’s chipsets, but it’s no slouch either. It will give you that Galaxy Note feel you’re looking for, with slightly the same features – if only older. There are also a few software hacks you can do to get some of the Note 7’s features working on the Note 5, if you’re the kind who is comfortable tweaking software. This is the closest you can get, in terms of Note features and screen real estate. And then it also lacks that feature which has endeared the Note 7 to all of us, the exploding part. LG V20 If you’re going for screen real estate and computing power, and if it’s ok for you to let go of the S-Pen and Samsung’s TouchWiz interface, the LG V20 might also be something to consider. You’ll be getting the same Quad HD 5.7-inch display, but only in LCD and not in Samsung’s Super AMOLED technology (so the black color on the screen won’t be as deep). Given that, it’s powered by the same Snapdragon 820 chip and supported by 4GB RAM so there won’t be any noticeable differences in performance. You just have to start getting used to LG’s skin over Android – it’s not TouchWiz, but it’s classy in its own way. And the V20 debuts with Android Nougat out of the box, something that the Note 7 won’t have. You’ll be giving up the S-Pen features big time on this phone, but that might get your broken heart healing faster anyways. You’ll just have to wait when US mobile carriers start shipping this upcoming phone. Also, you would hope it doesn’t explode as well. Google Pixel XL So if we’re moving away from Samsung, TouchWiz, and the Note 7 in general, why not experiment with something that is decidedly as exciting as the Note 7 as well? We’re talking about Google’s newfangled Pixel smartphones – specifically the Google Pixel XL if we’re talking about screen real estate. Of course, the Pixel XL isn’t really a phablet-sized device with its 5.5-inch display, but it will be comparable to the Galaxy S7 edge. What you’re giving up in features, you’ll probably be getting in newer ones as well. People are really excited about how Google built its Android Nougat premium features around the Pixel smartphones, and the camera has already been benchmarked and declared as “the best camera ever to grace a smartphone”. Of course, there is the small issue of pricing – the Pixel XL will start at USD$769, cheaper than the Note 7’s USD$850 average price, but that’s only for the 32GB variant. Up the storage to 128GB and you’ll be spending around the same amount as when you bought your Note 7. All evidences point to the Google Pixel XL not exploding, so there is that as well. Honorable mentions We have to admit that apart from the phones mentioned above, pretty much nothing comes close in terms of build quality, features, and performance to the Galaxy Note 7. There are a lot of other phones that do not explode, though – and with feature sets that might warrant a look as well. The Xiaomi Mi 5 is an all glass affair – if you’re looking for that premium, glossy feel from Samsung phones. The catch is that while it may perform well, you’re looking at a 5.1-inch display – which is indeed tiny when compared to the Note 7. The OnePlus 3 is also a good option if you’re looking for performance, and you’ll definitely spend less of the refund money you got from returning your Note 7. The OnePlus 3 features a 5.5-inch display and some nice features that you might want to consider as well. The Huawei P9 Plus might also be a good option, if you’re into the whole dual camera module trend. It’s still not shipping at this point, but you might want to wait for this device, given its 5.5-inch screen, robust processor, and trendy camera. Lastly, the ZTE Axon 7 is a beefy smartphone with solid features and performance for a price definitely lower than most flagships. You’re talking about a Snapdragon 820-powered phone, 4GB RAM, and a 20MP camera that should give you better-than-average performance. Conclusion In the end, we know you’ll be looking for something that you can use on a daily basis and will not put you or your family in danger of explosion or not ground you from a flight because airport security will not let you on the plane with a phone likely to catch fire. Any Note 7 alternative will give up some features, either screen size, the S-Pen, or some other new feature. But the truth is we all have to move on from this debacle, and getting yourself settled on a new phone will help you get started on new daily driver processes. Choose one, and let’s start moving on from the Note 7, and hopefully manufacturers will learn from all the mistakes Samsung did on this phablet.

Mihir Balantrapu Comment   ·   print   ·   T  T   T+  ·   T- Tweet Twitter needs to look elsewhere for buyers. After reports that Twitter was giving itself up for a takeover, several potential bidders have since backed away from the deal. Twitter is among the more popular platforms if you want to air your current state of mind. This makes it a very lucrative platform, because everyone has a current state of mind, right? Well, financially speaking, not so much. >Twitter for sale >No one is buying Twitter >Twitter stock crashed 18% last night >another twitter exec leaves everything is fine— Gus (@guscraw) October 6, 2016 Its shares — or rather, its monetary popularity — has just dropped 5% after its last remaining suitor, Salesforce, categorically affirmed that it does not intend to buy it. Last remaining suitor, because other entities that were lined up to buy it, like Google (parented by Alphabet Inc.), Verizon, Microsoft, and even Disney, who had all hinted at the intention to acquire the 140-character news platform last month. Even Google, which is now moving into artificial intelligence which is heaviltyinto personal user information, has not come good with predictions that it was among the first in line to acquire Twitter's considerable social communications assets. Twitter's possible sale and Salesforce; https://t.co/5Rc6GY2M7y— TF Reviews (@btfrxyz) October 11, 2016 Even Apple is more focussed on its consumer products, and is not likely to make a pitch for a social network. Twitter, which went public in November 2013 has 313 million average monthly users, has reportedly struggled to generate a net profit for over 11 quarters now. Even advertisers are veering towards Facebook and Snapchat, which have eclipsed Twitter in terms of users. It has therefore lost over $2 million in market capitalisation. When it went public in 2013, it was worth $31 billion; now it is under $15 billion. Explains why it is looking to sell. Why did Salesforce suddenly withdraw its chip? According to Techcrunch, Salesforce's largest investor Fidelity Investments was against the deal. It reportedly tried to buy LinkedIn, but Microsoft beat it to it. No wonder salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff told the FT, "In this case, we have walked away. It [Twitter] wasn't the right fit for us."

In an interview the Financial Times, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said that Twitter “wasn’t the right fit for us.” This announcement likely comes as a big blow to Twitter, as it was reported that the company was eager to reach an agreement before the end of this month. When the talk about bids first surfaced, Verizon quickly stated that it wasn’t participating, while Google and Disney both walked away without making offers. There was a rumor that Apple was a potential buyer, but at this point it seems like that was hopeful thinking. The value of Twitter’s stock was reported to have dropped around 6% after the Salesforce statement was revealed on Friday, marking another blow to the social network that has been facing a constant struggle against a lack of user growth and consistent ways to make a profit. The reasons Benioff mentioned for Salesforce declining to make a bid included a difference in company culture, and a disagreement on the price. Twitter currently has an investors meeting schedule for October 27th to discuss earnings, so there’s a good chance we’ll hear more about what happened with the failed bids or what the next plans for an acquisition are.

 The tablets built into New York streets are getting a major software update Kif Leswing Oct. 15, 2016, 8:30 AM 3,072 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alana Kakoyinannis/Business Insider New York's municipal Wi-Fi network only launched in January of this year, but 10 months later, it already seems like a part of the cityscape, despite one high-profile setback. Over 600,000 people have signed up to use the Wi-Fi beacons, called Links, says Dan Doctoroff, CEO of Sidewalk Labs, and 4,000 new users are signing up per day. Sidewalk Labs is a subsidiary of Alphabet, the Google-led conglomerate. It's involved in Link by owning a substantial stake in Intersection, the company that operates Link NYC as part of a consortium. Sidewalk Labs and Intersection share an office in Hudson Yards, Manhattan. As of now, there are 367 of the connected monoliths installed on New York city streets, but the rate of growth should accelerate as more are installed and turned on, according to Intersection, the company responsible for deploying the Links.  "Digging trenches is not easy, getting permits from government is never easy," Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff told Business Insider. "What's really great is that the service Link provides people desperately need and want." Sidewalk Labs is an investor in Intersection, and Doctoroff is Intersection's chairman.  And before the end of the year, the Android tablets built into the kiosks will get a major software update, complete with a new interface designed specifically for the kiosks.  Living room on the streets The computer inside a Link wi-fi hotspot, on display at Sidewalk Labs' headquarters on the west side of Manhattan. Kif Leswing/Business Insider To many New Yorkers, the Link network is associated with quality-of-life issues that eventually forced Intersection, the company overseeing the network, to turn off the built-in web browser on the tablets. "The Wi-Fi kiosks in New York ... have also attracted people who linger for hours, sometimes drinking and doing drugs and, at times, boldly watching pornography on the sidewalks," the New York Times reported in September.  It was never about the porn, says Colin O'Donnell, Chief Innovation Officer of Intersection. It just made for good headlines. In fact, the Android tablets built into the Links included comprehensive adult content filters. "No requests to adult sites were being served," O'Donnell says.  The issue was instead that there were people who found the built-in tablets on the Links to be so useful that they would pull up a chair and sit in front of them for hours.  That's why Intersection turned off the web browser, O'Donnell says. Since the browser in the built-in tablet was turned off, Intersection has actually seen an increase in the number of people using the built-in tablets, but a decrease in the average time people are using them. Intersection saw a 96% drop in complaints about long-term browsing sessions after the tweak was made.  Getty "We never envisioned that browser to be used for long-term use. It was always designed to be transactional and to be honest it’s not fair when people hog the use of it, and so, we saw abuses of that, and we had to stop it,"  Intersection is planning to push out an update before the end of the year that redesigns the tablet interface, adding back some level of internet access. "It's going to be more widgets or card-based," O'Donnell says. “The next iteration will be more of a mix of applications and content." O'Donnell says that the new interface is going to be "Metro Style or Material Design," referring to the design language that Microsoft and Google have settled on. "It's not unfettered access to the internet, but it respects people's need for information," O'Donnell says.  An uncovered need A map of Links in NYC LinkNYC Shortly after Intersection announced that it was making changes to address the hogging issue, people around the city argued that it revealed that the Google-backed project was "never about serving the public in the first place." Not so, says O'Donnell. The fact that people were monopolizing certain links "uncovered a latent need for internet access for homeless people" and other vulnerable communities.  "We believe having access to broadband in today's society is really no different than having access to water and electricity," Doctoroff said. "Our mission, at the end of the day, is to give people access to fast connectivity, and on that measure thus far, we are doing extraordinarily well." Municipal Wi-Fi networks using Link technology should start spreading to other cities next year, says Intersection.  NOW WATCH: Here's how Donald Trump can function on barely any sleep — and why you shouldn't copy him Loading video...

HTC Bolt Leaks in Images Revealing a Metal Design GO The smartphone could run Android Nougat out of the box Oct 15, 2016 12:10 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  HTC was the manufacturer of Google’s two smartphones that were launched just a week ago, the Pixel and Pixel XL. HTC is also working on some upcoming smartphones, one of which is HTC Bolt. Information on the phone has been surfacing for some weeks now and Venture Beat has just come across pictures of the device. The smartphone does seem to resemble one of HTC’s previous flagships, the HTC 10, with its all-metal design and fingerprint scanner on the front. Still, the HTC Bolt appears to be larger than the HTC 10, featuring a 5.5-inch display with 1080p resolution. The HTC Bolt doesn’t appear to have a 3.5mm headphone jack, which might make it the first HTC smartphone to not include the widely used port. This also means that the smartphone will most likely come with a USB Type-C port and users would need to get compatible headphones. In addition, many smartphone makers, like Motorola and Apple, have ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack, which means that this could quickly become a trend on the smartphone market. HTC Bolt could run Android Nougat and have 3GB of RAM Rumors on the upcoming smartphone say that it could run Android Nougat with Sense 8.0 UI out of the box. In addition, the HTC Bolt might come with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable internal memory. It could also have HTC BoomSound speakers with dedicated amplifiers and digital sound processors, as well as proprietary software. BoomSound was first introduced on the HTC One and HTC One Mini. HTC Bolt could also come with a dual LED flash rear camera, but that remains to be seen. HTC Bolt could be released later this month in the US at Sprint and in several other markets around the world. More information on the upcoming smartphone will surely surface over the next few weeks.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #HTC#HTC Bolt#HTC 10#Android Nougat#Sense 8.0 UI subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Images of the upcoming HTC Bolt (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news HTC Bolt to Run Android Nougat and Sense 8.0 UI at Launch HTC Revenue Increased by 41.8% in September Verizon to Handle System Updates on Pixel Phones, While Google Security Updates HTC Working on Three Devices in the Ocean Series 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Andriod Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background 2 photos    HTC Bolt front and back view New Android APKs Navbar Apps APK: Updated November 13th, 17:48 GMT MiXplorer APK: Updated November 13th, 17:46 GMT Periscope APK: Updated November 13th, 17:43 GMT XDA Labs APK: Updated November 13th, 17:38 GMT Game Tools APK: Updated November 13th, 17:35 GMT SoundHound APK: Updated November 13th, 17:33 GMT Microsoft Classroom APK: Updated November 13th, 17:17 GMT Reader comments Samsung Announces Android 7.0 Nougat for the Galaxy S7/S7 edge more on: Samsung Galaxy S7 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

By India Ashok October 15, 2016 12:30 BST Five previously undisclosed zero day vulnerabilities were patched by Microsoft, four of which were found being actively exploited in the wild by malicious entitiesiStock While the world was preoccupied with the Yahoo hack and the cyberattacks revolving around the US elections as well as their possible connection to Russian interference, cyberspace experienced many onslaughts. Amid WikiLeaks' much publicised Podesta email dumps and the White House officially pointing the finger at Russia, a nuclear plant was hacked, several undisclosed zero days were attacked and patched and more such noteworthy incidences took place. Here are the Top 5 cybersecurity news that you may have missed in recent weeks:- Over 58 million customer records stolen in what may be the 9th largest data breach A hacker going by the pseudonym 0x2Taylor claimed responsibility of having hacked into an unsecured database run by US-based data storage firm Modern Business Systems (MBS). Over 58 million customer records were leaked online, however security researchers speculate that the hacker may be in possession of more data, which could be released in the future. According to breach notification site, haveibeenpwned.com, this may be the 9th largest data breach, however there has been no confirmation from MBS as of yet and the data leaked is yet to be verified by researchers, especially since the MongoDB operated database has since been secured by the firm. A nuclear power plant was disrupted by a malicious hack The director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, revealed that an unnamed nuclear power plant was targeted with a malicious cyberattack in the past two or three years. Declining to provide further information about the incident, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog told Reutersthat while the hack resulted in the nuclear plant being disrupted, it did not completely shut down the facility. "This actually happened and it caused some problems," Amano said. "This issue of cyber attacks on nuclear-related facilities or activities should be taken very seriously. We never know if we know everything or if it's the tip of the iceberg." Hacktivist group RedHack beat Turkey at its censorship game Turkey imposed a nationwide blockon prominent technology and cloud service providers such as Google, Microsoft and Dropbox, among others, in efforts to restrict the spread of leaked emails from high-ranking government officials. The leaked emails allegedly originated from Turkey's minister of energy and natural resources, Berat Albayrak, who is also the son-in-law of Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. However, according to a report by the Daily Dot, RedHack anticipated just such a move and uploaded the torrent file of the stolen data to GitHub. Despite Turkey's 18-hour long block on GitHub, the content uploaded by RedHack remained virtually undisturbed. Additionally, throughout the block, RedHat continued sharing the torrent file. Five undisclosed zero day vulnerabilities were patched by Microsoft Microsoft successfully patched five previously undisclosed zero day vulnerabilities, four of which were found being actively exploited in the wild by malicious entities. The zero days were found affecting Internet Explorer, Edge, Windows and Office products. Microsoft's latest security update also marked the first time that the tech giant issued out security updates for older Windows versions, including Windows 7 and 8, and Windows Server 2008 and 2012, as a comprehensive security and feature update. Botnet that facilitated the largest DDoS attack ever now freely available The Mirai botnet, which was responsible to facilitating the largest recorded DDoS attack and which took down security investigator Brian Krebs' website for weeks is now available freely for anyone to exploit. The source code to the Mirai botnet was released by a hacker going by the pseudonym 'Anna-senpai'. The hacker even posted a tutorial no how to set up the botnet on the popular online hacker community HackForums.net.

There she was last week in Nevada, amid the 70,000 dust covered hippies of the Burning Man festival, communing with the wilderness and soaking up the beats (well, as much as was possible from the comfort of the Google tent). There she is hanging on the yacht of Roman Abramovich, a friend of Russian premier Vladimir Putin, with whom Wendi has been frequently linked. In late summer, as the sky over Central Park crackled with lightening, Vogue pictured the world's most famous divorcee making dumplings for her friends in New York. More recently we glimpsed her hanging in Croatia with Ivanka Trump, another woman with a taste for diabolical super villains. It's been three years since Deng's marriage to Rupert Murdoch, the most powerful mogul in world media, ended, and the veil of mourning, if it ever existed, is long gone. Like any Instagram winner, she gives the careful impression of living her best life. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Over her shoulder there is still a certain amount of wreckage. Rupert may have remarried - to former Texan beauty queen and ex of Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall - but somehow the same media narrative of swiftly and glamorously moving on doesn't seem to have imbued his union. He and Jerry seemed to be sort of arthritically supporting each other in the various beach pap shots that emerged over the last few months. In the UK, particularly, the mockery of their union has continued unabated. In a post-Leveson world, laughing at the old tycoon seems more than fair game - after all he considered broken marriages and reeling divorcees to be headline fodder for over 30 years. Murdoch's surrogates have recently added to the impression of lingering hurt. Chris Mitchell, the former editor-in-chief of The Australian newspaper brought out a book two weeks ago in which he claimed that Murdoch had been "devastated" by Wendi's wandering eye and the rumoured relationship said to have been between her and Tony Blair. "He was clearly lonely and struggling to sleep at night for the first few months after the separation," Mitchell writes about Murdoch, with whom he worked closely. "He rang much more often than he had previously. And he was frank about his sleep problems, sore back and the hurt he was feeling about what was being said about Wendi and Tony Blair. "It was clear that my boss had been devastated by the closeness he found between his wife and his former friend." There had been rumours about affairs, particularly one that allegedly took place with Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google. Murdoch turned a blind eye to those. But the idea of his wife being with Blair hit him hard. The Australian billionaire's UK titles had played no small part in bringing the then-leader of the Labour party to power in Britain in the 1990s and Blair had become not only a valued friend but also the godfather of Grace, the older of Rupert and Wendi's two daughters. At a series of public events, Wendi became infatuated with Blair. In a note, published by Vanity Fair in 2014, she wrote in broken English: "Oh, s***, oh, s***. Whatever why I'm so so missing Tony. Because he is so so charming and his clothes are so good. He has such good body and he has really really good legs, butt ... And he is slim tall and good skin. Pierce (sic) blue eyes which I love. Love his eyes. Also I love his power on the stage ... and what else and what else and what else…" She later invited the former prime minister to spend time at the Murdoch ranch in Carmel Valley, California. Murdoch got wind of this and flew home. Vanity Fair claimed domestic staff told Murdoch that Deng had gone to the master bedroom, but "by the time they could tell her, Blair was looking for her, they found Blair walking into the master bedroom and closing the door behind him." A week after this discovery, Murdoch sent her divorce papers. The cat was out of the bag and slinking around the ankles of sundry journalists. Blair and Wendi have always denied that anything went on between them. It might comfort Rupert somewhat that Blair no longer seems like such a catch. His reputation as a statesman is now in tatters after the publication of the Chilcot Inquiry earlier this year. Meanwhile, the Blairs' property empire - 38 properties in all - is worth around £32m, with 36 of them in the name of Cherie or jointly with their children. Cherie also has her own property portfolio and her law firm Omnia Strategy, helps countries manage their political security risks - from Albania to Bahrain, Egypt and Nigeria. She has never commented on the situation with Wendi and Tony. Wendi and Rupert are said to be on friendly terms still, the terms of the divorce have been quietly taken care of in line with the pre-nuptial agreement which was signed by both. Under the terms of the settlement neither she nor her two daughters with Murdoch received voting rights in Newscorp but the daughters received shares equal to the other Murdoch children and will attain voting rights when they turn 30. From the wreckage of her marriage, Wendi also salvaged something her ex-husband will never enjoy: a certain, unlikely popularity and decades of life ahead. Perhaps most interestingly of all, she kept his name. A recent profile of her described her as "pushy", "heat-seeking" and like a moth to the flame of successful, talented men. She grew up with nothing in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, a particularly densely populated corner of China. "No electricity every day, no telephone, no TV, no refrigerator, no hot water. It was a boring life. I never had a toy. Not one doll, anything", she recalled in an interview earlier this year. "You didn't know you were poor. It's just the way it was. So to get anyone's attention you had to be smart." Wendi studied hard. She spent each summer reading the next year's textbooks. "My parents were tough, and I was never good enough." As a child she pored over pictures of the West, and was particularly mesmerised by a photo of Times Square. After school she began medical training in China, but soon dropped off and went to the States on a student visa. By then she had met an American businessman and his wife, Jake and Joyce Cherry, who offered to help her move - Joyce also taught Wendi English. The young Chinese student began an economics degree at the University of Southern California, working in a variety of menial jobs to pay her way. Somewhere along the way she also began an affair with Jake. Within a few months the Cherrys had divorced and Wendi and Jake had married. The marriage lasted four months but, crucially, Wendi got a Green Card. Little wonder perhaps that she would later be described as a 'legend to the burgeoning subset of upwardly mobile young Chinese women known as Shanghai Girls, who employ everything in their power to seduce Western businessmen and, ideally, to move out of the country." Wendi worked hard in the US and eventually earned a scholarship and an MBA from Yale Business School. During this period she met Bruce Churchill, who oversaw corporate development at Fox's Los Angeles branch, through a mutual friend. He gave her a job as a junior executive and she quickly segued into a more senior role at the company's Hong Kong office. Within a year, she had become a vice president. Again and again she proved herself to be a savvy and astute businesswoman. She led Murdoch's Chinese internet investments, totalling between £29m and £37m, and helped form business links with China for high-speed video and internet access. It was during this time that she found herself accompanying Murdoch to meetings in Shanghai and acting as his interpreter. He was by all accounts instantly smitten, and they were married on Murdoch's yacht, parked in New York Harbour, a few weeks after his divorce from Anna Murdoch (to whom he was married for 32 years) was finalised. For Rupert there was potentially more than a mere marriage on the line during this period. He was determined to crack China - it was almost an obsession - and was undergoing a sort of mid-life crisis. Wendi represented both his ambitions in Asia - she helped him court the region's super elite - and his desire for everlasting youth. For her the marriage meant an opportunity to live the dream of becoming an influential socialite - she was said to wield significant influence at Newscorp. The couple were constantly on the road and Wendi had to both make sure the yachts and houses looked fabulous and also play the role of glamorous consort. Their circle of friends soon included David Geffen, Larry Ellison, Bono, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. She became pregnant by IVF (she and Murdoch now have two teenage daughters - Grace and Chloe - who went on to attend Brearley, the exclusive private girls' school in Manhattan). Newsweek dubbed her "wonder Wendi". Her friends include Arianna Huffington and Diane von Furstenberg. She also became close to Deborra-Lee Furness (wife of the actor Hugh Jackman). She was always feisty and the moment, during the Leveson Inquiry, when she physically defended Rupert from a pie thrower, will live in the memory of all who saw it. There were also rumours that she had a temper. Still, it seemed not entirely unsurprising that the media decided to play matchmaker between Wendi and Vladimir Putin this year. If she can handle one of the world's most-powerful and most-hated men, then why not another, or so the thinking seemed to go (Putin divorced from his wife Lyudmila in 2014). Earlier this year Wendi scotched the rumours by claiming that she had never even met Putin. She did admit that she was single and looking.

A very comfortable win for Chelsea, who continue their recovery after that miserable night at Arsenal. There were a number of outstanding performances, most notably from Kante, Moses, Luiz, Pedro and Hazard. There’s plenty still to do but Antonio Conte is starting to shape the sort of team he wants. Leicester are still trying to work out what you do after the greatest Lord Mayor’s Show in the history of Lord Mayor’s Shows. Thanks for your company, bye.

They’ve also conceded 13 goals in four away games; last season they conceded 18 in 19. They have different priorities now, and it’s hard to criticise them for that. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.15am EDT 09:15 87 min “Pacy wingers with bad brains should all be converted into wing-backs,” says Phil Podolsky. “Not too late for Theo, is it? Oh.” He should have become a specialist substitute five years ago. I mean that; there’s so much glory to be had. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.12am EDT 09:12 85 min Drinkwater thrashes a 20-yard shot that deflects wide off Azpilicueta. Mahrez’s corner comes to nothing. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.10am EDT 09:10 82 min A double Chelsea substitution: Hazard and Moses off, Loftus-Check and Aina off. Moses received a lovely reception as he left; he’s come from nowhere to become a really important player in this system. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.08am EDT 09:08 GOAL! Chelsea 3-0 Leicester (Moses 80) Victor Moses seals the match with a wonderful goal! Moses, who has had a fine game at wing-back, came infield from the right and squared the ball to Chalobah on the edge of the area. Chalobah produced an ingenious first-time backheel put Moses clear, a moment of such dizzying brilliance that at first it was hard to be sure he meant it, and Moses passed it through Schmeichel from close range. Victor Moses celebrates after scoring the third goal with Marcos Alonso.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.01am EDT 09:01 75 min “I’ve been thinking for awhile now that the fall of Leicester and last year’s flattening of Chelsea was because of the extreme difficulty of a ‘once more unto the breach’ mentality of summoning up a title defence,” says Hubert O’Hearn. “Now I believe I know what’s missing. Neither side has or had that true, obsessive, midfield general along the lines of Souness, Roy Keane or the subtler yet no less dominant Frank Lampard. Patrick Vieira would count too, although Arsenal never had a successful title defence. The laissez-faire Yaya Toure or Cesc Fabgregas don’t quite get it done. Do you think I’m onto something?” I do agree that players like that are crucial in terms of maintaining and even increasing standards, though you need a lot more than just one player with that attitude. Defending a title is incredibly difficult; the fact three astonishing Arsenal teams couldn’t do it is the best example of that. Plus you don’t have to be a tough guy to have those standards; look at Xaviesta for example.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.00am EDT 09:00 73 min Morgan clears off the line to deny Kante a goal against his old club! Costa’s cross was only partially cleared by the outstretched leg of Schmeichel, and Kante’s instant follow-up would have gone in but for Morgan’s block. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.59am EDT 08:59 72 min Costa and Conte are having words about something or other. Costa wants to be subbed; Conte has reminded him, possibly via the medium of the four-letter word, who is the manager of Chelsea Football Club. Antonio Conte shouts instructions from the sidelines.

The change in this game has been enormous. They must have had a rare old rollocking at half-time. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.52am EDT 08:52 65 min Sky’s Rob Hawthorne has just apologised “if you heard any bad language from our pitch microphones”. Oh we heard it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.51am EDT 08:51 63 min Leicester, for all their improvement, haven’t really troubled Courtois as yet. They almost did then! Albrighton on the right played a stunning low cross towards Vardy on the six-yard line, and the stretching David Luiz diverted it onto his own post! Chelsea break, at which point the pitch mic captures somebody shouting “SCHMEICHEL YOU CAHNNNNNT!” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.48am EDT 08:48 62 min You know when you see your ex for the first time since they dumped you, and they look bloody hot?

If Leicester get one, and then bring on Mahrez, anything could happen. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.44am EDT 08:44 57 min Schmeichel keeps the game alive with a fine save from Moses. It came from a Leicester corner. Kante went on a ludicrous 70-yard surge down the left before playing a fine pass to find Moses in the centre. His crisp sidefooted shot was going in but Schmeichel got down excellently to his right. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.43am EDT 08:43 57 min “Unless one of the biggest come-backs against the run of play is about to happen, Leicester will have more defeats after week eight than they had in the whole league campaign last season,” says Admir Pajic. Wow, I bet that hasn’t happened for ages, eh? “That hasn’t happened since...well, last season when Chelsea suffered their fourth league in week eight at home to Southampton.

In fact it hit his chest rather than his arm anyway. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.40am EDT 08:40 54 min “Perhaps Leicester should have implemented a radical strategy to counter the inevitable difficult second album season (or non-pick up of free downloads) by having two managers,” writes Adrian de la Touche. Why not? It worked well for England in Slovakia. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.39am EDT 08:39 53 min Albrighton makes space on the edge of the area and drives over the bar. Leicester’s performance since half-time suggests the application of the hairdryer by Claudio Ranieri. They are playing with much greater vigour and purpose; they’re playing like Leicester, basically. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.37am EDT 08:37 51 min Azpilicueta is booked for sliding through Musa. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.36am EDT 08:36 48 min I completely missed a Chelsea appeal for a penalty after nine seconds of the second half, when Pedro’s shot hit the arm of Fuchs. And now Leicester have had a strong appeal turned down by Mr Andre Marriner. Schlupp went at Moses, who ran across him and bounced Schlupp to the ground. I think I’d have given a penalty there, though it wasn’t clear cut. Updated at 8.37am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.32am EDT 08:32 47 min “I’m just emailing so you’ll have someone to quote apart from Ian Copestake and Gary Naylor,” says Roy Allen. “What have Leicester lost? Hunger? Edge? Kanté? Underdog status? Element of surprise? All of the above?” Yep, all of those and more. It can’t be a coincidence that Leeds and Blackburn were also very strong at home and utterly abysmal away from home when defending their titles.

That was a stroll for Chelsea against a Leicester side who were somewhere between apathetic and pathetic. Who cares, they won the league last year, and that is worth a million 2-0 half-time deficits. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. Updated at 8.18am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.15am EDT 08:15 44 min “Is it safe to start up the patronising again with ‘Little Leicester’ like we did in the good old days of 2014?” asks Gary Naylor. “How about punctuating every conversation about football with “It’s all about money”, as 606 callers (and pundits) did in all shows from about 1995 until 2015? And is it too soon for a clumsy, but somehow apposite, “Jamie Vardy’s having a wake” song? See, that’s what the newscycle does these days - nostalgia is a matter of weeks not generations.” I told you all after the pre-season draw against Celtic: Ranieri should be sacked. He’s taken the club as far as he can. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.14am EDT 08:14 43 min Hazard, who is doing whatever he wants, zips infield and has a shot blocked on the edge of the area. If Chelsea can be bothered - and they have no midweek game to worry about - they could at least double this score in the second half. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.11am EDT 08:11 41 min Another swirling free-kick from Luiz is beaten away by Schmeichel. It was close to him but moving wickedly so he decided to punch rather than catch. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.10am EDT 08:10 39 min This is a decent spell for Leicester. Albrighton’s inswinging corner from the left is sliced back across his own area by Alonso at the far post, and David Luiz heads it behind for another corner. That one is punched clear by Courtois.

Credit: Edgar Su/Reuters Almost nothing can mute the vivid clamor of Bangkok. But in the wake of Thailand’s most-dreaded event — the death of the kingdom’s monarch — this raucous city feels remarkably hushed. Player utilities Popout Share download Listen to the Story. PRI.org <iframe frameborder="0"  src="http://www.pri.org/node/155271/embedded" height="75" width="100%"></iframe> There is little wailing or sobbing in the streets. This is Thailand, after all, where a Buddhist-driven culture values letting go over hysteria. But the city feels blanketed in grief. The subways are strangely quiet. Shopkeepers can be seen dabbing Kleenex at their eyes. At least three in four people are clad in black or muted colors. TV stations, by decree of the military government, have halted soap operas in favor of black-and-white films extolling the king’s greatness. Even Google’s Thai-language homepage has gone colorless. Life goes on. But in monochrome.   6:45 a.m. in Bangkok. First morning after the Thai king's death. Even the dawn joggers are clad in all-black exercise gear. A photo posted by @bkkapologist on Oct 13, 2016 at 4:55pm PDT King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 88, was the world’s longest-serving monarch. He passed on Oct. 13 after ruling for more than seven decades. From birth, generations of Thais were taught that the very essence of their Thai identity was embodied in this living human being. Bhumibol was widely regarded as a sacred father figure. His passing has plunged Thailand into a year of official mourning. “We feel indescribable pain,” said Kanchana Noktor, 34, a freelance worker. She was waiting to enter Thailand’s Grand Palace, a complex of glittering spires and jade Buddhas. Elaborate funeral rites, possibly lasting months, will be held within. Many thousands of mourners waited hours in the searing heat to catch a glimpse of the proceedings.   This is MAYBE one-third of the line to enter Thailand's Grand Palace right now. Definitely the longest queue I've seen. A video posted by @bkkapologist on Oct 13, 2016 at 9:04pm PDT Through tears, Kanchana explained that the death of her king — despite his well-publicized fight against organ failure — had registered as a shock. For years, public discussion of the king's death has been all but criminalized by the state. “I felt like he could have lived 120 years,” she said. “None of us have prepared our hearts. We can’t accept it.” People mourn as they offer condolences for Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej at the Grand Palace in Bangkok on Oct. 14, 2016.

The rumors claimed that companies such as Disney, Google, and Salesforce were interested suitors, although subsequent reports suggested that both Google and Disney were out, leaving Salesforce as the only known suitor. Unfortunately it looks like Salesforce is now out of the running as well, which means that unless there are more potential companies interested in acquiring Twitter that we do not know of, it looks like Twitter’s plans to sell themselves might be falling through. Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff confirmed the company’s plans in an interview with the Financial Times (paywall; via Reuters), According to Benioff, “In this case we’ve walked away. It wasn’t the right fit for us.” Benioff added that the price of the company and its culture were some of the reasons he felt that they weren’t a right fit. Salesforce has since confirmed Benioff’s comments, although Twitter themselves have declined to do so. So what does this mean for Twitter? We suppose it is business as usual, although recently we have heard that in a bid to try and stay more relevant and appeal to users, Twitter is expected to try and focus more on video content. The company is also said to be considering some short-term solutions, such as selling off assets that they deem are not central to its business. Filed in General. Read more about Twitter.

 Tech companies are laying underwater cables to prepare for increasing consumer demand BI Intelligence Oct. 14, 2016, 8:30 PM 2,643 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Apple is still struggling to keep fake apps out of the App Store Here's what a Trump presidency means for mobile apps and platforms What does Trump's presidency mean for the tech industry? This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google and Facebook are planning to begin laying a series of ultra-fast internet cables between Los Angeles and Hong Kong, as the two companies prepare for the impending hike in demand for bandwidth in Hong Kong. The Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) aims to accommodate the rapid growth in demand in the APAC region, one of the fastest-growing internet markets in the world. PLCN will likely become operational sometime in 2018. Providing fast and reliable infrastructure is integral for the two companies as they look to move their services further into Asia. Facebook and Google have struggled to maintain connections in Mainland China, according to The Wall Street Journal. The strict user-data regulations in the country have resulted in both companies’ websites being blocked. However, as an autonomous territory, Hong Kong sits outside of the firewall providing these companies and others like them an advantageous position to reach the market.  The news comes amid a flood of infrastructure activity by internet companies as they attempt to create more reliable and faster international connections, notes Gizmodo.Moreover, as mobile video becomes an increasingly important medium for consumers and advertisers alike, these cloud companies must ensure their networks can handle the greater bandwidth that video requires. Failure to do so could result in users looking to competitors. Consumer demand for mobile video is insatiable. For example, in May 2016, popular photo and video sharing app Snapchat revealed that it received roughly 10 billion daily video views, a 400% increase since May 2015. Moreover, mobile video already accounts for 43% of smartphone traffic, according to the 2016 Ericsson Mobility Report. Advertisers are following consumers' eyes. Sixty-two percent of US advertisers expect to increase mobile video ad spend in 2016, according to IAB. This is reflective of not only the uptick in consumer demand for video, but also the effectiveness of video, which results in higher conversion rates than other ad mediums, like banner ads or interstitials, notescomScore.  To receive stories like this one directly to your inbox every morning, sign up for the Apps and Platforms Briefing newsletter. Click here to learn more about how you can gain risk-free access today.

 Tesla should bail out on the SolarCity merger before it's too late Matthew DeBord Oct. 16, 2016, 3:43 PM 13,849 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk should be getting us to Mars, not bailing out SolarCity. SpaceX/YouTube In just a few months, Tesla has gone from being an upstart Silicon Valley car company on the verge of becoming a major automotive player with the introduction of it's $30,000, mass-market Model 3 and its 373,000 pre-orders to being a budding conglomerate that's about to acquire a struggling solar-panel leasing company to the tune of $2.6 billion. The SolarCity deal, set to be voted on by shareholders next month, will also entail the absorption of $2.5 billion in debt, weighing down Tesla's balance sheet at exactly the wrong time. Make no mistake, this is a SolarCity bailout, and the deal is complicated by the fact that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the largest shareholder of both companies — and that Musk's cousin is SolarCity's CEO. Since the beginning of the year, SolarCity shares have plummeted by more than 50%, and the solar-panel leasing-and-installing has over a billion in debt payments due by the end of 2016. The Master Plan Ouch. Google Finance For Musk, SolarCity is a critical piece of his Master Plan to accelerate humanity's departure from the fossil-fuels era, debt be damned. Tesla vehicles produce no carbon emissions, although much of the electricity that powers them comes from burning coal. Solar is the fix on that front: clean energy drawn from Musk's favorite source, that giant fusion reactor in the sky, the Sun.  As an aside to this discussion, Musk's third company, SpaceX, will provide the escape hatch if everything goes horribly wrong: we'll use Mars colonies to "back up the biosphere," as he puts it, and SpaceX rockets will get us there. It all fits together beautifully, and in fact I think Musk should step down as Tesla CEO so that he can devote himself entirely to SpaceX. But unfortunately, if the car industry is tough and getting people to Mars currently insurmountable, then the solar business is really just terrible. Yes, it has been improving steadily for a decade, and SolarCity's leasing model is innovative. However, the industry repels technical innovation — controversial and failed Solyndra had a breakthrough technology that was completely overwhelmed by the commodity nature of solar-panel manufacturing when China flooded the market in 2011, sending Solyndra into bankruptcy. And customers need to sign on to an abstract, environment-saving agenda that may not have much impact on their household bottom lines for years. Now Musk wants to yoke electric cars, solar power, energy storage, and possibly ride sharing into one big Tesla party, all while keeping SpaceX on pace to send humans to Mars in a decade. Stop before it's too late. Thomson Reuters Tesla and SpaceX win while SolarCity loses As someone who often looks at the Sun and looks at his roof and considers the energy cost-savings possibilities, I'm naturally sympathetic with Musk's ambitions. But where Tesla and SpaceX are concerned, now isn't the time for the art of the possible. SolarCity is going to be a huge drag on Tesla ability to push electric vehicles past a tipping point: if Tesla can hit Musk's targets, it will be selling more EVs every year by 2018 than are currently on US roads in total. SolarCity has clearly become a capital-destroying machine. It's market cap is worth less than its debt, and Tesla is paying a half a billion premium to assume those liabilities. Even the most swashbuckling private-equity buccaneer would conclude this deal looks pretty lousy. It's also one of the largest deals being done right now by an automaker. General Motors and Ford have been buying companies. But they haven't come anywhere near what Tesla will be coughing up for the right to inhale SolarCity. Their acquisitions also seem strategic — GM buying Cruise Automation for self-driving tech, while Ford bought Chariot, a Bay Area bus service that's a big buyer of Ford vans. They aren't fooling around with purchasing oil exploration or gas-refining operations. Of course, it's Musk's job to think far, far ahead, and we should commend him for it. There's not more visionary figure in American business at the moment — and there may never have been, in US history. But that doesn't mean he's incapable of presiding over a merger that could do horrible damage to Tesla, setting the automaker back years and putting and end to its impressive run. I don't know if Tesla can call off the SolarCity deal before it's too late. But if it can, it should.   SEE ALSO: It's time for Elon Musk to think about turning the Tesla CEO job over to someone else NOW WATCH: A 13-year-old kid explains why Tesla is the best car Loading video...
