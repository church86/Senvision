However, this new update seems to have a glaring bug that is causing fingerprint scanners to not function at all. This problem is not limited to one particular handset and instead seems to be widespread for both Nexus users and Pixel users as reported by Android Police. The affected Pixel and Nexus users have taken to Google product forums detailing the problem that they are facing after installing Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA (Over-the-air) update. The product forums hint that the problem has hit Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. One thing to note here is that the fingerprint sensors are not letting users unlock their devices but the swipe down gesture to access notifications using the sensor is still working without any problem. The users have tried to delete fingerprints from the smartphone database to start from scratch but that also has not worked out. This comes just days after Nexus 6P users of Google’s Android Beta program started receiving the final Android 7.1.2 update after being stuck on Android Nougat 7.1.2 beta while regular users received their stable update. This comes after the possible hints that Google maybe getting sued for the early shutdowns and bootloop issues that have plagued Nexus 6P.

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail? David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/16 1:01pm PDTApr 16, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 104 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares215 Applications Polls Google Inbox and Gmail have been competing for our hearts (and email) for some time now, and it doesn't seem like Google is slowing down development of either [great] app. Clearly, Gmail is for some, and Inbox for others - so which one are you? I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

The latest update that bumps the app to version 2.13 bring video stabilization feature. You can access video stabilization in the Videos tab from the Albums page. A new “Stabilize” option is seen next to the “Rotate” button if you tap on a video and hit the edit icon. Tapping it will process your video to make it less shaky. A progress bar shows you how stabilization is progressing and when it’s finished, the “Stabilize” button turns blue. Stabilization has only been implemented on Photos for Android. It’s unknown if Google has plans to push it to iOS. Google has been updating Photos from time to time with new features improved photo sharing, animations from videos, theme based movies and more.

It works as intended and so far feedback seems to be mostly positive. That being said if you’re hoping for a newer version of Google WiFi, you’ll be pleased to learn that Google could be working on a second-generation Google WiFi thanks to a recent sighting at the FCC. The specs of the newer version appear to be similar to last year’s model with dual-band support, and if anything it sounds like it could be a more pared down version. Android Police has noted that the version spotted at the FCC does not have support for ZigBee protocol which is usually associated with IoT and home automation, which means that maybe this could be a cheaper and simpler version for users who just want WiFi and don’t really want all the other features. It will however retain the same ports, such as dual ethernet ports and a power connection. No word on when this particular model will be revealed, but it is possible with Google I/O 2017 coming up that we could learn more about it then. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about FCC and Google.

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail? David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/16 1:01pm PDTApr 16, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 104 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares215 Applications Polls Google Inbox and Gmail have been competing for our hearts (and email) for some time now, and it doesn't seem like Google is slowing down development of either [great] app. Clearly, Gmail is for some, and Inbox for others - so which one are you? I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

A new software update can be great for your smartphone, as it brings with it security patches and resolves bugs, as well as brings in new features that enhance the performance of the smartphone. However, the case of the latest Nougat 7.1.2 update for Google Pixel and Google Nexus phones, it is better to wait for some time and hold off the update. Why Not Update The latest update to Android Nougat, 7.1.2 version is said to break the core feature of the Google Pixel and Nexus smartphones, namely the fingerprint sensor of the phone. There are several reports on the product forums of the Google Pixel and the Google Nexus, that the latest update cripples the feature on the Pixel, the Pixel XL, the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P, making the fingerprint sensor feature useless. Unlocking Crippled Users of the phone have reported that after the update to Nougat 7.1.2 version, they have not been able to unlock the phones using the fingerprint sensor located at the rear of the smartphone. The new update also does not allow users to register fresh fingerprints and deleting the old fingerprints also does not work or solve the problem. Swipe Gestures However,, the swiping down gesture for pulling down the notifications shade is still operating well even after the update has been installed on the Google Pixel and the Google Nexus phones. This shows that the sensor is not totally bricked due to the new update 7.1.2. It is possible that there is a bug that was overlooked while making this update. Fixing Things It is not known whether Google will offer a fix for the problem and restore the functionality of the fingerprint sensor for the smartphones. It is also not known whether the problem is isolated to a few devices or whether it is a widespread one. The fingerprint sensor on the smartphone is one of the safest ways of locking down the Google Pixel or the Google Nexus phones. The feature is also very important for authenticating payments made through Android Pay. Protecting Your Identity For users who have already updated their Pixel or Nexus phones to the latest Android Nougat 7.1.2 version, resulting in the fingerprint sensor issue, it is advised that they use a strong passcode. It is better to ditch the simple four-digit pin and opt for some complex pattern in order to protect the smartphone. If you have not yet updated the device and receive a prompt requesting the 7.1.2 update, don’t be in a hurry to do so. Good News However, there is some good news, as the community manager of Pixel seems to be aware of the issue and they are attempting to obtain as much of information as possible. They are attempting to find the cause of the issue, so it will probably be identified and a fix will be offered in the form of another update very soon.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 87 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine.

Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named.

We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving. The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling.

By: Shilpa Updated: Monday, April 17, 2017, 9:33 [IST] If you are a Pixel fan, here is a great news for you. Google Pixel 2 is likely to be released this October and you can buy it immediately once it is made available in the market. Though the release date is not yet confirmed, a Google executive made sure that the second-generation flagship phones Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL will make a debut this year. The first generation flagship phones from Google were unveiled on October last year. So, there is a high chance that the company is going to release the next generation phones at the same time. Quite a lot of rumors and leaks are flowing online regarding the designs and specs of upcoming flagship devices. It looks like these phones are surely going to grab the attention of many buyers. Among all those rumors, this release date has become the interesting one for those who are looking forward to buying this smartphone. Not just this, even Rick Osterloh, Google's senior vice president of hardware, once stated that for the release of premium-grade devices, they always look to follow an annual release cycle. Also Read: Android 7.1.2 upgrade breaks fingerprint scanner on some Pixel and Nexus phones So, the probability of releasing Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL on October is indeed high. Though it is not possible to put together all the leaks and rumors to visualize the final design of the device, some do say that they may come with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset and offer the best features when compared to other smartphones released this year. There is also a higher chance of providing an excellent camera with waterproof feature. They are expected to have around GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. There were few rumors saying that the search giant has made a deal with LG for flexible OLED panels. So, some are assuming that these two devices may feature a curved OLED design. Also Read: Google Pixel series smartphones get Wi-Fi calling on Reliance Jio Networks But Pixel fans have reacted negatively to this news, so we have to wait and see whether the company is going to ditch this plan or having some other plan in terms of design. The price of these phones are not revealed yet, but all are expecting them to be a higher budget smartphone. One just has to wait few more months to get this device in their hand and review it by themselves.

Normangee Star Finance Market Industry Companies People Contacts About Our staff Contacts Terms of use Privacy New Burger King Ad Triggered Google Home Speakers – Until Google Stopped It 17.04.2017 Madeline Patrick 0 Comment By the end, however, the person in the ad says the phrase “OK Google, what is the Whopper burger”, which is primed to trigger any android device to start the search without their user’s permission”. The invasive 15-second ad, released on Wednesday (12 April), featured a man in a Burger King uniform holding up the sandwich and explaining that 15 seconds is “not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich”. The actor then motioned the camera to come closer, and said “Okay Google, what is the Whopper Burger?” Burger King’s tactic, while novel, raised eyebrows, particularly as more Americans use smart speakers at home, a trend led by Amazon’s Echo device and its virtual assistant, Alexa. The advertisement eliciting a response from Google devices was short-lived, however, as they stopped responding to the advert a few hours after it was launched. Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International, did not collaborate with Google or Wikipedia on the marketing campaign. The Google stunt could renew concerns about whether voice-activated technology has unintended consequences. “Burger King saw an opportunity to do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices”, a Burger King representative told Reuters. Android phones also don’t have “Ok Google” enabled by default, giving Burger King a smaller target area. Last time, in a 2017 Super Bowl ad, it was Google itself. Burger King president José Cil said in an interview prior as the campaign went to air that the company chose to pursue a new avenue of conveying “a story about our product”. “What is the Whopper burger?” Burger King did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Verge alleges this could be the work of Burger King’s marketing chief, Fernando Machado, but the Wikipedia entry has since reverted to old, as would always be the way after evidence of marketing emerges. In January, a California TV news reporter said “Alexa, order me a dollhouse” live on air, prompting Amazon Echo devices to awaken and attempt to buy dollhouses for their owners. We can only assume that in using the word “guests” he also means the millions of people with compatible devices that wouldn’t choose to eat a Whopper for said King’s ransom. “You don’t want to create a situation where consumers are developing resentment”. ← Russia loses Trump’s affection to China Hope, Healing at Vigils for San Bernardino School Shooting Victims → Recent Posts Mars spacecraft’s first missions face delays, NASA says Pence visits DMZ, sees North Korea’s failed missile test as ‘provocation’ Horner calls for T-wing ban after Verstappen/Bottas incident Sun Banned After Ross Barkley Article Surfaced Galaxy S8’s Bixby will have a confusing, convoluted rollout Copyright © 2017 Normangee Star.

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 104 Share on Facebook 68 Share on Twitter Total Shares203 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Đức Thành I guess you missed the part where I said 6 smart home devices weren't any where near enough. Bring me 16 and we're talking. :D Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library. Paul Quinn I can access a single song, an album, any of my playlists, or a Google Music Playlist. I can access music from my library or from Play Music's entire catalog. I am subscribed to Google Play Music. It's possible you are seeing this if you do not have a subscription. However, you should be able to access Google's curated lists. Michael I do have the subscription. I find this really odd. Can you verify you are able to play a song that exists only in your library and not available from Play Music? How did you ask for it to be played? I have a song in my library called Alligator.MP3 as well as many others and she cannot play it. There is an entire thread on this feature not being available so I would really appreciate it if you can double check. Thanks https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/googlehome/zC9dUi3FUsk/3W6KPacnAgAJ Paul Quinn I stand corrected! It is difficult to find songs only in my library and not in GP's library but I found a couple and it will not play them on the Home. That link in the product forum has an answer that says it should work. Am I reading that wrong? It's marked as "Best Answer." Michael Well, it should work if/when Google supports it.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Information Technology Burger King advert sabotaged on Wikipedia Published April 17, 2017April 17, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 A Burger King TV advert which was designed to activate Google Home smart speakers and some Android phones to describe its Whopper burgers has been hijacked by members of the public. The ad triggered the devices to read out information about the burgers from online encyclopaedia Wikipedia. However, somebody edited Wikipedia to describe the Whopper as the “worst hamburger product” and another added cyanide to the list of ingredients. The BBC understands the ad was blocked. Google did not publicly confirm this, saying only that it had “no involvement” in the campaign. But Burger King confirmed to the BBC that after the first iteration of the ad was blocked, it ran a tweaked version on the United States TV. According to a Burger King spokeswoman, the new ad was revoiced using a “different intonation” that bypassed the ban. In the 15-second advert, a Burger King employee asks “OK, Google. What is the Whopper burger?” The stunt has put Wikipedia in the spotlight after reports that Burger King’s own marketing team edited the Whopper page shortly before the ad campaign. The history of the page shows that changes were made on April 4 by Burger King Corporation. It edited the description of the product to include the lines “America’s favourite burger” and “100 per cent beef with no preservatives”. This change was quickly re-edited back to the original version. Wikipedia has not responded to requests for comment. Whether Burger King expected users to go on to make their own, less flattering edits is unclear but Emily Tan, technology editor at marketing news website Campaign, thinks it might have been aware such a reaction was likely.

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail?

I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Photo/Facebook Authorities have arrested a man suspected of killing Vanessa Marcotte, a 27-year-old Google employee who went out for a jog one afternoon and never came back. Angelo Colon-Ortiz, 31, has been charged with aggravated assault and battery and assault with attempt to rape, Worcester County District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr. announced Saturday. Early told reporters during a news conference that a murder charge is expected to be filed, according to Washington Post. "We got him," Early told reporters, according to the Associated Press. "We're very comfortable that we've got Vanessa Marcotte's killer." The arrest comes eight months after Marcotte's body was found about half a mile from her mother's house in Princeton, Massachusetts, where she was visiting for the weekend. The health-care account manager for Google was last seen about 1 pm on August 7. Massachusetts State Police K-9 teams discovered her body in a wooded area later that night, the Boston Globe reported. Investigators have received more than 1,300 tips from the public, but a break in the case happened after a state police trooper spotted a dark sport-utility vehicle driven by a man who matched the suspect's description, according to the district attorney's office. Continued below. Related Content DA announces arrest in murder of the Google executive jogger US police hunting gunman who shot and killed elderly man live on Facebook Cold case: Murder victim Ellen Mouat buried after 90 years The trooper wrote the license plate number on his hand and later tracked down the man's address. The trooper went to the man's home in Worcester, Massachusetts, not far from Princeton. There, Colon-Ortiz provided the officer with a DNA sample, the district attorney's office said. The DNA matched a sample taken from Marcotte's hands. Police believe that Marcotte fought her attacker, scratching his face, neck and arms, the AP reported. "It's through her determined fight and her efforts that we obtained the DNA of her killer," Early told reporters. Colon-Ortiz is being held on a $10 million bail and will have his first court hearing on Tuesday. Numerous local outlets - including the Boston Globe, the Telegram and Gazette and Boston's ABC affiliate - cited police sources as saying there are indications that Marcotte's body was burned. Marcotte's Instagram feed depicted someone who loved the New England Patriots, Boston and the beach. She died about a year and a half after she started a job at Google in New York. A Google spokesman had confirmed Marcotte's employment in an emailed statement to The Washington Post. "Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work, and love of Boston sports," the statement said. "We are deeply shocked and saddened and our thoughts are with her family and friends." According to her LinkedIn profile, Marcotte graduated from Boston University in 2011, stayed in the Boston area for several years and worked at WordStream, an online advertising company, and Vistaprint. - Washington Post By Amy Wang, Kristine Phillips Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Tank Edwards: Dedicated cricketing servant Tony 'Tank' Edwards has committed his life to the development of cricket.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to outside ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Today's speaker challenged my expectations of the internet and of corporate behavior and stimulated good office discussion." --March 2017 "I dislike most presentations. This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, April 26, 2017: American Spies: Jennifer Granick on U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: American Spies: U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Intelligence agencies in the U.S. (aka the American Spies) are exceedingly aggressive, pushing and sometimes bursting through the technological, legal and political boundaries of lawful surveillance. Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

In the UK, 8 out of 10 homes host a range of microphones, cameras and motion detectors. They help users secure their homes, find lost items, assist with cleaning, keep an eye out for accidents and falls, and a hundred other everyday tasks. They're integrated so seamlessly into daily life that they're considered indispensable – and they're cheap. Of course, consumption habits ranging from entertainment, clothing and food are not only known, but anticipated by intelligent systems. These habits are also owned, captured, analyzed and used by the corporations that run them. Interestingly, just a few decades ago in the 1990s, the UK’s introduction of Closed Caption TV (CCTV) met with significant public outcry over concerns of privacy abuses. Yet now, less than half a century later, we’ve not only abandoned such talks: we’ve opted in to 24/7 surveillance of our homes. In our May 10 “future retrospective,” we’ll look at how we - in 2027 - became so collectively compliant to others owning data about our personal habits and lives. What factors led to us to give so much of our lives to corporations, with so little transparency or accountability? Why were we more open to private surveillance than public surveillance? And when we return to 2017, what can we learn from this evolution to map a different future? Host: Sarah Allen Speaker: Adrian Hon Since 2007, Adrian has overseen the creation of all of Six to Start’s main projects, including Zombies, Run!, We Tell Stories, and Smokescreen, and its research and development projects with clients including Disney Imagineering, the British Museum, and Microsoft.

But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team.

Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News. Host: Doug Turner Deck Questions: Submit questions for Deanna during the event on IRC #AirMozilla.

Larger companies that embrace this approach (examples include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Airbnb and Dropbox) use creativity, analytical thinking, and social metrics to gain product exposure and grow their market share quickly. Speaker: Hiten Shah is cofounder and president of analytics companies KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg; he also advises startups. Host: Jascha Kaykas-Wolff Deck Questions: Submit your questions for Hiten in advance here, or during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. July 23, 2015: Rapid Prototyping with Tom Chi, GoogleX Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, July 23 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Tom Chi has worked in disciplines ranging from astrophysical research to Fortune 500 consulting to developing new hardware and software (web & client) products and services. He’s worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo! Answers from 0 to 90 million users). He also co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge projects including the autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons in the stratosphere that provide Internet access. Topic: Tom will talk about his approach to rapid prototyping using 'native' materials like paper and foam core to create and test experiences. Using this method, he has led teams to work more effectively and quickly, building state of the art (see above for examples) products as part of an ongoing innovation process. Host: Josh Carpenter Deck Workshop adapted from Tom's talk, from Mozilla Learning Network Questions: Submit your questions for Tom in advance here. May 21, 2015: Onboarding and Team Debt with Kate Heddleston Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 21 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Kate Heddleston, a software engineer in San Francisco, does a lot of speaking on the people-dimensions of software development and engineering management best practices. Her focus is on how software gets made, as well as on what it does. Topic: Kate shares her thoughts on the topic of onboarding new hires - what it takes to do that well, particularly in an engineering environment - and the 'team debt' that results when we do it poorly. Kate also shared some of the fairly immediate things individual teams can do to reduce the debt. Deck. Questions submitted to Kate in advance are here.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 133 Plus 1 on G+ 291 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares505 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 3 [Deal Alert] Staples has the Lenovo ThinkPad Chromebook 11e for $140 ($210 off) 2017/04/16 1:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] The first episode of Doctor Who season 10, plus the first episode of Class (a spinoff), are free on Google Play 2017/04/16 8:33am PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Once again, Google has failed to produce one of their famed “Google Doodles” to be featured on the Google main page to honor the Easter holiday. Google Doodles replace the typical graphic that Google features on their page displaying their company’s name with a clever graphic honoring a holiday or special event. Some are just a cute or interesting rendering that changes the letters to be in some way relevant to the special day in question, but some are quite ambitious and feature animations or even games for the user to participate in. Google has an archive of the Doodles for users to observe and interact with them. Some, like the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games, were interactive and honored the Olympics in Rio. Others, like the recent April 8 Doodle in honor of Mary Pickford’s birthday, are an artistic re-creation of the Google logo that doubles as a featured image of an important holiday, birthday, or special event. The Doodles serve the important purpose of letting everyone who uses the search engine know of an important event or holiday, and also symbolize cultural solidarity by unifying all Google users under a common Doodle. People can click on the Doodle and learn more about the holiday or person featured in the graphic. Wait, the last time Google had an "Easter" doodle was 17 years ago? https://t.co/Fqbqs004Hy pic.twitter.com/IaAs8iD798 — Gab: All Are Welcome (@getongab) April 16, 2017 But now, for the 17th year in a row, Google has snubbed the Easter holiday by failing to feature even a simple graphic to acknowledge the holiday. Google featured an Easter Doodle only once, in 2000, two years after the company started in 1998. Since then, when it comes to Easter, Google has been consistently and conspicuously silent. Google is not consistent when it comes to behaving in an areligious manner, either. Their distinctions do not seem to be based on whether the holiday is religious or not. In other words, Easter is not omitted as a Google Doodle because of its origins as a religious holiday — Google is not consistent because it features other important holidays from non-Christian religions as Google Doodles. For example, Google celebrates the Jewish festival of Tu B’av every year. Google also celebrates the Hindu festival, Holi. And Google has an entire subpage dedicated to the Islamic festival of Ramadan. Easter is resoundingly and consistently snubbed. Google on Ramadan vs Google on Easter pic.twitter.com/ZbbUK20rhz — Aleph (@woke8yearold) April 16, 2017 Easter is an important Christian holiday, although millions of people observe it in a non-religious manner. Christians believe that Easter celebrates the day that Christ rose from the dead after his Crucifixion. Easter is celebrated by at least a billion people all over the world. Therefore, the lack of an Easter Doodle doesn’t go unnoticed. A few years ago, Google published an explanation for why they routinely snub Easter. “Thank you everyone for your feedback. We enjoy celebrating holidays at Google but, as you may imagine, it can be difficult for us to choose which events to highlight on our site each year.” Critics point out that this isn’t much of an explanation. Tom Blumer of Newsbusters, a site that aims to expose and combat liberal media bias, translated Google’s explanation as follows. “You bunch of whiners, we put up an Easter doodle 15 years ago (now 16). What are you complaining about?” He went on to say that Google routinely snubbing Easter seems intentional, since it is such a large and culturally important holiday for Christians everywhere. “Yes, this is a ‘cultural blind spot’ that looks more and more with each passing year like a deliberate in-your-face omission.” Instapundit’s Ed Driscoll said that you only have to notice that there’s no Easter Doodle to understand why Google omits it compared to other holidays. Why do you think Google refuses to acknowledge Easter?

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail? David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/16 1:01pm PDTApr 16, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 104 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares215 Applications Polls Google Inbox and Gmail have been competing for our hearts (and email) for some time now, and it doesn't seem like Google is slowing down development of either [great] app. Clearly, Gmail is for some, and Inbox for others - so which one are you? I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Screens and Pixel 2 speculation. Already Google is entertaining rumors of its next flagship with three code names floating about. Meanwhile LG and Samsung are making headlines bringing beautiful screens and ridiculous screen-to-bezel ratios to their latest releases. Add to that LG seems to be working with Google on the Pixel. So, it got us to thinking about the Pixel and the screen. The Pixel has something of an identity problem these days. When the Pixel debuted, it was the only phone sporting Google Assistant. These days, many phones have the Assistant which eliminates a trump card from the Google flagship. What else could set it apart from the rest of the field? Screen tech is one area where Google could make a splash, and the way we see things here at Pocketnow, that screen could take one of three configurations, so we wanted to get your take on it. Flat is fine First, and most obvious, is the flat screen. The LG G6 follows this model and looks gorgeous. This is obviously the easiest screen to take on, but it might make the phone a little boring. On the other hand, if no other manufacturing techniques are needed to develop this kind of experience, then it could be called a win. The flat screen is good enough for the G6, so why make waves with something new? Well, Google seems to want something fancy in the Pixel 2 (or 3 depending on the rumor you believe). Curved OLEDs you say? Well, what kind of curves? At first glance, one might think an Infinity Display-like screen might be possible. After all, Samsung did it with all the sexy built in. Google could do worse than to copy that kind of design language. The dual edge displays offer a bare-minimum bezel and a sleek look that’s almost impossible to ignore. There’s a lot of potential in a curved screen like that you’ll find on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Dual edges like that could also allow for future refreshes of Android to take advantage of side panels, etc. Total speculation on my part by the way. Flex those muscles But there is another possibility. Remember the LG G Flex? Is the former butt-shaped phone so far removed from memory that Google might be thinking about making a comeback? The LG G Flex, much like the G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ had the unique ability to make a big phone feel smaller with a slight concave curve. It brings the top of the phone closer to your hand and gives you a cinematic feel when consuming media. Combining the concave curve of a phone, with the current minimal bezel trend could make for a very compelling device indeed. Plus, it would make the Pixel unique among its competitors, which is what Google needs. Google has gone all in on the Pixel line of phones with aggressive marketing campaigns across the board. Clearly Google is in this for the long haul. But setting its phone apart from the rest of the field would help it grow into the respectable brand it is trying to be. The Pixel was an ok start – personally I think it’s not all that attractive, but adding something like a curved screen could elevate it to a new level. Maybe give it a year Having said that, we may have already missed the boat on the next Pixel. The Pixel 3 might be our best bet, especially if LG ultimately wins the contract. Phones are not designed overnight. It’s a somewhat extended process – especially if you’re introducing a new design element like a curved screen. We still have a good six months before we realistically need to see a new generation of Pixel, but six months is a super short time for a development process. Given the troubles that Google had with its first-generation product, I’m not so sure Google wants to tap dance on a landmine like that. But for the Pixel 3, all bets are off. Would you like to see a curved or edged screen on a Google flagship? Do you think Google would be better off playing it safe and focusing on the “fast updates” promise? Comment about it down below. Who knows? Maybe Google is listening. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

The Android 7.1.2 Nougat update comes with 25.4MB in size, which makes sense since a device is not even going up a version number. The "Bisto" codename was found among device categories including Android TV, Google Home, Android Wear, a Google Pixel, and the general category of "phone", as per a report by Android Police. Some even reported that after upgrading to this version, they were not able to see an option for fingerprint unlocking in device's setting menu. So, if you got a Pixel or Pixel XL and update with 7.1.2, you may or may not be affected by this flaw. Still, it is not clear what exactly caused this problem but everyone is expecting this issue to be solved as soon as possible. "Although Google has assigned the issue in its tracker, the problem has been given low priority and there is no indication of an incoming fix". For the time being, it's unclear if this is a widespread issue or something isolated. The feature is also very important for authenticating payments made through Android Pay. Google also posted on its Pixel User Community forum about this issue, and true enough, there were Pixel owners who have experienced their fingerprint sensors not working after the same update. It is better to ditch the simple four-digit pin and opt for some complex pattern in order to protect the smartphone.

Sign up By Janna Dela Cruz , Christian Post Contributor Apr 16, 2017 | 12:00 PM x Google is not one to be left behind by its competition in the mobile scene. Reports have it that its next flagship, the Google Pixel 2, is getting a curved display. (Photo: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach)The Google Pixel phone is displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California. The software giant is looking to enlist LG Display to make that happen. According to Electronic Times, Google is setting aside $880 million for a large supply of flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays to be used on the Google Pixel 2. Unfortunately, although Google has this all planned out for the Google Pixel 2, it will ultimately come down to LG, which is yet to sign on to the lucrative deal. According to Forbes, the company might also be waiting on Apple, who is expected to match, if not, top that deal as it prepares for the production of the iPhone 8, which is also expected to make use of flexible OLED displays. It is unclear what Google has planned should they fail to strike a deal with LG. The abovementioned site, however, believes that the company has something up its sleeves. The bigger news is that the Google Pixel 2 might actually be sporting a curved display when it sees the light of day presumably later this year. Flexible OLED displays are the ones used on the Samsung Galaxy S8, which is highly acclaimed for its sleek and premium design courtesy of its bezel-less front panel. Although the technology is not always used to achieve curves on screens as sometimes they just allow manufacturers to add curved finishes on flat panels, as per Forbes, Google making use of them suggest that the Google Pixel 2 might actually come with a curved display. After all, with the curved display slowly becoming the norm for flagships (even the iPhone 8 is expected to have its own spin on it), such feature on the Google Pixel 2 would allow it to further compete with its biggest mobile rivals.

Some Nexus 6Ps have developed a battery early shutoff problem, and it's becoming a safety issue David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/12/20 11:10am PDTDec 20, 2016 211 Plus 1 on G+ 366 Share on Facebook 174 Share on Twitter Total Shares751 News Nexus 6P A number of Nexus 6P owners have reported an alarming battery problem with their phones as of Android 7.0 being released for the handset, which causes the phone to power down when the battery gauge still shows anywhere from 10 to 60% battery remaining. How widespread the issue is at this point isn't clear, but the main thread on the Google issue tracker has 229 stars. There are also a significant number of threads describing the problem on Google's Product Forums (see: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Owners have linked it to Android 7.0, but even those who have attempted flashing back to Marshmallow report the problem still occurs, though generally at lower indicated remaining battery percentages than on Nougat. This suggests some kind of change in Android 7.0 that is exacerbating what would appear to be an underlying hardware problem. There are some reports that 6P owners with the issue who have their batteries replaced see the problem largely alleviated, again pointing to what seems fundamentally a hardware failure that has been made worse by software. While Google has assigned the issue in its tracker, it's been given a low priority and there has been no indication of an incoming fix. Those who have attempted to receive warranty service from Huawei have been rebuffed, with the OEM telling them the problem is not with the phone or the battery, but with Google's changes to the software. Interestingly, it seems the problem is most common in very cold climates. These are where we see reports of phones dying at upwards of 60% battery remaining indicated, which is obviously completely ridiculous. As some on the various threads point out, this could easily be a major safety issue. We have become deeply reliant on our smartphones to help us get around - be it hail an Uber, navigate us to our destination with a map, or simply to call or text a person to let them know where or when we'll be. Such functions have become so critical that suddenly having your phone die unexpectedly could actually place you in danger. Imagine if you were in an unfamiliar place (one without frequent taxis), late at night, trying to hail an Uber in exceptionally cold weather, and then your phone kicked the bucket. What would you do? This actually happened to one poster on reddit, who was fortunate enough to find a hotel where he or she was able to use a phone to call a friend (whose phone number they knew - how many people know each other's phone numbers these days?) to pick them up. What if your car broke down on a freezing night and you were unable to phone a tow company? Our world and infrastructure, and our very decision-making processes as humans, have started to evolve around the ubiquity of constant connection through our smartphones. Without them, we can be left feeling helpless. We'll be reaching out to Google about this to see if they have any comment.

It does work sometimes. maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/31ff0858463dce3005d122af1771be1674201f869957270e6de3b939a5bd5adf.png Happens to me Everytime I finish a run using mapmyfitness now. This morning my battery was a lil under 50%, and I go to save my workout, and it just flashes the battery saver screen and shuts down. The only way to get it to boot is to plug it in. It did this one other time when I was playing around with Google maps battery was around 40%. Hopefully Google can figure this crap out. jfbaudio I called Google while I was still under the 1 year warranty, they replaced it for me. The problem was creeping up, from shutdowns at 4%, then 7%, and so on to 20% when I had it replaced. It took about 2 months to get there. This was during the summer so cold weather didn't play into it. Scott Harris Haven't had this problem but last week I had problems with my phone freezing on me. Was forced to have to do the power + volume down button to turn it off. Left the Android beta and didn't restore any backups. Did that like 2 days ago and so far no freezes. Have already been considering switching to iPhone, but if this battery thing starts happening to my 6P then I'm done with Android. Matías Duarte 1-Get a Note 7 2-Wait until explodes 3-Warm your N6P with the Note flames 4-??? 5-Profit. melvin My dies at 15%. When I reboot. It's back 30%. Like wth. I assumed battery was shot. Rawhi Mohammad Sounds more and more like the iPhone.. this new Pixel strategy is getting crazier by the day. just_a_regular_citizen I have the problem with my 6P. It's been worse outside in the cold. I took a screenshot right after I plugged in and restarted. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5edefbc6313ef36d560ab07169dc6fa529e1d969dd6d2f0c6c2b43f8a7df673d.png ChuckDz3 This hit me very close to home! I was involved in a car accident over the weekend due to the icy road conditions in the midwest. In the middle of calling 911 for help my phone died. My battery was at 60% before I dialed the call. It was 8 degrees outside and almost stranded with no help. Luckily I was only 5 minutes away from my place and was able to walk home. This could have ended very different due to this issue! Robert A Lyon I have the issue, BUT it didn't originally begin at 7.0. Everything was okay until a couple weeks after the push out of 7.0, my whole phone went dark, no charge, wouldn't turn on, it was just a brick. It had restarted 3 times in a row, on the third restart just wouldn't do anything. Tried all the fixes recommended online. Sent back to Huwaii and on receipt back the phone turns on but the battery drain is present. Colder weather is worse and the battery goes dead anywhere from about 20% to 15% left to zero in a matter of a second or two. Battery saver mode comes on at 15% and it'll die on me. No problem before sending it in for the other power issue. Also get it back and the camera no longer focuses in close up. So in other words, I had no problem at the initial release of 7.0, it wasn't until the OEM got it and screwed it up. Adam C Just my speculation but I do not think any battery does well with rapid charging over the long term. I never charge my 6p with rapid charging and I still have great battery life on 7.0. for over a year. I wonder how may folks that have this issue uses rapid vs standard charging. Kid.Drunkadelic I kinda of feel bad to the guy I sold mine too then, I sold cause I thought Google was back to their old shit if not quality checking and dog flooding their code enough and my battery sucked. Sucked so bad I got a 6s plus now I see how much of dramatic change in battery life I now have. I might never come back Ernie So, is it hardware or software. Sounds like a hardware problem of sorts!!! Chris B Been having this issue for around a month as well. Shutoff is usually around 10-35% and seems worse in cool weather. onekage This happened to me today! Phone was left in cold car for few hours(16°F) , unlocked the device. Battery read 58% suddenly it powered off and would not come back on. Brought inside and put on charger 61% battery. This in not acceptable. I live in a freezing cold climate 7-8 months out of the year. I'm on 7.1.1. If this continues I'll be selling the phone or getting a replacement. Dakota Rickel So should I ask Google for a replacement or wait for more news about what the exact issue is and how they plan to fix it? MisterJ Sure the battery problem is an issue, but does it pose a material danger? I don't think so. Humans have lived without phones for millennia. If you are so dependent on your phone that you think you're gonna die without it, you need to rethink your life, and come up with different contingency plans that don't require a phone. With that said, i own a nexus 6p, and i have seen phone die at around 10 to 15%, but a few nights ago, i was able push the battery all the way down to 1%. Maybe being on the Android beta program has something to do with it? va_d1m How about this situation: - stayed out really late, about ~8.5km from the home for the first time in few years. - battery died at 25%, unable to get Uber (which has been our main form of cab service for a number of years for multiple reasons). - no cabs would take me home because "it's too short a fare during shift change-over time" which is illegal but happens all the time (Melbournians would understand), - walked home Sure, I did not feel in any danger and I know my city well but since we have become so reliant on our phones (and phone companies are complicit in commoditising smart phone ownership), when they break it causes severe inconvenience to our lives. Extrapolate that to being a tourist in a foreign country the outcome can be more than just inconvenient.. MisterJ Just think about what your parents' generation would have done. It's that simple. Brett Sewell I just went through three weeks of -20 weather with the update no issues but I certainly wouldn't trust my life to my phone either in a snowstorm Tom Z I had mine shut down at 38% once. Most of the time it's around 25% when it shuts down. It doesn't even get a chance to go into battery saver. I hope Google fixes this soon. Kyle Salewski Has been happening to me a TON in the past 2-3 weeks! I thought it was just me with a faulty battery. I do see it in very cold temps, it's been negative degrees or single digits here in Milwaukee quite a few days in the past few weeks.seems to be anything under 30 or 25% and then POOF!, dead. About a week ago I was getting an Uber and shut off after I requested it. Luckily I remembered the make and license of the car picking me up downtown. I would have been stuck out in the freezing snow without a phone. It happened Sunday night and again Monday night of this week. I did run the 7.1.1 update AFTER I charged it back up last night after it died. Hopefully this update changed something, but I'm not holding my breath. KingOfRedLions7 So this is common? Mine started doing this recently at around 25% and aside from that it also drained probably around twice as fast as it should have. Then I got a new battery replacement and the day after it died around 80% but I recalibrated the battery and it's been working good as new since then. If it really is the software accelerating hardware failure than I'm going to be pissed if it starts having problems again. :/ Cory Wilson Reading this on my 6p. Haven't noticed an issue yet and hopefully I won't. But I also thought I was immune to the g4 bootloop of death problem and then it happened and it sucked. psychomaniac189 did anybody email huawei and get a response? what was the response? mine was, Thank you for contacting Huawei Device USA. We're so sorry to hear about the battery issues you've been experiencing with your Nexus. Please guide to the following troubleshooting steps to attempt to correct the charging issue. If the steps are successful but you are still experiencing battery drainage, please contact us at 1-888-548-2934. 1. Plug your charger into the wall before plugging it into your phone. 2. Hold down the power button. 3. Without letting go of the power button, plug your phone into the charger. 4. Continue to hold the power button for another 20 seconds. The phone should begin to charge normally. Noam I have this issue too. I live in Israel, haven't noticed any connection to temperature. I hope they fix this, it's driving me mad! Wilson X Nearly 40% have this issue, voted by Chinese N6P users. https://plus.google.com/u/0/+WilsonX/posts/eS6ANzEMprR wadea This problem started very soon after I updated to 7.0. It also coincided with a trip I took to South Korea; the first time I ever traveled to a non-english country. My phone died without warning at 15% one night during my trip, and although I had a reasonable amount of information written down, I still ended up stranded due to the inability to access my phone, and being in a 'suburban' area of Seoul with very few services. So yah, it can be a safety issue. I'm aware of the problem now, so when I leave again for Korea in a month, for a year this time, I'm resolving the issue by replacing my phone. I can't be in a foreign country, and have an unreliable phone in my pocket. Morten Ulv I thought that it was related to me using the 60w chromebook pixel charger for the phone. Never died above like 12% and it has been a while since I had the problem. But possibly because I charge it in time... Fartknocker Had the problem once when I took the phone out of my pocket and put it in my center console while I was driving home. It was in the single digits that night. When I got it indoors, it worked fine again and the true, original battery amount came back. Gavin Dunsire I seem to be having this issue with my Pixel (not XL model). Dorothygroybal Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Apparently, Huawei and Google just want to blame each other, while we users have to deal with the problem. Eoghan Murphy I'm seeing similar behaviour on my Moto G4 plus, and its not cold in Brisbane. Phone just shuts off randomly and when powered back on battery life is significantly reduced. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/706643efc8f98525f285b681ac3481677d6ca2c38c7c8b1620e5ca2f8e44e624.png Marc Westermann Seeing exactly the same issues since 7.0 on my Nexus 6P. The device shuts off when it hits the 15% threshold for the batterysaver. I contacted google multiple times for an RMA but they keep saying it's apps and that I should factory reset and not use apps for several days to confirm the issue. Eventually I got someone to send me the RMA link as I saw that they would charge you the full price of the nexus 6P if the returned device would be considered "flawless" in the eyes of the google support. I talked it through with the gouvernment customer care center here in germany and they said that this is unacceptable but there is nothing I can do at the moment. Worst service experience ever. Check out the screenshots, it's fun! /s https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da1b67aa1745daaa6c04379733cecb5d1423f4555bae8ddeaf1f9d66fa67b404.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/54e3430ee46793e40bc03539c9c2f72e32df6893bb5f5a742d95ff4ad887b533.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5f87b86e96716feb8fd4b94d202750630c0ddf98f297f357f9a095af4b962113.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6f6295d0e83ce0143d97df04c8bfdfc328bd9be95086bb09851f2385781f6a4d.jpg Stefano Miranda Hi. I am also here in Germany, but I have the big problem that my German is not really that good, so I was not able to find any Huawei customer center neither am I able to talk to the customer support in German. What makes it even more complicated is that I bought it on Amazon France, and I don't speak french either so I cannot complain with them. Please, if you have any information that may be relevant, send me a comment down below. I am even willing to pay for a new battery, this problem is really frustrating. Marc Westermann Wow, that's quiet a situation you got yourself into. As far as I can tell, there are Huawei shops in many major cities in Germany. There is also a support hotline from which I would assume that they talk at least basic english. But I think your best chance would be to contact Amazon in your origin country. I could imagine that they could help you as well. If not, I'd try Amazon France in english. Stefano Miranda I live in Munich but I did not see any Huawei shop here. do they also offer customer service in the shops? do you have a list? If I google for that I just find the Design Center here in Munich and not the Handy's shop LOL Marc Westermann Just search for them on google maps. I don't know if they offer customer service, but I'd assume that. It's pretty standard in germany for shops to also offer assistance on products. mchalakov What would you do? Hmmm I don't know .. WALK! Like all the 'poor' humans do where there is no Uber. And just change the battery... Josh They will never admit anything. They literally kept making us wait with ridiculous request after ridiculous request until finally the warranty expired for issues we had with bend gate and the glass popping out randomly with normal use. Google has purposely scammed a lot of people with this phone. Never will I ever purchase another Nexus or pixel product. Brian Michael Last week I gave up my Nexus 6p after battery drain issues and also when I upgraded to Nougat 7.1 my 6p kept bootlooping. So, I just bought a OnePlus 3T to hold me over. I am very pleased. I'll definitely think twice before buying another Google phone. Matt I am having issues with the battery, drops fast. And turns off randomly below 14% I did contact google, my device is less than 6 months old. They are replacing it for free. Aniket Vasishth I am glad that AP wrote an article on this.. at least now it will be taken seriously by Google Cenzo Great. The way this author writes, it won't be long before smartphones will be declared a necessity. paulmike3 For you, it might never be. For others, it is. Don't judge what you don't understand completely. Cenzo You obviously don't understand what basic human necessities are. paulmike3 I do. If we were talking about basic human necessities, I would agree with you. We're not. You said "necessity", which is a different classification. A car, a phone, electricity, heat, etc. are all necessities in my life (home, work). Without them, I would be in a critical safety situation, given the 12F temperature outside right now. The article remains spot on. Cenzo Corrected for context. Latheryin If you think it is then you have bigger issues then battery problems. There is nothing to understand. Might want to check anyone that thinks it is as they have some very big mental issues. Jonas Andersson Mine dies every night at about 15%. I have battery saver at 15% but the screen turns orange and about the same times it dies. Victory Hand I used to have this issue but 7.1.1 seems to have fixed it. Laird Rixford Mine always happens after using the camera. Even at 25%+. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bbea09d0194204d95339235943431ae6a221f8a4e195dc3a98d6a53a024fc310.png w https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8db3f5c513a96eafe8f20c1d778f421d2f4a7f072c60c59f588f59959ac515cd.png Russell I've had the same issue after updating my Pixel XL to 7.1.1. I contacted Google support and they said other users are experiencing the same issue. Hopefully a fix comes soon because my phone shuts off sometimes with just less than 50%!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/343c7bd4c50adb1781ede1d1bd3de748fb0b529b5ed87694d38ed96d8216c77f.png paulmike3 This is good info, thanks! If you haven't already, please post this on the Android bug report thread as well (and state that it's happening on your Pixel XL) -> https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=227849 Michael Hall This is a big fat joke. It is crap like this which makes the iPhone look more and more tempting. If I'm anywhere near 20% then open up a high drain app like Snapchat, it just dies. I love Google, but Christ they are useless. Andre Natale David, please stay on top of this. I thought I was alone In this issue but I am glad you made light of it. dblock The behavior of this is very strange, as it happens to me, but usually never above 30% battery remaining. It only happens to me when I use something that seems to be resource-intensive. I noticed that it mainly happens when I use my camera while the battery is below 30%, or something that utilizes the camera, like Snapchat. Otherwise it seems like I can drain my battery down to 0 if I don't use my camera. I have never seen it randomly shut off while using anything else, that I can recall anyhow. Still, I assume something like Uber might also cause this behavior, especially when you are awaiting a ride to show up and the ride tracker map is up, as that is probably somewhat resource-heavy. Either way, it is unacceptable. For me, this started happening as soon as I started using Nougat in general, not 7.1.1 specifically. Initially I thought it was just a result of custom ROMs, however now that Nougat is more widely available, it looks like that is not the case at all. Chris Babes This has really been effecting me greatly! Please fix. I'm at the point where I may have to get a new phone. I work outdoors in Ontario, Canada. So frustrating and dangerous. Robert Andersson Buy a Huawei. melvin my just did it at 37%.. so frustration. Alex O’Brien Same thing happens to me although I live in a warm climate (California) and, to the best of my recollection, has only happened once my battery is around 15%. It is definitely a safety issue. sodsavage Having this same issue, didn't know it was a widespread problem. Believe it or not, I was actually assaulted because of this issue affected a situation. RVCA It sounds like only a small amount of people are impacted. Haha Suckers!! Arman G This has actually happened to me recently. It was like -10C, phone had a 50% charge left and died on me, just as my Uber driver went past me. So I missed the Uber and the ability to get to my destination in time. I had to rely on m my work iPhone the rest of the night. See the screenshot of the battery meter. No explanation for the sharp power dip. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cf7a5e1479a23d65e57b6cd424f788820e14c622977f8b62b35cbeaecce7211a.png Ger PG I live in the not-so-cold weathers of Mediterranean Europe but yesterday I spent a whole day in Prague at -5 ºC and my phone kept dying at 35%. Later at night I saw this article in Android Police describing this issue and I felt like you were explaining my day. I spent 550€ on this phone 6 months ago, so they'd better be fixing this soon. By the way, I am still running Android 6.0.1, so add this build to the list of affected ones. jobber99 this happened to me starting in september, i was on 7.0 i believe--would get to 15% and then down to 0. i called google store support, and they replaced my 6p. it is now also happening to my wife's phone, on 7.1.1, but it's too late i think for her to call google store support as the phone is > 1 year old now Kelly This happens to me. The first time I was out of town (and the phone was a month old) so it was extra scary. I didn't know this is what was happening but now that you describe it, it fits. I pull my phone out of my purse and it won't cut on. I have to plug it in and wait for at least 30 seconds before the power button will turn it back on. It does not show the battery charging icon either, so it looks bricked. Scary!!! It's happened twice. I also notice it shutting down and/or restarting itself all the time but I think that's the stupid button sensitivity. Kelly Oh and this was way before 7.0 (it was August this year) and was indoors in a moderate climate. staticx57 I've had mine shut down numerous times at around 30% and this was on MM Chris This actually just happened to me. I was inside, sitting at 60% battery, when my phone just powers off with the low battery warning. Thinking it was just a normal crash, I reboot it and went to to plug it on the charger anyway, it fully booted (off the charger) but then showed 2% battery remaining. I looked at the battery history, it has been running for 3 hours and was somewhere around 60-65% when it literally dropped to zero. And I hadn't barely used my phone except at the very start of the day. Didn't realize it was a widespread issue, also only happened once. ( My phone usually powers off at about 10% normally, I just assumed that was within the margin of error for battery prediction) Patrick Murphy Yep mine has been doing it since it got cold in upstate New York usually 30% or lower plus since Android 7.0 dropped seemed worse Fernando Pena Never happened to me after a full year of use... Martial Clausse Was waiting the train on the platform, in the cold, phone shut down at 30%. Tried turning it on again, as soon as boot animation finished it shut down again. Once in the train, I charged it a little, and it booted up with 29% battery. Kashif Sheikh After the most recent update, my Nexus 5x went into an unfixable bootloop, which apparently is a very common issue. Not sure if this is some joint hardware/software issue, but it seems to have been triggered after a software update: http://www.techtimes.com/articles/186940/20161125/lg-cant-fix-nexus-5x-bootloop-issue-so-its-offering-full-refunds.htm MarkM Thank you for reporting on this. My 6P shut down in 20 degree temps with 55% battery left while hiking in the wilderness. I was not able to restart until it was plugged into a charger. This is definitely a safety issue that Google needs to address as soon as possible. MarkM check it out: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1ebf53c40e7e86db227443e8b655467e6a662ebae3bc6fdd181894458458ed3c.jpg Luxferro Hopefully you posted this on the Google issue tracker as well. Scott Kennedy Hah. I literally just had Google agree to an out-of-warranty replacement for this issue. I was expecting them to say no (I just needed documentation they wouldn't cover it), but the replacement arrived today. It'll make a nice gift for someone. Mine happened around 35%, indoors. Nothing to do with cold weather. Xu Mengran i am glad that people are paying attention to this. It has been keeping happening to me. the phone usually shuts off around 25% and needs to be connected to the socket otherwise cannot be turned on!!!! tibor ric Same on my Nexus 6p. Battery is dropping mast faster than when the phone was new... 3223 So much for fast updates while being half baked. Maybe oem's holding off updating their phones to rectify internal coding errors seems like a much better option than getting the fastest updates first and having these things happen.. Luke I usually don't comment, but articles like these are very important. So many issues that only occur after a certain time (especially once you're out of warranty) get swept under the rug and companies don't pay the price for making devices that don't last. I also find it worrying after reading some of the comments here, people with this issue actually consider solving the problem by buying a Pixel. Seriously guys, vote with your dollars and don't empower companies that treat you like shit. Let's hope Google can fix this. Luxferro Can we get this pinned at the top of the site until Google fixes it? If this gets no more press Google will take their sweet time fixing it, if at all. Rob Paek My 6P hasn't been shutting down but I feel like since the second to last update (I'm in the beta program) my battery life on standby is abysmal. Plus the emojis I send don't show up in the Messenger texting app (Google's, not Facebook). Brownstar No issues with mine tibor ric Living in Sweden. It was only 5°C outside... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8a00b2758b995826cf17b5f6a2c2eaee41230b56d9d301402f3ceba8f67f6c7e.png Matt Virus My 6p on marshmallow does this all the time...Sometimes at 20 or 25%....But yesterday I was doing outside work in the cold and my phone died at over 50%. Insp_Gadget Happens to me, regardless of the temperature. Happened this morning at 45% and I was indoors (hadn't been outside) for over 12 hours. imdevu Started happening on my 6P from yesterday. And suddenly it is a nightmare. Especially since 6P is my primary device (and the only one I carry) Robert Andersson Google is implementing the iPhone feature where batteries die at 30 %. Ricardo Torres My nexus 6p recently started showing this problem. Jon E. This happened to me last week while driving in my cold car during below-freezing temperatures outside. It was connected to the USB-C car charger and running Google Maps Navigation. It had around 50% battery and it randomly shut itself off, did not come back on by itself. I had to dangerously pull over while the sleet/ice was getting worse with the freezing wind, and when I turned it back on, it came on and then immediately turned itself off again. I literally SAT on my damn phone for 7-10 mins until it warmed up, then it booted up okay, but it showed 13% battery for some reason...I've been worried about it, and now here I am seeing this is a widespread issue; wonderful. Shay Carmel The issue is not because of cold environment. I live in Israel where it's 23 degrees or more and it happend to me as well, battery drain and shuts down at 16 percent. Ceridwen I've had it happen with up to 38% battery life remaining on mine. Seems to occur most often when the phone is even marginally cold (30 degree weather, phone in coat pocket) and I activate the camera. Made my husband quite angry with me once for not telling him my phone was low before it died while I was at the park with our daughter. Rather frustrated at this point because I've already RMA'd the phone twice for rebooting issues where it would refuse to turn back on for hours at a time. Not impressed with quality control for this device. Diwa Galvez Does the issue persists in 7.1.1? Mine is still on Marshmallow, and I've been holding out on the upgrade. weictay My 6P was just upgraded to 7.1.1 a few days ago and yesterday, I noticed my phone had shut down at 25% battery life. Never had this happened before while it was 7.0 so this was a surprise. Stephen Cornwell Happened to me today: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e10378fd3532e7e6b183e2085e162a4bf1f2e8b7307c1854d33caf1a2dcb1faa.png Left on the side of the road in -2°C because my phone died and I couldn't call to be picked up. Running 7.1.1 so it's obviously not fixed yet. Gerardo Sarabia I broke my pixel so while fixing it decided to use my Nexus 6p. Is dying at about 33%. Ridiculous. Any news on this? Trevor I was at 75% and this just happened as I was playing with my dog outside (I live in Canada so it is cold) and the phone just dies! I just got the phone 4 months ago too. Andrey I have the same problem. Was snowboarding at Stevens Pass in WA and just ten minutes after I hit the slopes the phone died at 40% battery. The temperature outside was 15F. Basically phone renders useless in mellow cold weather. Any updates on the fix? EastOakland510 Same thing is happening to my phone too usually after 20% Alexander Gontar Any feedback from Google or Huawei on this article? Tom Frascone (theorie) Just recently developed this problem on my Nexus 6P purchased in Jan 2016. Currently running 7.1.1 and when my battery hits 20% it divebombs to around 10% before automatically shutting off. It's winter, but I live in Florida and it's been around 70F the past month...so not sure temp is an issue. Just called Google and they said my phone is still in warranty (by only a few days) and they are going to replace it. eastprecinctguy That just happened to me tonight. Out of the country, late at night, trying to get back to the hotel, cold out - phone dies with plenty of battery life. Won't turn back on. Thank God I brought my portable charger. Not good. TrOpAzR So I just spent the last 40 minutes with Google Chat Support regarding this issue. I was the owner of a launch device and had zero issues with this phone until 7.1.1. 3-4 weeks ago my phone started shutting off between 5-10% battery. I took multiple screenshots and submitted them to Google Support. They pointed me to a list of 30 different things that I should do for "optimal" use but eventually RMA'd the device after the problem persisted even after a full wipe and reflash of the latest system images. I received my replacement device today and let it hang out on 7.0 which is what it shipped with. Battery acted completely normal and the phone was behaving really well. Had a persistent notification to upgrade to 7.1.1 and reluctantly accepted. Phone lasted about 15 minutes off the charger before it died near 25-30% battery. Attached is the screenshot. This is absolutely unacceptable. I have since been back in contact with Google Chat Support and they've promised to escalate this to a "specialist". Before I RMA'd my original device I asked them if this would continue to be a problem. They assured me that the refurbished replacement would be "tested to the highest standards" and that I would have nothing to worry about. Literally less than 3 hours after receiving the replacement device the problem is even worse than it was with my original device. Since it was on 7.0 when I received it they obviously didn't even test the replacement with the 7.1.1 update to ensure there were no issues with the software.. Simple deduction leads me to believe that this is absolutely a problem with 7.1.1. The 7.1.1 software update is obviously borking SOMETHING on this device. In addition, my old device suffered from the "echo" problem on phone calls for multiple months. However, I refused to believe there was an issue and would always tell the other person it was THEIR phone. Found out real quick that I was incorrect when I saw the thread about this issue here on XDA.. Sure, the phones aren't exploding like the Note 7.....but Google has a serious issue on their hands that they must address quickly. Unfortunately, I don't think they will. We must demand that this problem is fixed....and fixed soon. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/25eca7a15aad8a3b2a76adcefdd9d963140ea4355aa44d05663207124c0ac04e.png Ray My phone used to die around 5% when I used to take walks in the park. I thought it might have just been an issue with the phone not having enough energy to handle the gps, so I ignored it. Yesterday I was waiting for an Uber and I saw my driver go past me on the map. He called me, and right after I tried to speak the phone shut off completely. I had about 34% battery but couldn't turn the phone back on. I'm lucky he didn't just give up and go home or it would have been a major inconvenience. I owned two Nexus 6 phones and both had a similar issue as well. With the 6 there was some over heating that I think caused the issue, but back when I had a Galaxy S3 I had bad overheating and the battery never behaved like that. I feel like since they introduced all of this rapid charging technology these smartphone batteries are starting to fail quicker. Shaik Shahir I don't have the battery issue most of the time , but I think it's related to cold , becuz whenever I keep my AC on it gets damn cold inside the room and at that time my phone shuts down but when it's not cold it works perfectly . Israel Rodriguez I just went from loving my Nexus the first year after release and as soon as that update rolled out I just have grown to hate my phone I once loved. Such a shame Google is hiding from this waiting for things to blow over. I wish they do a recall or something to get it fixed otherwise this is the worst investment I've ever made Stephen Metz-Lago Same thing. Take a picture or video in cold weather and game over, even with over 50% charge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8faa6cbe1d087a3b07ba213803feed31f0f32c80e9e7220d48ad30a8b5ea1ef.png Ching-Wang Hung Thanks for reporting this but were you able to get comments from Google on this issue yet? Huawei customer support keeps saying it's a software issue and refused to provide any repairs or replacements even though my phone is still within warranty. I'm really disappointed in them and will never buy their products again. Richard Y I would always tell everyone the biggest draw of this phone is now for once, I never had to think about battery life, ever. How fast things change. Those who feel it's Nougat or the weather are mistaken. These problems started occuring when the Pixel was released - Google made sure the Nexus 6P had problems a) to get nexus owners to jump ship go Pixel and b) any bad publicity on the Nexus would ensure there would be no debate as to whether someone had to decide between the 6P and a Pixel. Weh Yeoh This issue is online in a few blogs, it's also on Google's issue tracker but as a low priority, (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=227849) which is poor form. It doesn't seem like Huawei are taking it seriously either. This issue has been unresolved for me since October. I think it's time to step it up so I've just purchased two domains, googledoesntlisten.com and huaweidoesntlisten.com. One might be able to redirect to the other. My idea is that we can post screenshots of our battery issues, our locations, and maybe a one sentence line like "I was stuck in the snow when my phone's GPS shut down" to hammer home the reality of the issue here. This might get Google and Huawei to do something, especially since it's affecting a lot of people. Problem is, I'm very poor on website design. Now that i have purchased the domains, who is willing to help me get them set up? roseskegg It happens to me all the time, and I live in the Bay Area! It's never below 45 degrees, but my phone just shut off today at 40% Tomasimpo I have been suffering from early battery shutoffs for the past month or so. Finally having had enough of waiting for Google to release a software fix for this issue I called the UK Google support and CSR immediately said it was an known issue affecting a very small number of handsets. I asked for a new handset and they said yes immediately. I now have a brand new 6p on 7.1.1 without the issue. My handset was purchased at launch from the Google Store so was over 12 months old so was expecting a fight for a new handset. Anyone in the UK who got their handset direct from Google I suggest you phone them and get yourselves an shiny new 6p. TBolt My Nexus 6P died the other day at around 20% battery life (I'm in warm Orange County, California). I started googling the issue to see if there have been any known fixes for the problem -- sadly nothing from Google or Huawei. Very disappointing for Google Android & Huawei. Justin Alick Have had this problem since December 2016, with shutdowns (and inability to restart until charging) guaranteed between 15-20% and once at 50%. This has been hugely disruptive to my professional and personal life - I recently swapped from Samsung to Google's native phones and will move on if the company doesn't fix this problem soon. Akabari I know this old but I wanted to point out this happens to me a lot, and I once had to walk 4 miles in below zero temps and stay at a hotel because of it Ricardo N Feliciano It may not be effective, but I've made a Change.org petition for this issue (and the bootloop issue as well): https://www.change.org/p/google-support-acknowledge-nexus-6p-issues Phillip Mwaniki I bought a nexus 6p a month ago and it still has this issue. Can't trust google anymore. Qadir Ali khan problem not with the device problem is with android N factory image. even I am also facing this problem when first I upgrade to android N 7.0 and problem is continues until I decide to step to custom rom . now I am on Pure Nexus rom android 7.1.1 and phone performance is awesome with a great battery life without any issue . Ricardo N Feliciano I made a petition for this problem: https://www.change.org/p/google-support-acknowledge-nexus-6p-issues Margaritas Ante Porcos This happened to my 6p now after 7.1.2 update. I am beyond furious with Google. Josh Temperature may affect it, but it's a correlation only... not the cause. It's definitely a hardware problem, but it was brought out with Nougat. We have two Nexus 6Ps. One is on Sprint (CDMA) and one is on AT&T (GSM). The Sprint one does have the problem and the AT&T one does not (regardless of temperature). Google sent me a free replacement for the Sprint one (outside of my warranty I might add because they seem to know that it is some form a hardware issue). The new phone didn't have the problem for the first few days of testing it just on Wifi. But the first day I put in the Sprint sim card and activated service, it started the bug again... this time it was actually worse (before it would die at 20-30%; this one dies at 40%). So it may be a CDMA radio problem that causes some glitch in battery level reporting with Nougat. jamesacres I wonder if I am having the same issue as I have the exact same problem but on the older first edition Nexus 5! It has been totally fine but recently randomly shuts off even if the battery is high percentage and doesn't show any shut down message. It seems to happen more often when you're using it when on the move (has been cold in England so might be related) and doesn't happen at all if it is plugged into​ battery pack. ali jawad I experience a sudden shutdown every now and then at around the 30% level. Annoying, but I still am getting a good charge that lasts until I get home after work. Just hoping it's not a potential fire hazard. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/47e975fdfd2774776983941155f26dd5864257470d2b4fe37b793945ef75e3ff.png ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 3 [Deal Alert] Staples has the Lenovo ThinkPad Chromebook 11e for $140 ($210 off) 2017/04/16 1:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] The first episode of Doctor Who season 10, plus the first episode of Class (a spinoff), are free on Google Play 2017/04/16 8:33am PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 17 April 2017 | MYT 8:30 AM Google’s ad rivals leap at chance to seize dollars after YouTube controversy Most analysts believe the YouTube boycott will have minimal impact on Google sales. Its draw is too large to keep advertisers away permanently, and the boycott has not stopped search ads, Google's bedrock. — Reuters Weeks after scores of advertisers boycotted YouTube, Google is still trying to mitigate the damage. Meanwhile, long-struggling competitors in the digital ad market are seizing the moment.  MediaMath Inc, a New York-based seller of software for automated online ad buying, is introducing a new service to ensure that ads only run alongside hand-picked, “high quality” content. The “curated market” offering comes amid concern over some big brand ads appearing against racist, violent and offensive YouTube videos.   ”We're developing for the largest brands in the world who need to be assured of a safe environment for digital advertising,” said Erich Wasserman, MediaMath's co-founder. “We're happily able to do this at a time when the market is shouting for it.”  Google has tried to silence the shouting. After the first wave of advertiser defections, Google introduced new controls to address the problem. When more advertisers left, Google added even more features and shifted resources into new technology that flags offensive videos and disable ads on them.  Most analysts believe the YouTube boycott will have minimal impact on Google sales. Its draw is too large to keep advertisers away permanently, and the boycott has not stopped search ads, Google's bedrock. Yet some marketing agencies and advertisers are re-evaluating buying plans, cognizant of the harm poor ad placement can cause. That adds pressure on Google, Alphabet Inc's biggest division.  ”If you can create a driverless car and artificial intelligence, you can figure out how to keep a brand safe,” Marc Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer of Procter & Gamble Co. told Bloomberg News in an advertising conference last week in Los Angeles.  On April 12, NBCUniversal announced a deal with mobile ad company Kargo Global Inc to place ads on 300 premium digital properties from 70 media companies. Convincing advertisers to pay up for premium content was a feat, given the discounts and wide distribution that giants like Google offer, said Kargo chief executive officer Harry Kargman. The YouTube boycott was a gift. “We were prepared for a drawn out fight,” he said. “Basically, the market has done it for us.”  MediaMath, too, views its new service as responding to a market shift. The YouTube crisis wasn't just a backlash against Google, it was a protest against the pitfalls of automated advertising in general – the systems and services that let marketers accurately target consumers but also sprinkle ads everywhere across the web. MediaMath said its new service will limit that sprinkling, sending ads to websites and online videos that it constantly monitors for quality.  The company said it has 7,000 advertisers and 500 publishers on board with the service, although it declined to share its pricing or early revenue figures.  It's likely that shifts in digital spending away from Google, if any, would not appear until later in the year. However, some ad companies said they were seeing efforts to realign spending now to avoid the YouTube fracas. Charles Gabriel, president of Apester, which makes interactive software for publishers, said that over the past two weeks marketers began requesting safety controls on all online videos where they run ads.  Google executives have argued that, given YouTube's size, brand safety guarantees for every single video are impossible. But they've reassured marketers the issue will subside.   Tara Walpert Levy, Google's vice president of agency and media solutions, told the audience at the Los Angeles conference that many advertisers that left over the issue have returned. But only Johnson & Johnson has said so publicly.   At the conference, attitudes about the YouTube scandal were mixed. Some echoed P&G's Pritchard. But others dismissed it as an inflated scandal, driven by the television industry, which is hosting its annual ad price-negotiation conference soon.   Michael Roth, head of ad giant Interpublic Group of Cos, admitted as much on stage. Much of the YouTube hubbub, he said, was a behind-the-scenes negotiation from the older industry to compete with technology upstarts.  That leverage, along with pressure from others, is necessary given the rising digital dominance of Google and Facebook. “When it's a duopoly, you always root for someone else to keep them honest,” he said. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Instagram’s Snapchat clone marks 200 million daily users milestone Large fries?

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 87 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine.

Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named.

John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users.

I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers...

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far.........

Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down.

Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here. My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor. "Genius" store crooks said I needed a new hard drive and wanted $150. Bought a $20 cable from ebay, watched a few videos and fixed it. Running fine 3 years later. Apple has known about this issue since 2007 but has never acknkowledged it. My Pro cost me more than 1400. I have had sub 500 Windows laptops easily run 5 years.

Born three years ago, with roots in a failed video game, the messaging software is now used by 5 million people. Slack Technologies found success by combining something Silicon Valley fetishizes — rich data on how people use a product — with something it often overlooks: how people feel while using it. Advertisement This combination produced an unlikely hit that, when it became available in 2014, grew mostly by word-of-mouth, unusual for corporate software. Last year, the privately held company was valued at nearly $4 billion. Now Slack faces a significant new challenge. It has become big enough to draw a competitive response from giants like Microsoft, but not big enough to have the roster of large corporate clients that it needs to compete with the giants. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Last fall, Microsoft announced a direct Slack rival called Teams, to be given free to all 85 million users of its Office 365. And Facebook made its collaboration tool, Workplace, widely available for free. Atlassian, a smaller company, has signed big customers, too. As a result, Slack, which built up momentum as a lovable underdog, must fend off some of technology’s largest and fiercest competitors if it wants to be more than a niche tool for small businesses and teams. Microsoft, for instance, already offers ways for employees to collaborate. And while its offerings have not been viral hits, they have offered boring but important features that big companies demand, like strong data security and regulatory compliance controls. Advertisement There is no illusion at Slack that success is certain. But Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive, said small tech companies with new ideas had long defeated larger rivals that tried to copy them. Think of Apple’s beating IBM in personal computing, Google’s beating Microsoft in search and Facebook’s crushing Google in social networks. Slack is the product of Butterfield’s second failed attempt to make a video game. His first, called Game Neverending, had a photo-sharing feature that became more popular than the game. It became Flickr, which was sold to Yahoo for $25 million in 2005. In 2011, he introduced another game, Glitch, in which people cooperated to build a shared world. (Misbehaving players got a timeout.) At its height, the game was costing the company $500,000 a month and bringing in $30,000, so Butterfield shuttered it in late 2012. A few employees stayed on to build out the messaging platform that Glitch engineers had used. That became Slack. Introduced in February 2014, it now has 5 million daily users, up from 4 million in October. Most are on a free version, but about 1.5 million pay $8 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search. The 750-person company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but is not profitable. Initially popular with small teams of software engineers who wanted to work remotely without cumbersome videoconferences or e-mail, Slack was not designed for big companies. Users chat in “channels,” typically organized around a few well-defined tasks. Collaboration software like Slack is not new. Google’s Wave, which started in 2009 and shut down in 2012, was supposed to replace e-mail with a messaging tool, but conversations were too hard to follow and track. Atlassian, an Australian software company, released a team collaboration platform in 2004 and acquired Slack’s nearest startup rival, HipChat, in 2012. But Slack has focused on making a product that people love, a strategy more common among consumer companies like Apple, Snap, and Spotify. If Slack can dovetail seamlessly with how people behave, feel like second nature to use, and appeal to employees, taking it away could become “like taking off your astronaut helmet in space,” Butterfield said. The battle between Slack and its rivals is a fight over who will make the next piece of workplace software that no one can live without. Slack’s name — an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge — underscores its big ambition. But to become a Microsoft-size success it needs workers to choose Slack over its competitors. “Companies want their employees to collaborate more, because better collaboration reduces the need to jump ship,” said Sean Ryan, head of partnerships at Facebook Workplace. “The number one reason people leave their jobs is they feel isolated.” “We’re trying to build empathy at scale,” Butterfield said. Slack’s office walls are covered with customer feedback, and soothing French pop music is piped into the restrooms. Company engineers say being a good designer is like being a good host, and they use shorthand like “set out the towels” as they create new user features. “I’ve been building software for 15 years, and I’ve become more attuned to how the average person will interact with and experience software in the last 18 months here than in the prior 13 years,” said April Underwood, who joined Slack as vice president of product in 2015. Whether this approach translates into profits for Slack depends largely on how fast the company can expand into more countries and whether employees at big companies push their information technology departments to pay for it. That would necessitate an unusual level of devotion to a piece of workplace software, which is why Slack says it is so devoted to its users’ well-being. “There are people who will die, get divorced, have children with cancer,” Butterfield said. “You really have to put yourself in their frames of mind. If we preoccupy these people for a minute longer than we have to, we’ll lose them.” Loading comments... Top 10 Trending Articles Most Viewed Most Commented Most Shared Real journalists.

I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both?

That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox.

The new mode, first spotted by a redditor in the Google subreddit on Reddit, turns the white backgrounds on YouTube to black—essentially inverting the color scheme while ditching the typical YouTube red logo entirely. Read: YouTube Streaming TV Service Announced, Channel List Includes ESPN, ABC, FXX, More You won’t spot a button or a switch to turn off the lights on YouTube, though — at least not yet. For now, dark mode is a hidden feature. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make use of it. Here’s how to turn on dark mode for your nighttime YouTube sessions. Turn On YouTube Dark Mode On Mac First things first, make sure you’re running the latest version of Google Chrome. The version dark mode is first accessible in is Chrome 57.0.2987.133. Once you’ve updated Chrome, you’ll need to open the developer’s window. To do so, hit Option + Command + I. The developer’s window will appear on the right side of your browser. At the top of the developer’s window is a bar with a number of menu options. Select the console tab. In the console, paste the following command: document.cookie="VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=fPQ4jCL6EiE" Once you enter the command, hit enter. Then close the developer window and refresh your browser. Click on your YouTube profile and you should see a dark mode toggle option in the main settings menu. Turn On YouTube Dark Mode On Windows Like Mac users, Windows users will want to make sure they are using the latest version of Chrome 57. Once updated, you’ll be following similar steps. Windows users can open the developer’s window on Google Chrome by hitting Ctrl + Shift + I. Once open, select the console tab from the menu running across the top of the window. Paste the following command into the console and hit enter: document.cookie="VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=fPQ4jCL6EiE” Refresh your browser and you should see the dark mode toggle appear in your YouTube settings, which can be accessed by clicking your profile picture.

Here's a look at which of the two Android phablets is worth buying.  ( Samsung ) Advertisement Advertisement Google's Pixel flagships were perhaps one of the most-loved smartphones to be released in 2016. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL handsets sold out at most retailers and the company had trouble keeping up with the massive demand. However, after the launch of Samsung's Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in March, fans have a new Android phablet vying for their attention. Here is a comparison of the specs and features of the Galaxy S8+ with the Pixel XL, to help one decide which of the two smartphone's is worth buying. Design The Galaxy S8+ touts a glass body and a curved display. Moreover, Samsung ditched the physical home button to reduce bezel space considerably. Unlike previous iterations, the Galaxy S8+ houses the fingerprint sensor on the rear of the device, just beside the primary camera. Design wise, the Google Pixel XL sports a glass-aluminum body "with smooth surfaces and easy-to-grip curved edges." Like, the Galaxy S8+, the fingerprint scanner on the Pixel XL is also located on the rear of the device. People's preference vary when it comes to the look and feel of a smartphone. However, the minimal bezels could work in the Samsung smartphone's favor Display The Google Pixel XL boasts a 5.5-inch AMOLED Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) display. The smartphone has an aspect ratio of 16:9 and 534ppi pixel density. By comparison, the Galaxy S8+ boasts a bigger 6.2-inch Super AMOLED Quad HD+ (2,960 x 1,440 pixels) display. The Samsung smartphone's Infinity display has a 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The Galaxy S8+, however, pales in front of the Pixel XL with a slightly lower pixel density of 529ppi. If a bigger and better display is what one is after, then the Galaxy S8+ is hands down the better option among the two. Processor And RAM The U.S. variant of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ houses the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. This chipset works on the 10nm FinFET technology, which makes it much faster than previous-gen ones. The Pixel XL, on the other hand, is powered by the older-gen Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor. Both the smartphones are on even keel when it comes to memory and house 4 GB of RAM. The GalaxyS8+ clearly has the edge when it comes to CPU capabilities, thanks to the latest processor being on board the device. Storage The Google Pixel XL is available in two storage options: 32 GB and 128 GB. The Pixel XL does not support expandable memory. However, all the photos are backed up to the cloud automatically at full size, which results in plenty of free space. The Galaxy S8+ is offered in the 64 GB storage option. However, one can expand the memory to an additional 256 GB. In the context of storage capabilities, the Galaxy S8+ betters the Pixel XL as by using a microSD card, one can double the space offered by the latter. Camera And Battery The Google Pixel XL houses a 12.3-megapixel rear-facing camera with dual LED flash, HDR video recording, and 4K support. The smartphone also houses an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. The Galaxy S8+ is equipped with a 12-megapixel primary shooter with innovative features like object tracker and voice activation. It too supports HDR video recording. The smartphone sports an 8-megapixel front sensor as well. The Pixel XL houses a 3,450mAh battery, while the Galaxy S8+ boasts a slightly bigger 3,500mAh one. The Google smartphone supports fast charging and one can get 7 hours' worth of charge in just 15 minutes. The Galaxy S8+ also supports fast charging, but the capabilities are yet to be known. The Samsung smartphone also has wireless charging capabilities. On paper, the camera and battery capabilities of the two Android smartphone seem to be at par. Operating System The Pixel XL comes pre-loaded with the Android 7.1 Nougat, whereas the Galaxy S8+ will come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. Other Features The Galaxy S8+ houses its very own smart assistant dubbed Bixby. The voice assistant is similar to the Google Assistant, which is present in the Pixel XL. However, the Google voice-activated assistant is now available for all Android phones, which means that Galaxy S8+ users will be able to use both Bixby and Assistant. The Galaxy S8+ also has an Iris scanner, which gives it an edge over the Pixel XL. Moreover, the Samsung smartphone is IP68 certified, which makes it water and dust resistant. The Pixel XL, on the other hand, is IP43 certified and is splash resistant. Price The Google Pixel XL retails for $769 and $869 for the 32 GB and 128 GB variants, respectively. For Galaxy S8+ the price differs from one carrier to the other. Verizon's Galaxy S8+ has been priced at around $840. AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile has priced the Galaxy S8+ roughly at $850. Both smartphones pack in top-notch features and consumers would have a tough time picking between the two. However, owing to its bigger display, faster processor, and additional security features, consumers may gravitate toward the Galaxy S8+. Those keen on snagging the GalaxyS8+ can preorder the smartphone, which will hit shelves on April 21. Users interested in picking up a Pixel XL can visit Google's Store and buy the handset.

Nowadays companies have made it so that photos taken in a particular month can be automatically grouped together, or by location, or by people, and in some cases it can even compile a slideshow of photos taken on that day itself. Google Photos is an example of such a service, but unfortunately it seems to have run into a bit of a mishap. It seems that there are quite a few users who are complaining that their “People” folder in Google Photos has gone missing. A post by user Kayla Tuite reads, “I was just looking through them last night and today they are gone. I tried taking a picture of my daughter and it created a new “people” folder for her. I was really hoping it would identify her in all of her old pictures, so I could try to rebuild my People folders. I don’t know what went wrong or if there is anything I can do from here.” The good news is that Google is aware of the issue, according to a post by Ben who is one of Google’s community managers. He writes, “Thanks for posting.  We’re aware of this and our team is looking into it. I’ll post to this thread when we have an update to provide or if it’s been fixed.” It is unclear as to when this issue will be fixed but if you’re affected by this, Sonya who is Google’s community specialist has offered up a possible solution. We’re not sure if it will work for everyone but it could be worth trying, if not we guess you’ll just have to wait for Google to get around to fixing it. Filed in General.

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 104 Share on Facebook 68 Share on Twitter Total Shares203 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Đức Thành I guess you missed the part where I said 6 smart home devices weren't any where near enough. Bring me 16 and we're talking. :D Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library. Paul Quinn I can access a single song, an album, any of my playlists, or a Google Music Playlist. I can access music from my library or from Play Music's entire catalog. I am subscribed to Google Play Music. It's possible you are seeing this if you do not have a subscription. However, you should be able to access Google's curated lists. Michael I do have the subscription. I find this really odd. Can you verify you are able to play a song that exists only in your library and not available from Play Music? How did you ask for it to be played? I have a song in my library called Alligator.MP3 as well as many others and she cannot play it. There is an entire thread on this feature not being available so I would really appreciate it if you can double check. Thanks https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/googlehome/zC9dUi3FUsk/3W6KPacnAgAJ Paul Quinn I stand corrected! It is difficult to find songs only in my library and not in GP's library but I found a couple and it will not play them on the Home. That link in the product forum has an answer that says it should work. Am I reading that wrong? It's marked as "Best Answer." Michael Well, it should work if/when Google supports it. The bad thing is they are completely mum on the subject and won't really commit on it. People who report it are being given the old "we'll send your feedback to to the developers​.". Every other Android device works as we expect it to but not Home. It will only play your playlists and that doesn't depend on the subscription.

By Myriam Jessier April 12th, 2017 AMPAppsMobile 7 Comments Big news from Google: Within a few months, the infamous search engine will divide its index1 to give users better and fresher content. The long-term plan is to make the mobile search index the primary one. Why does this matter for e-commerce website owners? Well, it will enable Google to run its ranking algorithm differently for purely mobile content. This means that mobile content won’t be extracted from desktop content to determine mobile rankings. That’s definitely something that retailers can leverage, thanks to AMP. This article outlines how to get started with AMP and how to gain an edge over the competition with your e-commerce website. Further Reading on SmashingMag: Link What Are Progressive Web AMPs?2 Turn Your AMP Up To 11: Everything You Need To Know About Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages3 Current Trends And Future Prospects Of The Mobile App Market4 A Case Study: Is App Indexing For Google Worth The Effort?5 AMP For Purely Mobile Content Link So, how do online retailers go about leveraging this big Google announcement? With AMP content! AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) just celebrated its one-year anniversary. It is an open-source project supported by Google that aims to reduce page-loading times on mobile. AMP pages are similar to HTML pages, with a few exceptions: Some tags are different, some rules are new, and there are plenty of restrictions on the use of JavaScript and CSS. AMP pages get their own special carousel in Google mobile search results. No official statement has been made yet about whether these AMP pages will be getting an SEO boost. 6 AMP pages get their own carousel in Google mobile search results. (Image: Myriam Jessier7) (View large version8) Is AMP Worth It? Link While initially geared to blogs and news websites, AMP has introduced components that make it easy to adapt to an e-commerce website. To date, more than 150 million AMP documents are in Google’s index, with over 4 million being added every week. AMP isn’t meant purely for mobile traffic; it renders well on mobile, tablet and desktop. The AMP project’s website9 is actually coded in AMP HTML, in case you are curious to see what AMP looks like on a desktop. eBay was one of the most notable early adopters in the e-commerce realm; by July 2016, it took more than 8 million product pages live in AMP format and plans on going further. Arguments In Favor Of AMP Link Conversions, Conversions, Conversions Link Google is touting a reduction of 15 to 85% in page-loading time on mobile. The main advantage of AMP for retailers is that slow loading times kill conversions. Selling products to people when they want them makes a huge difference to a business’ bottom line. Many shoppers will go to a competitor’s website if yours is too slow to load. Put that in a mobile context, and a slow loading time means losing 40% of visitors — potential customers who will take their dollars elsewhere. Visibility Is Key Link In brick and mortar stores, shop fronts are a big deal in attracting customers. It’s the same online, except that your storefront is supported by the speed of your customers’ Internet connection and the visibility you get on various channels (such as search engines, social media and email). Visibility is another way retailers can leverage AMP. Visibility is also a major element of the AMP equation. This is especially true in countries with limited mobile broadband speed10. And before you think this particular challenge is exclusive to developing nations, keep in mind that the US is not ranked in the top 10 countries in mobile broadband speed. AMP pages feel like they load blazingly fast. Here’s a comparison: Non-AMP page loading AMP page loading Mobile-Friendly Is A Thing Of The Past For Google Link User experience is central to most online retailers. A slow website with bloated code, an overwrought UI and plenty of popups is everyone’s nightmare, especially on a mobile device. The “mobile-friendly” label was introduced by Google in late 2014 as an attempt to encourage websites to ensure a good mobile user experience. After widespread adoption of responsive design, the mobile-friendly label is being retired by Google in favor of the AMP label. 11 This is how AMP results show up in Google mobile currently. (Image: Myriam Jessier) (View large version12) AMP pages could be featured in a carousel and are labelled with a dedicated icon, highlighting them in search results. The search giant has recently stated that AMP would take precedence over other mobile-friendly alternatives such as in-app indexing. However, AMP is still not a ranking signal13, according to Google Webmaster Trends analyst John Mueller. AMP: Because Mobile-Friendly Doesn’t Cut It Anymore Link Media queries adapt the presentation of content to the device. However, the content of the page itself isn’t affected. In contrast, AMP helps make mobile web pages truly fast to load, but at a cost. Developers, designers and marketers will have to learn how to create beautiful web pages that convert using a subset of HTML with a few extensions. AMP For E-Commerce Link The premise of AMP14 is that mobile-optimized content should load instantly anywhere. It’s a very accessible framework for creating fast-loading mobile web pages. However, compatibility with the AMP format is not guaranteed for all types of websites. This is one of the realities of a constantly evolving project such as AMP. The good news is that many of the arguments against AMP for online retailers no longer hold up. Benefits For E-Commerce Websites Link AMP pages are now able to handle e-commerce analytics thanks to the amp-analytics variable. With this variable, statistics are available to analyze an AMP page’s performance in terms of traffic, revenue generated, clickthrough rate and bounce rate. According to the AMP project’s public roadmap15, better mobile payments are planned, after the addition of login-based access, slated for the fourth quarter of 2016. Product and listing pages are supported in AMP, and they show great potential to add real value to the online customer journey. Keep in mind that 40% of users will abandon a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load16. Worse yet, 75% of consumers would rather visit a competitor website than deal with a slow-loading page. Drawbacks Link Some of the drawbacks that have been noted are mostly due to the fact that AMP for e-commerce is rather new. There are a few concerns about the quality of the user experience offered by AMP e-commerce pages because some e-commerce functionality is not yet available, such as search bars, faceted search filters, login and cart features. However, frequent updates to the AMP format are planned, so this shouldn’t be a deterrent to those looking to implement it. 17 How eBay implements AMP pages (Image: iProspect18) (View large version19) There has been some grumbling about the format among marketers. AMP relies on simplified JavaScript and CSS. As a consequence, tracking and advertising on AMP pages is less sophisticated than on traditional HTML pages. That being said, the main drawback is that implementing AMP pages effectively will take time and effort. The code is proprietary, heavily restricts JavaScript (iframes are not allowed, for example) and even limits CSS (with some properties being outright banned). How to Develop AMP Pages for an E-Commerce Website Link To ensure that your website is AMP-compliant20, check the instructions provided in the AMP project’s documentation21. Keep in mind that AMP pages should be responsive22 or mobile-friendly. A best practice would be to test the implementation of AMP pages against your current mobile website using a designated subset of pages. This will give you a sample to determine whether AMP adds value to your business. You don’t have to make your entire website AMP-compliant. Start upgrading the website progressively: Pick simple static-content pages first, such as product pages, and then move on to other types of content. This way, you can target highly visible pages in SEO results, which will lead to a big payoff for the website without your having to deal with pages that require advanced functionality not yet supported by AMP. If your website uses a popular CMS, then becoming AMP-compliant could be as easy as installing a plugin. Magento The AMP extension by Plum Rocket23 automatically generates AMP versions of your home page, category pages, product pages and blog pages. An interesting feature is that the AMP home page isn’t just “converted”; you can edit it in Magento’s back end. WordPress AMP for WP24 is a plugin that lets you create custom AMP designs without having to code. You can customize the logo, header, footer, images and more. It is compatible with WooCommerce and AdSense. The plugin generates AMP versions of your home page, blog articles, WooCommerce shop, products and categories pages. Shopify Nothing yet, but it’s under way! A Step-By-Step Guide To Implementing AMP On Your E-Commerce Website Link Let’s break down the process according to the customer journey. AMP offers a selection of prebuilt components to help you craft an enjoyable user experience on an e-commerce website (along with some evolving tools to help you collect data in order to improve it). You can implement four major AMP elements along key points in the customer’s purchasing journey, including on the home page, browsing pages, landing pages, product pages and related product widgets: product descriptions, reviews, product shots, navigation. The entire purchasing flow can’t be 100% AMP-compliant yet, so you’ll have to plan a gateway to a regular non-AMP page for ordering and completing purchases. 1. Browsing (Home and Product Pages) Link Users will often start their purchasing journey on a website’s home page or a product category page, because these pages are prominent in search engine results. These pages are great candidates for AMP, as eBay has shown25 by making many of its category pages AMP-compliant. Typically, category pages are static and showcase products for sale. The amp-carousel feature26 offers a way to browse other products in a mobile-optimized way. These products can be organized into subcategories that fit the user’s needs. You can view the annotated code to create a product page over on AMP by Example27. 28 AMP e-commerce home page (Image: AMP by Example) 2. Landing On A Product Page Link After browsing to a category page, the next step for our user would be to find an interesting product and click on it. In an AMP-compliant flow, this would lead the user to an AMP product page29. 30 AMP product page (Image: AMP by Example) Your AMP product page could include the following: a great hero banner (image or video) using the amp-carousel31 and amp-video elements32; detailed sections, which use the amp-accordion tag33 and which enable the user to easily share the product’s URL via the amp-social-share element34; a navigation menu (across all of your pages, actually), using the amp-sidebar35. Here is a preview of what the AMP carousel looks like on mobile: AMP mobile carousel> 3. Exploring Related Products Link Showing related products36 benefits the retailer’s bottom line and the user’s experience. The first product that a user browses to isn’t always the one that fits their need. You can show related products in AMP in two ways: Statically publish a list of related products. Generate the list on the fly using amp-list37 to fire a CORS request to a JSON endpoint that supplies the list of related products. These related products can be populated in an amp-mustache4138 template on the client. This approach is personalized because the content is dynamically generated server-side for each request. 4. Personalizing and Understanding Link Personalization is a big deal in e-commerce because it increases conversions. To dip into personalization in the AMP format, you can leverage the amp-access39 component to display different blocks of content according to the user’s status. To make it all work, you have to follow the same method as we did with the amp-list40 component: Fire a request at a JSON endpoint, and then present the data in an amp-mustache4138 template. Keep in mind that personalization doesn’t have a leg to stand on without reliable data. Google has been actively extending the tracking options available in AMP. You can track users at an aggregate level using the amp-analytics component6242; AMP supports several analytics vendors.43 Sidenote: In case you see cdn.ampproject.org in your Google Analytics data, this is normal for AMP pages; cdn.ampproject.org is a cache that belongs to Google. No need to worry about this strange newcomer to your Google Analytics data! AMP now supports some analytics products, such as Adobe’s and Google’s own. The type attribute will quickly configure the respective product within the code. Here’s an example of type being used for Google Analytics: <amp-analytics type="googlenalytics">
 And here are the types for some of the most common analytics vendors: Adobe: adobeanalytics Google Analytics: googleanalytics Segment: segment Webtrekk: webtrekk Yandex Metrica: metrika Google Tag Manager44 has taken AMP support one step further with AMP containers. You can now create a container for your AMP pages. 45 Google Tag Manager’s AMP container (Image: Myriam Jessier) More than 20 tag types are available out of the box, including third-party vendor tags. Alongside a wider selection of tags, Google has provided built-in variables dedicated to AMP tracking, making it easier for marketers and developers to tag their pages. 46 AMP tracking options in Google Tag Manager (Image: Myriam Jessier) If you are not using Google Tag Manager, you can implement your tag management service in one of two ways: endpoint This acts as an additional endpoint for amp-analytics and conducts marketing management in the back end. config This manages tags via a dynamically generated JSON config file, unique to each publisher. The endpoint approach is the same as the standard approach. The config approach consists of creating a unique configuration for amp-analytics that is specific to each publisher and that includes all of the publisher’s compatible analytics packages. A publisher would configure using a syntax like this: <amp-analytics config="https://your-dream-tag-manager.example.com/user-id.json">
 Many online retailers rely on advertising or showing related products throughout their website to boost revenue. The AMP format is bootstrapped to show ads through <amp-ad> and <amp-embed>. The documentation is quite clear47 on how to implement ads, and the good news is that a wide variety of networks are already supported. Although iframes are not allowed in AMP, two embed types support ads with <amp-embed>: Taboola and Zergnet. If you plan on using ads in AMP, follow these principles48 in your development work: Faster is better. Ads should be fast. Beauty matters. Keep ads beautiful and innovative. Be safe, be secure. All creative must use the HTTPS protocol. 5. Supporting Purchases Link The previous step was a tricky one because it entails maintaining a seamless user experience while the user transitions to a full HTML page. The process should be fast and consistent for the user. An experience that isn’t consistent with the preceding AMP journey could hurt conversions. If your website is a progressive web app, then amp-install-serviceworker49 is an ideal way to bridge both types of pages within the customer journey, because it allows your AMP page to install a service worker on your domain, regardless of where the user is viewing the AMP page. This means that caching content from your progressive web app can be done preemptively to ensure that the transition is smooth for the customer, because all of the content needed is cached in advance. An easy way to experience the entire AMP e-commerce experience is to head on over to eBay50; see how the company handles the transition from AMP to an HTML checkout process. 6. Keep Caching In Mind Link AMP works within a smart caching model that enables platforms that refer traffic to AMP pages to use caching and prerendering in order to load web pages super-fast. Be aware of this when analyzing traffic and engagement because you might see less traffic to your own origin when AMP pages are originally hosted (this is why we referred to cdn.ampproject.org in Google Analytics data). The balance of traffic will most likely show up through proxied versions of your pages served by AMP caches. Tools To Validate AMP Pages Link The AMP Validator51 In Google Search Console, AMP-related issues are shared under “Search Appearance”: 52 AMP validation In Google Search Console (Image: Myriam Jessier) A whole host of useful resources are available if you have any questions: Webmaster Central Help Forum53 Ask questions about AMP and Google’s implementation of AMP. Stack Overflow54 Ask technical questions about AMP. GitHub55 Submit a feature request or contribute. You could even design a component56 yourself. Experimenting With AMP Link eBay has shared its experience57 in implementing AMP for its own e-commerce platform: Best practices AMP encompasses a lot of best practices for building mobile web pages. Incorporate mobile best practices as part of your regular development lifecycle. Less forking in code If you follow AMP best practices when building regular pages as well, you can reuse most of the UI components between AMP and non-AMP pages. That means less forking (except for the JavaScript-based components). AMP component list There is a growing list of components58, such as sidebar59, carousel60 and lightbox61, that are critical for a compelling e-commerce experience. Internal search Adding AMP’s ecosystem to one’s internal search would be a very interesting prospect for many online retailers. Mind you, there are some complex parts: Infrastructure components Things such as global headers and footers and tracking modules have some JavaScript, which is a no-go for AMP. This adds complexity to development but can be worked around. Tracking AMP provides user-activity tracking through its amp-analytics component6242. The component can be configured in various ways, but it is still not sufficient for the granular tracking needs of most online retailers. However, once you get past the internal hurdles, the payoff can be great. Check out the examples provided by eBay for camera drones63 and the Sony PlayStation64. (Use a mobile device, of course, otherwise you will be redirected to the desktop version.) SEO-Related Questions Link SEO experts are pushing for AMP adoption because some see it as a mobile-visibility asset to be leveraged. Here are some SEO points to ensure you get the most out of AMP: Host AMP pages on the same domain as other page versions. The Google AMP cache is a proxy-based content delivery network for delivering all valid AMP documents. It fetches AMP HTML pages, caches them and improves page performance automatically. An AMP page is served to the user from the Google AMP cache, and it will have a different URL so that duplicate content issues are avoided. If you have both AMP and non-AMP versions of your pages, use the <link rel="canonical" href="[canonical URL]" /> tag on the AMP page and <link rel="amphtml" href="[AMP URL]" /> on the regular page. For a standalone AMP page (one that doesn’t have a non-AMP version), specify it as the canonical version: <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/url/to/amp-document.html" />. One of the most common URL structures is to add /amp/ to the path of the URL. Conclusion Link An e-commerce website can’t be 100% compliant with AMP, but there are benefits to adopting the format early on. Online retailers looking for an edge against fierce competition might be wise to turn to this format to grab the attention of mobile customers and nudge open their wallets. More and more websites are converting to the AMP format to increase or maintain their mobile traffic. For an online retailer that has a multi-channel or mobile-first strategy to acquire and retain customers, AMP might be a great way to future-proof their online marketing efforts.

Website owners need to realize that AMP pages are served from Google servers, which means visitors never actually visit your website. If a user clicks on a link that actually transports then to the real website, pages will look and feel different, which is bad from a user experience standpoint. Many standard features that visitors expects are disabled by design. Visitor interaction features like comments and product reviews that are important for engaging customers won’t be available. Do you want users to be able to copy URLs to save or share? Forget about it. The URLs are to Google servers. AMP pages are terrible from a user experience standpoint. Google’s forums are filled with more than a year’s worth of user requests to disable AMP from their search results. So far Google refuses to provide that option. Want to change your mind later and disable your AMP pages? Google doesn’t provide a way to flush the AMP pages from their search results. So expect 404 errors. Think twice. Reply 13 2 Saijo George April 13, 2017 2:13 am Agreed with Tom. If you are running WordPress you might also want to look at “Glue for Yoast SEO & AMP” it’s in the official WordPress Plugin repo. Also considering that AMP content sits at the TOP of the SERP how is that not considered to an SEO boost ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Reply 0 3 Joey April 13, 2017 2:15 am “AMP pages are served from Google servers” Which, of course, means that you can find a clear privacy policy statement somewhere. Oh wait… Reply 1 4 Monkey April 13, 2017 7:38 am I think most limitations you describe here are from an AMP plugin you use and not necessarily from the AMP specifications itself? “If a user clicks on a link that actually transports then to the real website, pages will look and feel different, which is bad from a user experience standpoint.” If the other pages look and feel different than the AMP page, this is indeed bad for the user experience. I think the key of a good AMP implementation is that you actually prevent these pages from looking different. Most of CSS is supported and JavaScript should not be required to be able to properly view a page. The Google AMP cache adds an extra header on top of the page, but apart from that I don’t see why the pages need to look different. “Many standard features that visitors expects are disabled by design. Visitor interaction features like comments and product reviews that are important for engaging customers won’t be available.” Whose design? Comments and product reviews can just be HTML which the server can output dynamically. If you want to seperate them from the static content to allow for longer caching you can use amp-list to retrieve a fresh list of comments via JSON and output it using a mustache template. “Do you want users to be able to copy URLs to save or share? Forget about it. The URLs are to Google servers.” The URLs can still be saved or shared whether they are google URLs or not. They just now link to the same page you get to when you arrive from a Google result. (the one with an AMP header on top of it with a convenient link icon to link you to the original page) “AMP pages are terrible from a user experience standpoint. Google’s forums are filled with more than a year’s worth of user requests to disable AMP from their search results. So far Google refuses to provide that option.” and “Want to change your mind later and disable your AMP pages? Google doesn’t provide a way to flush the AMP pages from their search results. So expect 404 errors.” I have no personal experience with using it, but isn’t that what update-ping is for? Reply 0 5 Yannick April 13, 2017 10:07 am Hi Agreed with Monkey here, it’s mostly about the plugin you use and your implementation. Plugins are making progress, just like the AMP system itself. I am the developer of one such AMP plugin for WordPress, so I have studied the matter quite closely. “Many standard features that visitors expects are disabled by design. Visitor interaction features like comments and product reviews that are important for engaging customers won’t be available.” There is no problem displaying reviews or posting comments on AMP pages, at least with WordPress (native WP comments and Disqus). This is entirely automated and does not even require custom programming (again, for WordPress). For ecommerce, aside from reviews, products can be added to cart directly from the AMP page on your site or even directly from the Google Cache copy of the AMP page. What’s not possible at the moment is checking out, though this should be possible in the future. Forms such as contact form, newsletter subscription, etc can also now be converted automatically (CF7 and Gravity) and operate on AMP. Still some limitations, such as no support for ReCaptcha ATM, or no multipage forms. “If a user clicks on a link that actually transports then to the real website, pages will look and feel different, which is bad from a user experience standpoint.” They should not click on the link to the real site. They should click on a link to an AMP page on your site. I think the confusion comes from the assumption that “AMP pages are hosted by Google”. They are not. AMP pages live on your site, on your server. Simply, Google uses a cached copy when they display a page from inside search results, which allows faster display. “Want to change your mind later and disable your AMP pages? Google doesn’t provide a way to flush the AMP pages from their search results. So expect 404 errors.” AMP pages are not part of the search results (they are canonicalized to the standard HTML corresponding page). Being in search results, the actual ranking, is based on your desktop (now) or mobile-but-not-amp (maybe in the future) content. Once they decided a page should be on the search results, and user is on mobile, and an AMP version of the page exists, then it will be used for display. Not all is rosy though: Analytics for instance is easy, but sessions and bounces are biased, or requires complex coding to get right. Also, some features require coding, although plugins such as ours are allowing more and more without coding. And of course, no, they don’t provide a ranking boost per se, as ranking is based on full site content. You do get prominent position in the search results, and the ranking boost may come at some time though. At least that’s the official position from Google. Cheers Reply 0 6 Rafael Corrêa Gomes April 12, 2017 7:42 pm Very useful, thanks for sharing Myriam! Reply 1 7 Monkey April 13, 2017 7:36 am Nice article, I have a few notes on it though: “The code is proprietary, heavily restricts JavaScript (iframes are not allowed, for example) and even limits CSS (with some properties being outright banned).” JavaScript is actually not allowed on AMP pages at all, but I don’t consider iFrames being JavaScript. iFrames are actually allowed, but are limited in that they should not be visible until scrolling down. “These pages are great candidates for AMP, as eBay has shown” and “An easy way to experience the entire AMP e-commerce experience is to head on over to eBay” Clicking those links triggered my anti-virus: “High Risk Website Blocked http://www.ebaytechblog.coom/2016/06/30/browse-ebay-with-style-and-speed Access to this page is blocked as the threat Mal/HTMLGen-A has been found on this website.” May be a false-positive, but something to be wary of. “The entire purchasing flow can’t be 100% AMP-compliant yet, so you’ll have to plan a gateway to a regular non-AMP page for ordering and completing purchases.” and “An e-commerce website can’t be 100% compliant with AMP, but there are benefits to adopting the format early on.” What exactly is not possible with AMP that prevents it from being 100% compliant with “an e-commerce website”? You do mention limitations in tracking, but does is that necessary for all e-commerce websites? Reply 1 Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

APRIL 17 — It’s not every night I have dinner with a YB (unless I include my kids who are self-proclaimed YBs), so I felt my trip to Penang last week was special. I first met Steven Sim Chee Keong at the McDonald’s in SS2 about an ice-age ago. Since that time, this college kid has morphed into one of our country’s most promising leaders. MP for Bukit Mertajam, he’s also a Senior Executive Officer at the policy think tank Penang Institute and in 2012 was named a Young Global Leader at the World Economic Forum in Geneva. Learned philosopher in the making that he is — and probably the only high-profile Malaysian who’s a self-professed fan of Slovenian psychoanalyst-thinker Slavoj Žižek (see Note 1) — Steven (see Note 2) has also published a book on politics and philosophy titled The Audacity to Think (which my friend and I initially confused with Obama’s Audacity of Hope, but Steven swears he’s forgiven us). Super-hero politicians So we went to this placed called Starview Restaurant along Jalan Dato Keramat. The joint used to be a kopitiam, today the place rivals even giants like Tai Thong in terms of façade and splendour, a renovation which (I couldn’t help notice) mirrors what Steven himself underwent. Almost the first thing he talked about — after ordering a totally sumptuous fish steamboat which defied reason and hot water — is the need to do away with superheroes in politics. According to Steven, superheroes are a symptom of how regularly and extremely messed-up our society is. Imagine having to thank a doctor each and every week for the amazing surgery or treatment he’s done for one of my loved ones; wouldn’t this suggest that something is absurdly wrong with my family’s health? Instead, according to Steven, politicians should be inconspicuous. Like a Google server administrator working in the background, politicians should only be making the occasional tweak (and very rare critical fix) whilst the machine runs efficiently in public. The fact that people don’t yearn for regular news about who runs Google’s systems only proves how effective it is. Likewise, the rakyat shouldn’t have to fixate on saviour politicians like travellers in a sinking ship or hostages on a plane. The health of a polity may, ironically, have an inverse relationship to the preoccupation of its members with politics. Of course, what Steven shared with us probably needs to be qualified by his own article here (where he suggests that maybe superheroes are needed after all?) but it’s hard to disagree that a nation which needs so much saving is hardly a paragon of good politics. (At this point I was gobbling down some roast duck which, frankly, overwhelmed my ability to take mental notes.) Anyway… The illusion of celebrities and VIPs being ‘just like us’ Steven proceeded to muse about how the cultivation of an “ordinary Joe” personality may diffuse accountability on issues like corruptions or scandals. Take, for example, a corporate leader who’s guilty of CBT to the tune of millions. This person may then appear on TV in a T-shirt walking to the pasar malam to buy mangoes, invites you into his home and you see his children making nasi lemak in the kitchen, and he screams when Liverpool scores a goal, complains about how the cat scratched the sofa, etc. What’s happening here? The (very effective) illusion being created is that this leader is “just like us.” He’s a “normal person” with “everyday problems and enjoyments and fears”, all of which makes it easier for us to accept and excuse the distance that his public role introduces into the picture. Because we’ve seen him do something biasa like queue up to buy satay or struggle to carry some boxes from the living room to the garden, there is this tendency to believe that, “Oh, this guy is at heart completely normal but the pressure he faces in his role pushed him towards committing certain crimes which, really, are not his fault. In the end, he’s actually a victim of the entire political process.” Steven of course claims this simply cannot be the case. Accountability and justice cannot be demurred even an iota on account of the appearance that he’s “one of us.” In truth, and taking this beyond what Steven said, I’m of the view that it is precisely the image of the “ordinary” that increases the awe or aura we usually experience when thinking of VIPs or celebrities. Consider those photos of people like Angelina Jolie eating a hot dog on the street whilst maybe struggling with her umbrella or searching for her keys — just like normal people do, right? But think about it: Do such photos raise or lower the esteem we hold towards her as an A-list Hollywood star? If Vin Diesel walked into Suria KLCC to eat chicken rice (like a normal guy), and he sat about three tables away from us, would that raise or diminish our wonderment at his larger-than-life personality and career? Clearly, the answer is that we’ll be in even greater awe of him. The banal tends to exacerbate the symbolic gap between VIPs and mere mortals. Of bankruptcies and clichés In between tasty helpings of roast duck and stir-fried kuey teow, Steven also shared his view about how, paradoxically, the youth and women wings of political parties should work themselves out of existence (because if a party is truly egalitarian and all-rounded, why have special units?); how some wealthy people avoid taxes and what-nots by transferring their money to their wives and just declaring themselves bankrupt (which, IMO, gives a grand twist to the concept of “true love”); how merely having a column in an online newspaper doesn’t mean one’s voice must be heard let alone granted equal importance as the voice of folks who’ve cut their teeth in politics for years; how he can’t believe people still wax eloquent phrases like “Malaysia needs more democracy”; and about how he can’t deny the truth of the laxity of Malaysian higher education but how he sees hope all the time when chatting with local grad-entrepreneurs. Translated: If you want to impress Steven, don’t show how satisfied you are with the system as it is, but also jangan tembak jer. Try your best to work, to create something new and, subsequently, vanish away because your job’s done and it’s time to pass the baton. If you want to piss Steven off, do nothing more than complain and churn out more clichés and shibboleths (in other words, sound like a politician). Another thing which also irks him are folks who cling to tradition for the sake of it, at the expense of kindness and compassion. Finally, if you want to connect with him, buy him dinner and share ideas (from parliament to pastors to durians to erotica, etc.) but do so from an angle which disrupts conventional wisdom. Better yet, read some Žižek and trade philosophical jokes with him. Best of all, do a Stephen Chow impression from one of his movies from the 1990s — and watch Steven do his. Thanks for the conversation, YB. After our meal, I suspect you’ll disagree with the following quote from one of your favourite thinkers: “I don’t know why we’re here, but I’m pretty sure it’s not in order to enjoy ourselves.” Note 1: I’m delighted to have co-written a paper with Steven which analyses Bersih through the lens of jouissance, or what is known in psychoanalysis as that libidinal matrix of pain-pleasure into which human subjects are incurably soaked. The paper was published in the Asian Journal of Political Science in 2014. Check it out. Note 2: Call him YB more than twice and Steven waves it off. Very well. * This is the personal opinion of the columnist.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week In conversation with Steven Sim Manufacturing offence as political strategy Making monkeys out of us Fikir dahulu sebelum buat United broke its contract with frequent flyers — Noah Feldman Teenage dream and child marriage Making monkeys out of us RU355: A birthing imbroglio Timely reminder for minorities In the grave: Why Holy Saturday matters Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Coolest drone trick shots ‘The Last Jedi’ meets ‘The Force Awakens’ Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles Cops summon two DAP MPs over ‘event’ last year E-Kad for illegal immigrants extra red tape, says MP Manual for Malaysian politicians Federalising Penang: What the locals say Restore local elections in Federal Territories instead, Penang MP tells Ku Nan (VIDEO) Advertisement What You Think More When politics take centre stage — Sin Chew Daily Dealing with radicalisation in Malaysian universities — Mohd Mizan Mohammad Aslam United for competition — Tunku Zain Al-’Abidin Don’t destroy this country! — Chen Yoke Lin Lim Kit Siang repeating himself again — Lim Sian See Umno’s winning formula for GE14 — Tay Tian Yan MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both?

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox.

Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't.

Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Now we are on the cusp of a new grand leap thanks to the democratization of machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. This process of democratization is already underway, according to this opinion piece by Kartik Hosanagar (@khosanagar), Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions, and a cofounder of Yodle Inc., and, Apoorv Saxena (@apoorvsaxena1), a product manager at Google and co-chair of the recent AI Frontiers conference. Last month, at the CloudNext conference in San Francisco, Google announced its acquisition of Kaggle, an online community for data scientists and machine-learning competitions. Although the move may seem far removed from Google’s core businesses, it speaks to the skyrocketing industry interest in machine learning (ML). Kaggle not only gives Google access to a talented community of data scientists, but also one of the largest repositories of datasets that will help train the next generation of machine-learning algorithms. As ML algorithms solve bigger and more complex problems, such as language translation and image understanding, training them can require massive amounts of pre-labeled data. To increase access to such data, Google had previously released a labeled dataset created from more than 7 million YouTube videos as part of their YouTube-8M challenge on Kaggle. The acquisition of Kaggle is an interesting next step. Market-based access to data and algorithms will lower entry barriers and lead to an explosion in new applications of AI. As recently as 2015, only large companies like Google, Amazon and Apple had access to the massive data and computing resources needed to train and launch sophisticated AI algorithms. Small startups and individuals simply didn’t have access and were effectively blocked out of the market. That changes now. The democratization of ML gives individuals and startups a chance to get their ideas off the ground and prove their concepts before raising the funds needed to scale. But access to data is only one way in which ML is being democratized. There is an effort underway to standardize and improve access across all layers of the machine learning stack, including specialized chipsets, scalable computing platforms, software frameworks, tools and ML algorithms. “Just like cloud computing ushered in the current explosion in startups … machine learning platforms will likely power the next generation of consumer and business tools.” Specialized chipsets Complex machine-learning algorithms require an incredible amount of computing power, both to train models and implement them in real time. Rather than using general-purpose processors that can handle all kinds of tasks, the focus has shifted towards building specialized hardware that is custom built for ML tasks. With Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) and NVIDIA’s DGX-1, we now have powerful hardware built specifically for machine learning. Sponsored Content: Highly scalable computing platforms Even if specialized processors were available, not every company has the capital and skills needed to manage a large-scale computing platform needed to run advanced machine learning on a routine basis. This is where public cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and others come in. These services offer developers a scalable infrastructure optimized for ML on rent and at a fraction of the cost of setting up on their own. Open-source, deep-learning software frameworks A major issue in the wide-scale adoption of machine learning is that there are many different software frameworks out there. Big companies are open sourcing their core ML frameworks and trying to push for some standardization. Just as the cost of developing mobile apps fell dramatically as iOS and Android emerged as the two dominant ecosystems, so too will machine learning become more accessible as tools and platforms standardize around a few frameworks. Some of the notable open source frameworks include Google’s TensorFlow, Amazon’s MXNet and Facebook’s Torch. Developer-friendly tools The final step to democratization of machine learning will be the development of simple drag-and-drop frameworks accessible to those without doctorate degrees or deep data science training. Microsoft Azure ML Studio offers access to many sophisticated ML models through a simple graphical UI. Amazon and Google have rolled out similar software on their cloud platforms as well. Marketplaces for ML algorithms and datasets Not only do we have an on-demand infrastructure needed to build and run ML algorithms, we even have marketplaces for the algorithms themselves. Need an algorithm for face recognition in images or to add color to black and white photographs? Marketplaces like Algorithmia let you download the algorithm of choice. Further, websites like Kaggle provide the massive datasets one needs to further train these algorithms. “The final step to democratization of machine learning will be the development of simple drag-and-drop frameworks accessible.” All of these changes mean that the world of machine learning is no longer restricted to university labs and corporate research centers that have access to massive training data and computing infrastructure. What are the implications? Back in the mid- and late-1990s, web development was done by specialists and was accessible only to firms with ample resources. Now, with simple tools like WordPress, Medium and Shopify, any lay person can have a presence on the web. The democratization of machine learning will have a similar impact of lowering entry barriers for individuals and startups. Further, the emerging ecosystem, consisting of marketplaces for data, algorithms and computing infrastructure, will also make it easier for developers to pick up ML skills. The net result will be lower costs to train and hire talent. We think that the above two factors will be particularly powerful in vertical (industry-specific) use cases such as weather forecasting, healthcare/disease diagnostics, drug discovery and financial risk assessment that have been traditionally cost prohibitive. Just like cloud computing ushered in the current explosion in startups, the ongoing build-out of machine learning platforms will likely power the next generation of consumer and business tools. The PC platform gave us access to productivity applications like Word and Excel and eventually to web applications like search and social networking. The mobile platform gave us messaging applications and location-based services. The ongoing democratization of ML will likely give us an amazing array of intelligent software and devices powering our world.

A few comments: (1) Specialized chipsets have no near-term impact on the trend towards democratization. Google’s TPU and NVIDIA’s DGX-1 support powerful deep learning applications, but these will continue to be out of reach for most business users. (2) MXNet is a project of the Apache Software Foundation, not Amazon. Amazon has announced (informally) that it plans to use MXNet, but so do many others. Amazon’s own deep learning project, DSSTNE, isn’t going anywhere. (3) Marketplaces will have little or no impact on the enterprise unless the applications sold through this channel are supported by a trusted vendor. (4) The authors omit the most important factor contributing to democratization, the trend towards automation of the data science process itself. “Drag and drop” tools alone are insufficient for all but the simplest projects. Advances in AI enable software developers to reproduce data scientists’s expertise. This is the key innovation that makes it possible for organizations to greatly expand the pool of people who can contribute to machine learning projects. Thomas W. Dinsmore WG79 Peter Kinnon Too much attention is paid to individual machines and the underlying evolutionary mechanisms which have long had “machine learning” under way are usually ignored. In actuality, the real next cognitive entity quietly self assembles in the background, mostly unrecognized for what it is. And, contrary to our usual conceits, is not stoppable or directly within our control. We are very prone to anthropocentric distortions of objective reality. This is perhaps not surprising, for to instead adopt the evidence based viewpoint now afforded by “big science” and “big history” takes us way outside our perceptive comfort zone. The fact is that the evolution of the Internet (and, of course, major components such as Google) is actually an autonomous process. The difficulty in convincing people of this “inconvenient truth” seems to stem partly from our natural anthropocentric mind-sets and also the traditional illusion that in some way we are in control of, and distinct from, nature. Contemplation of the observed realities tend to be relegated to the emotional “too hard” bin. This evolution is not driven by any individual software company or team of researchers, but rather by the sum of many human requirements, whims and desires to which the current technologies react. Among the more significant motivators are such things as commerce, gaming, social interactions, education and sexual titillation. Virtually all interests are catered for and, in toto provide the impetus for the continued evolution of the Internet. Netty is still in her larval stage, but we “workers” scurry round mindlessly engaged in her nurture. By relinquishing our usual parochial approach to this issue in favor of the overall evolutionary “big picture” provided by many fields of science, the emergence of a new predominant cognitive entity (from the Internet, rather than individual machines) is seen to be not only feasible but inevitable. The separate issue of whether it well be malignant, neutral or benign towards we snoutless apes is less certain, and this particular aspect I have explored elsewhere. Stephen Hawking, for instance, is reported to have remarked “Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all,” This statement reflects the narrow-minded approach that is so common-place among those who make public comment on this issue. In reality, as much as it may offend our human conceits, the march of technology and its latest spearhead, the Internet is, and always has been, an autonomous process over which we have very little real control. Seemingly unrelated disciplines such as geology, biology and “big history” actually have much to tell us about the machinery of nature (of which technology is necessarily a part) and the kind of outcome that is to be expected from the evolution of the Internet. This much broader “systems analysis” approach, freed from the anthropocentric notions usually promoted by the cult of the “Singularity”, provides a more objective vision that is consistent with the pattern of autonomous evolution of technology that is so evident today. Very real evidence indicates the rather imminent implementation of the next, (non-biological) phase of the on-going evolutionary “life” process from what we at present call the Internet. It is effectively evolving by a process of self-assembly. The “Internet of Things” is proceeding apace and pervading all aspects of our lives. We are increasingly, in a sense, “enslaved” by our PCs, mobile phones, their apps and many other trappings of the increasingly cloudy net. We are already largely dependent upon it for our commerce and industry and there is no turning back. What we perceive as a tool is well on its way to becoming an agent. There are at present an estimated 2 Billion Internet users. There are an estimated 10 to 80 Billion neurons in the human brain. On this basis for approximation the Internet is even now only one order of magnitude below the human brain and its growth is exponential. That is a simplification, of course. For example: Not all users have their own computer. So perhaps we could reduce that, say, tenfold. The number of switching units, transistors, if you wish, contained by all the computers connecting to the Internet and which are more analogous to individual neurons is many orders of magnitude greater than 2 Billion. Then again, this is compensated for to some extent by the fact that neurons do not appear to be binary switching devices but instead can adopt multiple states. Without even crunching the numbers, however, we see that we must take seriously the possibility that even the present Internet may well be comparable to a human brain in processing power. And, of course, the degree of interconnection and cross-linking of networks within networks is also growing rapidly. The emergence of a new and predominant cognitive entity that is a logical consequence of the evolutionary continuum that can be traced back at least as far as the formation of the chemical elements in the first stars. This is the main theme of my latest book “The Intricacy Generator: Pushing Chemistry and Geometry Uphill” which is now available as a 336 page illustrated paperback from Amazon, etc. Netty, as you may have guessed by now, is the name I choose to identify this emergent non-biological cognitive entity Knowledge@Wharton Partners View All Partners Partner Collaborations Become a Content Partner The Wharton School is committed to sharing its intellectual capital through the school’s online business journal, Knowledge@Wharton.

The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) and US corporation Google are planning to announce the results of negotiations on a settlement agreement regarding the company abusing its dominant position in the Russian market of mobile application stores on the Android operating system (owned by Google). On September 14, 2015 the Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized Google Inc. and Google Ireland Ltd. as having breached the competition protection law under the complaint of the Russian Internet company Yandex. According to the regulator, Google obliged manufacturers of Android OS-based devices to pre-install its applications together with Android platform. FAS said that Google’s policy restricted installation of applications by other developers. Google did not agree with the ruling and appealed to the court. On September 29, Google started to notify Russian users of the Android devices about the possibility of changing the search engine, deactivating pre-installed applications, installing third-party services (including third-party search engines and widgets, email, calendar, and other services) and changing position of application icons. Google noted it continues to work with FAS on technical execution of their orders. Google lodged an appeal against the court judgement in favor of FAS regarding the case on abusing dominant position. FAS also imposed the fine for abuse of market dominating position in the amount of 438 mln rubles ($7.8 mln). The amount of the fine consists of 9% of company’s turnover on the Russian market in 2014 plus inflation. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Companies Google Top News April 17, 0:15 Supporters of presidential system claim victory in Turkish referendum April 17, 0:15 April 16, 14:14 Russian senate speaker, Saudi Arabia's king stress need to jointly fight against terror April 16, 14:14 April 16, 14:19 Putin greets Orthodox believers on Easter Sunday April 16, 14:19 April 16, 2:49 North Korea attempts another missile test but fails — media April 16, 2:49 In other media Реклама Photo 12 The 2017 World Car of the Year and its rivals at the New York Auto Show 15 How Russians conquered the Arctic in vintage photos 13 Futuristic supercars at the Geneva Motor Show Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Gas agreement signed by Russia, Ukraine and the EU Altai gas pipeline Economical sanctions against Russia Most read Now Today This week 1 Russia’s hypersonic anti-ship Zircon missile reaches eight times speed of sound 2 Arctic off-roader expedition starts from Russia's Arkhangelsk 3 Ecologists are against oil terminal construction in northern Krasnoyarsk territory 4 Supporters of presidential system claim victory in Turkish referendum 5 Polina Popova crowned Miss Russia-2017 6 Troops in west Russia to hold drills with upgraded air defense missile systems 7 Russian army may start receiving 5th-generation T-50 fighter jets in 2018 1 Russia’s hypersonic anti-ship Zircon missile reaches eight times speed of sound 2 North Korea attempts another missile test but fails — media 3 Polina Popova crowned Miss Russia-2017 4 Russian senate speaker, Saudi Arabia's king stress need to jointly fight against terror 5 Putin greets Orthodox believers on Easter Sunday 6 Putin, Medvedev attend Patriarchal Easter service in Moscow 7 Afghanistan asks Russia for support in supplies, training for military, police 1 Russia’s Supreme Court to continue hearings on Jehovah's Witnesses ban 2 Jehovah’s Witnesses former members tell court they were subjected to ‘total control’ 3 Hundreds poisoned in US-led coalition’s strike on IS depot in Deir ez-Zor 4 Kremlin comments on Ivanka Trump’s 'role' in Syria strikes 5 Snowden: 'Mother of all bombs' in Afghanistan hit US-built tunnels 6 Putin: Russia has data on new provocations planned against Syrian authorities 7 Lavrov-Tillerson meeting round-up TOP STORIES CONFLICT IN SYRIA RUSSIA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY OIL& GAS INDUSTRY SPACE PROGRAMS Реклама News Russian Politics & Diplomacy World Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 87 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine.

If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball. We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2.

ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own.

Biggest privacy myths debunked International Business Times James Billington 11 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL The richest women in the world Financial stats that sum up average Americans © Provided by IBT Media (UK) Google Home privacy myths debunked Is Google Home always listening to me? It's one of the most common questions asked about the voice-activated smart speaker. With wary consumers still unsure whether Google is spying on their conversations, it's time to separate the fact from fiction. Google Home is muscling in on Amazon's dominance in the market, meaning there's going to be a whole new audience of people looking cockeyed at the little speaker. IBTimes UK has already busted the privacy myths surrounding Amazon's Echo, now let us set the record straight and help quell any fears over Google's ominous omniscience – it's not eavesdropping. IBTimesUK spoke to Google engineers about how it works and what it does with your data. Is Google Home spying on conversations? The biggest myth about Google Home is that it's continually recording what you say in the privacy of your home. While technically its microphone is always on, it's only listening out for the 'Okay, Google' hotword to activate it. It only records around two-seconds of audio, discards the snippet, then starts again. Anything that was recorded isn't saved we were told. Like the Amazon Echo, the speaker's microphone is constantly listening out for users to say the hotword to activate it and will display its four coloured LEDs on the top to let you know it has an ear out. It's not bugging your home like some reports lead you to believe. You can freely talk about your darkest secrets next to your Home without any fear it's setting off any alarms at Google HQ. © IBTimes UK Google Home smart speaker Can I stop Google Home from listening? Yes. A microphone mute button is located at the back. It has an icon of a microphone with a line diagonally through it. You could also switch the unit off altogether if you're really paranoid, but as we've explained, you don't need to do that and there wouldn't be much point in owning one if you did. Is Google Home storing my activity? Yes. We know Google isn't jotting down endless conversations in the privacy of your home but what you should know is that any questions, queries and commands you direct at Google Home are stored on its servers for an indefinite amount of time. This may sound slightly unsettling but Google assures us it's not for nefarious purposes – it's to make its Home more effective. The more search queries owners feed Google Home the smarter it becomes. The reason why Google's online search is so good at getting results is because its deep learning has refined the answers over 18 years for billions of searches, including ones that are full of typos or inaccurate. It also gathers data to make Google Home offer more personalised answers to users. Where things get less transparent is when you use Services. Third party app-like add-ons such as Uber and Domino's do store your conversation history (things like last pizza you ordered) so next time you use it it'll be able to remember your preferences. According to Google, it transcribes what you say and sends the text, but not the audio, to the third-party service provider. © Eric Risberg/File In this Oct. 4, 2016 file photo, Rishi Chandra, Google group product manager, talks about Google Home during a product event in San Francisco. Can I delete my activity? Yes. Users are able to see everything they've asked Google Home on the Google Home app and delete as desired. To do this you need to tap the menu button (three vertical lines) at the top left corner and select more settings. Scroll to the bottom of the page and tap 'My Activity'. Here you will see all your interactions. Tap the options icon (three vertical dots) on any activity and hit delete to remove it from results. Can Google Home access my personal data? Yes. But only if you allow it. One of Google Home's selling points is that it can connect to your Gmail, calendar and location data (ie maps) so it can tell you what you've got on the schedule for the day and things like if there's traffic on your daily commute. Of course, you can turn this all off by going to the My Activity section of the app but you'd be losing a rather useful feature of the device. © Spencer Platt/Getty Images/File People visit the new Google pop-up shop in the SoHo neighborhood on October 20, 2016, in New York City. The shop lets people try out new Google products such as the Pixel phone, Google Home, and Daydream VR. The products will be available for purchase offsite at Verizon and Best Buy retail stores. Does Google Home share my personal data with anyone? Yes and no. According to Google's Home support page it does not sell your personal information to anyone, however it says it does share information with some third parties. It lists an example of ordering an Uber through Google Home, whereby it would send the company your details in order to process the transaction. Is Google Home or Amazon Echo more secure? Neither should fan fears of eavesdropping. They both work in very similar ways to how they 'listen' out to owners' hotword and both have activity logs in their respective apps where you can delete interactions as you please. They both will share your information with some third parties if you give it permission but this will likely to be something you would have needed to supply in order to use that Service or Skill in the first place.

[Update: Google killed it] Burger King's stupid new ad triggers the Google Home to tell you about Whoppers Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/12 11:28am PDTApr 12, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 309 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares447 News Videos Update 1: 2017/04/12 11:54am PDT Looks like Google isn't too happy about this ad either, because that voice command has actually been disabled. Interestingly, it only stops the commercial from asking the question, it still works manually. Always-listening voice assistants, like Google Now/Assistant or Alexa, can't really tell the difference between you talking and someone else (unless you have Trusted Voice enabled on Android). Maybe you've watched a few tech videos where someone said "Ok Google," and your phone started talking back. Burger King seems to be the first company to purposely trigger Google Now/Assistant in a television ad. In the below video, a Burger King employee says "Ok Google, what is the whopper burger," right before the ad ends: As mentioned above, turning on Trusted Voice on your Android devices gets around this, but the Google Home has no such option. Searching Google Trends for "what is the whopper burger" shows a graph of Burger King's victims: If you wanted to be funny and edit the Whopper page on Wikipedia to say something else, the page has already been locked due to vandalism. It also looks like someone from Burger King changed the page immediately before rolling out the ad to list the ingredients at the top (which has since been reverted). Let us know in the comments below if you've seen the ad on TV.

That's actually quite smart. MJ Pissing off potential customers is smart? Nicholas C They will get tons of free attention from this. So yea. Sup People get pissed off so easily :/ EowynCarter Well, yeah, I don't like ads. So intrusive ad like this tends to get the opposite effect. MisterAlex If I'd theoretically been watching cable television (which I don't subscribe to) and this ad came on and triggered my phone and/or Home, I'd be far more amused than irritated. And it's not like Google would have ever let it last long, anyway. Impulse_Vigil It's amusing for all of 5s, sets a bad precedent and encourages a drove of similar stunts tho. Ryan Johnson Yeah what a shame that people get pissed off from having some advertisement take advantage of their devices to read marketing BS at them. Not to mention editing & hassling Wikipedia to have the first paragraph say what they want. Everyone already knows what the Whopper is anyway abc Who said they're pissed off? I bet a lot of people heard their Google Home list the ingredients and just thought "cool" or "whatever". AndroidUser00110001 Funny... Kieron Quinn In before someone really good at SEO makes a site which takes over the card read out by the Home to say something against BK Kieron Quinn Or, as it's been done before, simply edit the wikipedia page at the right time so the spider resets the text to say it Corbin Davenport The Whopper page is already edit locked. Kieron Quinn Shame. Will have to be an elaborate SEO trick then My1 it's semi-locked only though. meaning only registered members can edit iirc. Pessimippopotamus Google Home needs trained voice recognition like yesterday. the_secret The article does mention "trusted voice" can be enabled, like today! Suicide_Note Not on Google Home devices it can't. EcE Reading and comprehension is hard. nxtiak Trusted voice is only on phones. UniBroW Beta product is Beta ilovetesla this is not stupid , its smart guys EcE It's bullshit. MisterAlex No, it's brilliant. It is obvious from the onset that the voice response would be disabled on the back-end by Google—so it would, at worst, be a nuisance for Home owners for a very brief time. But we're all watching the video and discussing it. This very short, very low-budget video has more than done its job. EcE Sure, it got people talking about it but I'm sure everyone who got caught off guard by it went running to their nearest BK. Marcelove If you are an idiot, then sure it is bullshit. EcE aaaaand blocked Powsniffer0110 Wahhh ilovetesla a property of an ad is to make people talk about the product,they utilised the power of technology to talk about it and they succeeded JD Stupid like a fox. Kwetsima Maluleke Hmm. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd13dabd7f3d4c34cb64cf739e07667abaae63d75d00f8bde0825356ec5533c0.png Dallas King https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9e0913e1541e50871ddd3c59f560aa29f35950c5071a10e04a0b71e1f539d4e6.jpg MJ It should be illegal (but it is not nor will ever be) and Google should do something about it? The only thing they can do and should do is allow owners to change the activation phase or enable Trusted Voice on the Android Home. David Brideau LOLLLLL! mondeca Thank goodness I always fast-forward through commercials. deprofeet Brilliant... mondeca Of course this triggered an edit war on the Wikipedia page for the Whopper. JD Soon all commercials will just be "Ok Google, tell me about x" Syukri Lajin should we blame them? or Google's suck-ass voice recognition? ilovetesla turning on trusted voice is the only way out of this issue but AP says home doesnt support trusted voice Biff Wonsley Another way is to let us change the Google in OK Google to Jarvis, Beavis, Nadine, whatever. Google deserves this for not letting us customize. ilovetesla saying OK Google sucks, custom trigger voices must be made zurcaled11 This is an evolution of the Google Home Beauty and the Beast ad. Google definitely is in on it. And unfortunately it makes me want the Google Home less. demarcmj Google was not "in on it" (per the source article) But I agree stuff like this only makes me less interested in a Google Home (even though my interest level was very low to begin with). zurcaled11 You are right, the update to the article definitely makes it clear Google was not OK with it. If you want ads pushed through Google Home, you apparently have to go through Google! demarcmj Very interesting. They moved pretty fast on that. Andy J As they should of, this ad was harmless - but the next one - might not be. And as people often leave the room during adverts - a lot of people wouldn't necessarily be there to witness it adding a calendar entry or adding something to a shopping list - or further into the future - record "exciting new program" on Thursday. John Samuel αΩ It was only a matter of time. Michael Crider Quarter-pound beef patty, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo, ketchup, sesame seed bun. Bullshit you can't tell me that in 15 seconds. ilovetesla laziness at its best Brandon David Obert Isn't that a Big....

Carson Saldanha Nope, he's an imposter using polyjuice potion ilovetesla why dot you have the AP staff badge near your disqus name your companions artem and jeff has them Michael Crider I don't work here anymore. ilovetesla nnnnnnooooooo.....i didnt know that man........ roberto.elena Don't ex-cops get ex-cops' badges? Michael Crider I wish I could customize them but Disqus only lets one site have one badge. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Wow man..just like that? No farewell post nothing? You sir were one of my fav AP writers, even when you clearly had a different political alignment (like that matters...or does it?). Anyways all the best for your future endeavours. P.S. I would just like to take this opportunity while I can to express my sincere apologies for a reply I once posted under an article of yours covering the FBI app for most wanted criminals. I kinda photoshopped your profile pic and name in the screenshot for the app just for fun.. It got deleted instantly making me realise that maybe I shouldn't have(?) But I assure you it was just for fun, no disrespect intended. Well, so long. Powsniffer0110 He had a farewell article I thought. Paul_Werner I didn't see one. Now I'm wondering where he writes for if he does at any new site Michael Crider I remember that post. I was on the fence about deleting your comment, but I REALLY didn't want that Photoshopped image to come back in a Google photo search for my name, where people might ignore the context and think I was an actual criminal. Anyway, I took a full-time job at How-To Geek at almost the same time that Liam left to work for Google. I didn't want two major "bye, I'm not working here" posts on AP in the same week - that would give the impression that this site isn't a wonderful place to work (and for the record, it definitely is). So since Liam's career move was actually relevant to Android, I put mine on Google+. Jay Burger King's face right now. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a81da022eefe3eb5833231aa2593041d2bc8f33bbecb98f3e2dcba6e83e2d85d.jpg DJ SPY Haha this is pretty funny. Is it too much to ask for you guys to have a sense of humor? Why call it stupid? JSo It activates my phone but it tells me it can't recognize my voice. So they didn't get a search from me. Orlando aka Pixel XL Burger King use to be decent.... Syukri Lajin Oh look. an update. Whataburger must be enjoying those free advertising it's getting now. ROFL. this got me thinking, will they keep breaking the search results until it stops promoting a company? or will they actually fix it? lol Matt74UK Stupid? I think that was a rather amusing idea. I prefer the Big King to the Whopper though. mark555055d hmm, now the guy in the commercial can no longer use his Google home. :) Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Nah, all he needs is a helium balloon.. Carolacoffman Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Ryan If only Google had allowed us to define our own activation phrases. NunjaBusiness I have been asking for that ever since the first iteration. I want so badly to say to my phone: "Bitch, what is the weather going to be tomorrow?" Adam Margeson I think that, if not for Trusted Voice, you would end up activating several people's devices given that were an option. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yet another reason why I'm glad I don't have Google Home or "Ok Google" enabled on my phone. Now, if he says "Alexa wikipedia whopper burger" next time, then I'd be in trouble. Тарас Мукин Well, the idea of putting "OK Google" in the commercial was pretty obvious. And to be honest — this is a really good execution. Clear and simple. I understand that it pisses people off, and I think I would be pissed too, but this is a good ad — executed good and works good (well, at leas worked until Google stepped in) Joshua Richards Nope. Not a good ad. It hurts brand perception, by being annoying. Leahelm Thank goodness Google stepped up, hope BK and everyone else learns stuff like this is obnoxious. tim242 Google Home is obnoxious... Leahelm Lucky for you then you don't have to buy one Nogib Random aside: how is it that Amazon's TV ads don't trigger my Echo when they say "Alexa"? MisterAlex Amazon controls bot their own commercials and the back-end for Alexa search... so I'm guessing they make sure to put in exceptions to prevent talking to themselves. Sir_Brizz This, plus there are a few tricks that you can use to avoid this like checking for a specific background tone. Leonardo Baez Is a shit$# move from burger king.... But genius one as well. JD NO ONE CAN ADVERTISE IN CHEEKY FASHION EXCEPT US! - Google. Francois Roy Believe it or not, those Google bad foks disabled the command in Assistant, but NOT in OG Google Now!! XD Mike Miller The case could be made that this is already illegal and Burger King broke the law. Technically, it is an intentional and unauthorized use of someone else's personal device. I mean, it would be a ridiculous case, but the case could be made. MisterAlex Nah. You consent to too much "okay, I'm letting this thing listen to the world" fine print for that to ever hold water. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Burger King burgers are terrible. saimin Who is more evil? Burger King or Pepsi or United Airlines or Sean Spicer? tim242 United Airlines, Google, Sean Spicer, Pepsi...in that order. Notice, I added one and subtracted one. Max Johnson Out of all of those, I would say the diabetes inducing brand. Marcelove I don't usually call people bad names, but this article has a level of stupidity that is impossible to avoid: Corbin, do you only sucks Google's dick or you allow him to put in your ass too? It is Google's responsability that the device is being triggered by the commercial... So stop being a pussy trying to blame Burger King instead your boss (Google's ads paying AP). Following your thoughts, if you install Philip's lights at home and let Google Home control it, and a commercial is launched on tv about the lights, showing how it works , where a actor says the commands, making the lights at your home be changed, it is the maker of the ad responsible for this situation, and not Google... Typical case of someone trying to "blame the others", instead of blaming the real responsible for something that you don't like because the real responsible has some relation with you... Sir_Brizz WTFH? Of course it would be the ad maker's fault in your example. The ad creator acted in bad faith. I personally know I could probably activate all kinds of smart home commands through a TV commercial including turning on/off sprinklers, locking/unlocking doors, turning on/off lights, fireplaces, opening garages, etc. I don't do that because it would damage my reputation and brand to act in bad faith in that way. That's also why this commercial is so stupid. What does it do other than damage Burger King's reputation and brand? There is probably a higher than average chance that people who own devices this would activate already know what a "Whopper burger" is so it doesn't increase brand awareness. Best case scenario, you mildly piss people off. Not a great best case. Honestly, why would you even start to blame Google for this? They could do the same thing with Alexa or anything else. Makes you wonder why they specifically targeted Google devices. james fuston Still happening on my Google Home Andy J That's odd - it's been blacklisted on Google's end - doesn't require any updates on your end. Glich Trusted voice is only a Partial fix. I have it on my phone yet Jeff Jarvis on this week in google sets off my phone at least once per show.. some times 4-5 times.. Ibrahim Yusuf It never triggers for me, not for any video on the internet. Not even my brother can activate the Assistent on my phone Jovic Corcega You have Trusted Voice turned on, that's why. Hogarth Ferguson It was pretty quick to be put down, but pretty clever while it lasted. I still wont buy a whopper, but tip my hat to them for the try. Deeco Burger King got Whoopered by Google lol Nick Nope. Still works. Andy J It was actually pretty cool when it worked. Much more interesting though is that it's been blocked using the ContentID system (like when you used to be able to say "listen to my tv" and within 5 seconds Google had returned results about the exact program I was watching, whether it was live, recorded 5 months ago or episode 1, series 1 of Buffy The Vampire Slayer via Netflix or even off my DVDs). The Verge reports that Google also blacklist their own adverts for the same reason - to prevent devices springing into life responding to the example commands in the advert. Now what is exciting / impressive - is the speed at which Google strips the background sound from the live stream of audio from your device, matches the fingerprint of the advert and then sends the command to the device to cancel the search. It's literally seconds. This bodes extremely well for their ability to identify which registered user is asking it a question before they have finished asking it - once multi user rolls out. Sukigu Where did you read it uses Content ID? If that's the case, it really does seem an incredibly powerful technology that I'm sure could have many other uses... Andy J The Verge reported that Google blacklist their own ads to prevent devices responding to them, contentID fingerprinting is really the only efficient way to make this happen, especially given Google broadcast adverts in multiple countries and languages. So the most efficient way to blacklist it is by uploading it to an existing service and checking for a contentid match. I'll be having a go later at playing the advert while the dog is barking and see if Google can still remove enough of the background room noise to prevent Home from responding to the advert. Lev Bronshtein Sputtering goons and nerds are wound up too tight. Laugh, it's clown world. Andrexx Just another example why one should be able to customize the trigger phrase, and have the option to allow activation only by trained voices. fatlantis This was a brilliant idea for whoever their agency was. We're all just hating because we're still not over the creepy king mask. JG Considering all of the command processing is done at Google, they should be able to set up some kind of check for things like this in the future. If the same (well similar enough - each house will have different background noise) trigger is detected within a short time frame at multiple locations Google should automatically void out any active requests and blacklist the trigger. A few months back a news reporter in San Diego was doing a report on how a little girl ordered a $600+ dollhouse through the family's Amazon Echo and the parents didn't know until it showed up at the house a few days later. During the report, apparently several viewers had their Echo units triggered to order doll houses as well. Today it might just be news reporters or companies trying to get some free PR... But tomorrow it could, there could be more malicious intent. Maybe someone does a pirate radio broadcast over a popular morning talk show and says "Hey Google, call 1-900-XXX-Free"... Next thing you find out you have a 3hr call at $10/min on your phone bill...

Brilliant, but dirty. lol... JLV90 were they expecting to trigger phones or the google home? they should have triggered alexa if they were doing the home stuff JG So apparently Burger King was prepared and aired a slightly altered commercial, allowing them to trigger the Google Assistant even though Google blocked the original audio. http://www.adweek.com/creativity/google-disabled-burger-kings-ad-hijacking-google-home-but-bk-got-around-that-too/ Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 4 [Deal Alert] Staples has the Lenovo ThinkPad Chromebook 11e for $140 ($210 off) 2017/04/16 1:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 26 [Deal Alert] The first episode of Doctor Who season 10, plus the first episode of Class (a spinoff), are free on Google Play 2017/04/16 8:33am PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail?

I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 87 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball. We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers...

I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2.

And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones !

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 87 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball. We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

He wasn't telling you to google that phrase, that is what google says when they release a new build of android. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. If it compiles, it's ready. No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down.

I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

Username or e-mail: * Password: * Create new account Request new password Close Home » Arts & Entertainment » Local Rich Warren: A few suggestions on device updates Sun, 04/16/2017 - 7:00am | Rich Warren Apple recently rolled out the penultimate upgrade/update of its iOS 10 operating system, 10.3.1. The final iteration will arrive later this spring. Apple updates iPhones and iPads for all users, regardless of your cellphone service provider or your model. However, Apple observes a five-year horizon for updates, meaning products older than five years cannot install new updates. This is longer than for most Android devices, which update for two to three years, depending upon the manufacturer. Google updates its own products, Nexus and Pixel, for only two years. Unless you own a Google branded Nexus or Pixel, you are at the mercy of your cellphone company or hardware manufacturer for updates. Those sometimes arrive six to nine months after Google makes them available. The final version of Apple's iOS 10 not only will be the last to work on many older Apple products, but it will be the last to work with some applications (apps). Unless the app creator upgrades the app to work with iOS 11 it will cease functioning. This is the final transition from a 32-bit to full 64-bit operating system. For example, Expedia, the parent of Mobiata, the creator of the very popular app FlightBoard, ceased support of the product a couple of months ago. Besides financial considerations, it wasn't worth the effort to transform it for the new operating system. Those of you eligible for iOS 11, when it arrives late this year, should verify that your most precious apps will work with it. Update to the newest operating system, because beyond usually modest performance enhancements, the update contains important "bug fixes" and security improvements. With Apple updates, wait a week before installing, because often, Apple updates initially contain flaws that could adversely affect your product. Android issues fewer operating system updates, although like Apple, an initial release may contain bugs that need correction. Android 7.01 "Nougat" shortly superseded Nougat 7.0. While we're on the subject of Apples and Androids, Apple AirPlay and Android Auto are not created equal. Recently we heaped accolades upon Android Auto. A reader failed to feel the same love from/for Apple CarPlay. "No such joy with Apple CarPlay. For your awareness, my 2016 Honda Accord has Apple CarPlay, and I cannot stream Google Maps from iPhone 6 via Apple CarPlay. With my iPhone 6, CarPlay does not facilitate using Google Maps either in voice only mode or in voice plus display mode. From my online research, I believe this is due to Apple restrictions on all Apple CarPlay systems and not just the Apple CarPlay in my 2016 Accord and/or my iPhone 6. CarPlay is indeed a nice feature in my Accord though, as it facilitates media center touch screen control of music streaming services like Pandora, Spotify, etc. It just doesn't facilitate Google Maps. Good news, however, I am able to get my iPhone 6 to feed audio of Google Maps directions to my Accord info center via Bluetooth. After pairing my iPhone to the media center Bluetooth, I can listen to other iPhone Bluetooth-streamed music on the car speakers such as Pandora, and when the Google Maps voice direction occurs, the current music is muted and one hears the Google Maps voice direction, then the current music unmutes and continues uninterrupted after the Google Maps voice direction ends. All control of Google Maps directions, etc. stays with the iPhone." Generally, CarPlay and Android Auto require a hardwired connection for full functionality. Bluetooth wirelessly provides some features, but usually not all. Also using the car's USB connection charges the phone's battery. While Apple and Android each provide a standard template, every phone and automobile may implement it slightly differently. Check the instructions for your phone and your car to make the most of tethering your phone to your car. Rich Warren, who lives in the Champaign area, is a longtime reviewer of consumer electronics.

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 104 Share on Facebook 68 Share on Twitter Total Shares203 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Đức Thành I guess you missed the part where I said 6 smart home devices weren't any where near enough. Bring me 16 and we're talking. :D Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library. Paul Quinn I can access a single song, an album, any of my playlists, or a Google Music Playlist. I can access music from my library or from Play Music's entire catalog. I am subscribed to Google Play Music. It's possible you are seeing this if you do not have a subscription. However, you should be able to access Google's curated lists. Michael I do have the subscription. I find this really odd. Can you verify you are able to play a song that exists only in your library and not available from Play Music? How did you ask for it to be played? I have a song in my library called Alligator.MP3 as well as many others and she cannot play it. There is an entire thread on this feature not being available so I would really appreciate it if you can double check. Thanks https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/googlehome/zC9dUi3FUsk/3W6KPacnAgAJ Paul Quinn I stand corrected! It is difficult to find songs only in my library and not in GP's library but I found a couple and it will not play them on the Home. That link in the product forum has an answer that says it should work. Am I reading that wrong? It's marked as "Best Answer." Michael Well, it should work if/when Google supports it. The bad thing is they are completely mum on the subject and won't really commit on it. People who report it are being given the old "we'll send your feedback to to the developers​.". Every other Android device works as we expect it to but not Home. It will only play your playlists and that doesn't depend on the subscription.

It seems that Google has just released the stable version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat for the Nexus 6P smartphones. However, this stable version can be downloaded and installed only for the users who were on the BETA build of the mentioned Android version on their Nexus 6P devices. The latest update for the Nexus 6P has 26MB and it comes with the build number N2G47H. However, the installation file can also be downloaded from Google servers, if you can’t wait for the update to be released for your Nexus 6P via OTA. Google has not mentioned anything about the final build of Android 7.1.2 OS that was just released for the Nexus 6P, which was under BETA program until now. According to reports, the Android 7.1.2 update also includes the April Android Security patch. We remind you that the Android 7.1.2 update was released earlier this month for the Google Pixel, which has fixed some issues such as: a shutdown, a pink banding on the camera or audio popping issue that users were experiencing at high volume. In other words, for Google Pixel devices, this update has brought many bug fixes, stability improvements and new features. Some of the changes that many have noticed right after installing the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update on their devices is the improved fingerprint swipe performance, battery usage alerts and Bluetooth connectivity improvements. We have to mention that the Android 7.1.2 Nougat also brought many changes for some of the Nexus devices that have received this update. For example, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P have received improved notification stability, general connectivity improvements, battery usage alerts and fingerprint swipe. Have you installed the Android 7.1.2 Nougat (stable) on your Nexus 6P device? Tell us your thoughts about it!

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 87 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine.

Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named.

We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

He wasn't telling you to google that phrase, that is what google says when they release a new build of android. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. If it compiles, it's ready. No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices.

And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones !

Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them?

My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor. "Genius" store crooks said I needed a new hard drive and wanted $150. Bought a $20 cable from ebay, watched a few videos and fixed it. Running fine 3 years later. Apple has known about this issue since 2007 but has never acknkowledged it. My Pro cost me more than 1400. I have had sub 500 Windows laptops easily run 5 years.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 133 Plus 1 on G+ 291 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares505 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 3 [Deal Alert] Staples has the Lenovo ThinkPad Chromebook 11e for $140 ($210 off) 2017/04/16 1:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] The first episode of Doctor Who season 10, plus the first episode of Class (a spinoff), are free on Google Play 2017/04/16 8:33am PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Guest Apprenticeships could solve tech’s diversity problem Sylvain Kalache, Holberton School@SylvainKalache April 16, 2017 10:25 AM Tags: Airbnb, apprentice, apprenticeships, Donald Trump, Google, Howard University, Howard West, Marc Benioff, Salesforce Image Credit: Shutterstock In case you missed it, Howard University and Google recently announced that they were partnering to attract more African American students to study computer science, targeting a segment of the tech population that is notoriously underrepresented (along with women). The Google/Howard partnership is a small step (albeit an important one) with a specific goal — to bring more people of color into the tech workforce. The industry is truly missing out on a lot of great talent. However, the fact is that only by changing the way we recruit, inspire, and educate (train) students from the outdated “lecture and regurgitate” mode to a more progressive model, where students learn practical skills and improve their problem solving and collaboration skills via hands-on projects, can we hope to begin filling all the jobs now and in the future. Google’s step follows a series of moves by corporations, wealthy individuals, and entrepreneurs to attract more talent to the tech industry. Paul Allen donated $40 million to the University of Washington’s computer science department, while Boeing awarded $6 million in grants to reinforce STEM education in Washington. Last year, SalesForce CEO Marc Benioff announced that SalesForce donated $8.5 million to San Francisco Unified School District and $2.5 million to Oakland Unified School District to hire STEM teachers, as well as buying the computer systems they need. Businesses need more skilled STEM workers. There are a quarter-million job openings for software developers in the U.S. alone and half a million unfilled jobs that require tech skills — and the forecast predicts 2.4 million unfilled STEM jobs by 2018. If you take a closer look at our education system, it’s immediately apparent that little has really changed since the 19th century, when the standard methodology was to get the rural population ready to work in factories. While this type of education fits some people and institutions, it does not favor everyone. And, more often than not, those not favored are branded as failures or see themselves as failures. In fact, it’s the cookie cutter methodology developed more than a century ago that continues to fail them. Since the tech industry requires a diverse and qualified pool of workers, it wants to bring alternative, and specifically, more practical, training back to the table. Benioff, who is actively investing in Bay Area education, now aims to take his ideas national. He recently ensured that his new moonshot — to get the U.S. government to create five million apprenticeship opportunities within the next five years — was right on track. He met with President Trump, who agreed his request made sense. If this initiative does happen, it might drastically change the U.S. job market, which currently only has half a million apprentices. And the initiative follows a trend: Microsoft recently announced an apprenticeship program to train the next generation of software engineers, which aligns with its commitment to train 30,000 new apprentices by 2020. Airbnb started a similar program last year, explaining that the company would build better products if its team was as diverse as the community it serves. Learning by doing, which has been considered for decades as the only way for tradespeople to develop skills, is gaining converts. Often associated with blue collar jobs, its practices are well-suited to the STEM fields, especially engineering, which represents a big part of current white collar jobs. “Apprenticeship has proven to be very efficient in countries like Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, which have among the lowest youth unemployment rates in the world,“ says Kristin Keveloh, head of strategic partnership at the Global Apprenticeships Network. “While the term ‘apprenticeship’ does not have a good reputation elsewhere, the model forms an essential part of the education and training landscape in these countries, and I increasingly see corporate and government leaders discovering this model as great training for the next generation of workers.” Apprenticeships, progressive education, and vocational training get students to a level of proficiency and experience that makes them productive on the job from the start. Additionally, it brings to the table people who have not been drilled in the rote learning methodology most Universities use. “One big issue that we have with standard college education is the lack of focus on practical knowledge,” says Neha Jain, senior software engineer at LinkedIn. “Students who realize this limitation and start working on side projects or contributing to open source end up doing better. Spending time honing the craft of writing good code is greatly more valuable than trying to learn theory only.” Initiatives like the Google-Howard University partnership and Salesforce’s push for alternative education will help grow and foster diversity in the tech industry.  And it’s encouraging to see that tech can count President Trump as an unexpected ally in its quest for apprenticeships. Who knows, perhaps President Trump and his administration might actually help make America (and the tech industry) great again.

About us Our staff Contacts Home Business Health Science Tech World Samsung Galaxy S8 won’t launch with Bixby Voice feature April 16, 2017 Paul Smedley Leave a comment Samsung proudly announced it’s new AI assistant Bixby at the official launch of the Galaxy S8 smartphone last month. However, the voice activation capability, the headline feature of Samsung’s rival to Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google’s Assistant, won’t be available in the USA until “later this spring“. At launch, Bixby will be available in the United States (albeit without the ability to use voice commands) and South Korea. Later, Microsoft entered the game with its own version of an intelligent personal assistant – Cortana and past year Google went full throttle with its AI-powered Google Assistant which was initially only available to Pixel devices. Bixby has been pitched as major feature in the Galaxy S8, with a dedicated button on the left hand side of the device. Samsung plans to add Bixby Voice support to the GS8 “later this spring”. Samsung said that the voice control update would arrive later this spring. Needless to say, it basically helps you set reminders using Bixby. After coming in behind Apple during the fourth quarter of a year ago, Samsung grabbed the top spot in global smartphone market share in the first quarter of 2017, according to a report released today by the Taiwan-based market research firm TrendForce. As confirmed by Axios by a Samsung representative, it seems that Samsung will not be launching Bixby Voice with the Galaxy S8. Will you buy Galaxy S8 despite the limitations with Bixby voice feature? Samsung said that both of its new flagship phones have garnered a record number of pre-orders. Next to its very visible “Infinity Display”, the Galaxy S8’s headline feature is Bixby. Both the applications are only supported on Samsung phones, leading to the theory that the Android 7.1 Nougat update is now under testing. “The company will boost marketing and sales efforts with the latest Galaxy S8 model for the second quarter”. However, the report attributed most of Samsung’s strong performance to its low-end and mid-range smartphones, rather than its premium devices.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 87 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball.

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs.

John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update. I have a Verizon Pixel XL Necronos Yeah, sometimes it doesn't wanna read my finger, really annoying and sometimes I have to reboot. Nope.jpeg If you are reading this, set you Disqus profile to private, if you'd like. I just found out today that it's available. EvilHowl That has been availiable since years Nope.jpeg >I just found out today that it's available. I meant that I just discovered it today. 7-down But it has been there for years! bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/65fbb30db9562d2071d7be874cf7e6b0b6724c0c6b0333a36a817e13eef2bd99.gif Kougeru Thanks tigerstown Another so called pixel issue and yet I have never had one that's been reported. It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices.

And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones !

My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor.

 Inside Mark Zuckerberg's controversial decision to turn down Yahoo's $1 billion early offer to buy Facebook Mike Hoefflinger Apr. 16, 2017, 12:00 PM 19,065 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook This is an excerpt from the book “Becoming Facebook” by Mike Hoefflinger. It’s the inside story of Facebook told by the former Head of Global Business Marketing, chronicling the 10 major decisions Facebook made that led from their disastrous stock drop in 2012 to one of the biggest companies in the world. This section comes from the chapter “How Facebook Turned Down 1 Billion”, and discusses how what made Mark Zuckerberg turn down what was ( at the time) a substantial buyout.   In the summer of 2009, Silicon Valley’s (and my) past met its (and my) future. I had worked at Intel from 1992 to 2008 and directly for former CEO Andy Grove from 1999 to 2001. In January 2009, I had moved to working at Facebook after interviewing with its business and engineering leaders as well as with Sandberg and Zuckerberg. When I had reached out to both Grove and Zuckerberg to see whether they’d be interested in connecting with each other over lunch, both agreed. We found ourselves sitting at one of the outdoor tables on the small patio behind Facebook’s eclectic building adjacent to a Palo Alto neighborhood at the top of South California Avenue. The 50-year-old landmark, affectionately known inside Facebook simply by its street number—1601—and home to the entire company for a brief period prior to the 2011 move into its much larger and ever growing campus in nearby Menlo Park, has since been leveled to make room for larger buildings, dissociating our memories of navigating privacy crises, building client relationships, achieving unprecedented growth and surviving existential competition with Google from the place where we lived them. Grove was the 72-year-old Silicon Valley legend. Cofounder, CEO and chairman of Intel, the company that more than any other gave the Valley its name and whose microprocessors were responsible for enabling personal computing and cost-effective servers and, with them, the Internet. When Silicon Valley talks about building on the shoulders of giants, it’s Grove’s shoulders we’re talking about. His passing in March 2016 was the end of a world-altering era. Zuckerberg was the 25-year-old ascendant newcomer building services at a scale and speed only possible because of Grove’s legacy. It was a meeting of the veteran who had made possible a billion connected computers and the rookie on his way to connecting the billion people on those computers. In the early stages of the conversation, the two circled slowly and respectfully in shallow waters. Grove trying to determine the legitimacy—his bar was notoriously high—of his lunch companion, something I had seen him do in dozens of one-on-one meetings a decade earlier with the likes of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Yahoo’s Jerry Yang, Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, eBay’s Meg Whitman and LoudCloud’s Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz (now better known as the venture capital firm a16z). Zuckerberg, in turn, was looking to find common ground with Grove, the statesman who had jumped off the pages of the management bible Only the Paranoid Survive—a must-read for self-respecting technology l-eaders—and who now sat in front of him. A few minutes in, Grove made his move. A direct question meant not to disrespect or trivialize but to penetrate to a more interesting place for both of them: “How did you turn down Yahoo’s $1 billion?” Yahoo's $1 Billion Thomson Reuters Grove’s question deserves a quick refresher of the circumstances to which he was referring. Much has been made of the what-could-have-been acquisition offers for Facebook in its early years. Between 2004 and 2007, a string of suitors including Friendster, Google, The Washington Post, Viacom, MySpace, News Corp, Viacom again, NBC, Viacom a third time, Yahoo, AOL, Yahoo again, Google again and Microsoft were rumored to have made acquisition overtures of one kind or another to Facebook. The most talked-about was Yahoo’s offer in June 2006, said to have initially been worth $1 billion. Venture capitalist and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, the earliest outside Facebook investor and formerly key player at PayPal, recalled the July 2006 Facebook board meeting between him, fellow venture capitalist Jim Breyer and the then 22-year-old Zuckerberg, held to discuss the 10-figure offer at a time when Facebook was barely two years old and had only eight to nine million users and $20 million in revenue:  Both Breyer and myself on balance thought we probably should take the money and run. But, Zuckerberg started the meeting like, “This is kind of a formality, just a quick board meeting, it shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. We’re obviously not going to sell here.” Zuckerberg’s argument was that there were all these things we were going to build at Facebook, and he wanted to have a chance to build those products [Facebook was about to open beyond colleges and launch the News Feed]. [Yahoo] had no definite idea about the future. They did not properly value things that did not yet exist. They were, therefore, undervaluing the business. With a decade of Facebook success behind us, we can recognize Zuckerberg’s decision as prescient (judging by 2016 levels, Yahoo undervalued Facebook by more than 300 times). At the time, however, the young CEO and his board were widely questioned and publicly derided. Willpower Scott Olson / Getty Images It was that very derision that had prompted Grove to ask the question: “How did you turn down Yahoo’s $1 billion?” Even in 2009, three years after passing up the acquisition, it was still a defining—and possibly touchy—question since Zuckerberg’s decision had not yet been fully vindicated. Facebook’s valuation, which had run up to $15 billion in 2008 with Chinese investor Li Ka-Shing’s $120 million investment, had declined by as much as 80% to $3.1 billion in the lightly traded private secondary exchange earlier in 2009. Facebook had only just crossed 200 million monthly users globally and was still neck-and-neck with MySpace in the United States. Its eventual $100 billion IPO three years later was not yet a gleam in anyone’s eye. Zuckerberg recognized, however, that Grove was not asking the question in its judgmental form but rather with genuine interest in Zuckerberg’s process. He answered it in that spirit. “I just thought we could do it,” he said, referring to growing to a much larger scale and eventually becoming a successful public company with much greater valuation. While Zuckerberg’s answer may seem arrogant on paper—especially in the context of talking to someone who had done what Zuckerberg was still far from accomplishing—Grove saw there was in Zuckerberg no artifice, no arrogance and no lack of understanding of the difficulties that still lay ahead. In that answer, one visionary CEO with willpower recognized another across a chasm of nearly two generations. There was—at that moment—no difference between the two, as the torch passed viscerally from one Silicon Valley era to another. As a footnote to the moment, Zuckerberg would carry that torch forward to being named Time magazine’s Person of the Year the following year (an honor Grove had received in 1997), and by 2016, Facebook’s valuation would go on to eclipse the highest ever reached by Grove’s Intel in 2000 (not adjusting for inflation). Curious, Grove followed up: “Where does that willpower come from?” Zuckerberg considered the question—possibly for the first time—and concluded simply, “Jewish mother.” From "Becoming Facebook” by Mike Hoefflinger, Copyright © 2017 by Mike Hoefflinger.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « California DMV Lists Apple as one of 30 Permitted to Conduct Autonomous Car Road Tests | Main | A Major Warner Bros. Patent Reveals a Coming AR/VR Movie Delivery System for Theaters, Home systems & Headsets » April 16, 2017 What's the Game Plan for the Ever Aggressive Foxconn?   Last year Foxconn acquired Sharp (one and two) and pushed hard to reinvent the company to quickly tool up to make OLED displays for Apple's iPhones as one of it's new products. In January we learned of Foxconn/Sharp's plan to manufacture OLED displays at an iPhone plant in China. We also learned that Foxconn/Sharp was aiming to grab some of Apple's iPhone camera lens business and that they were given the green light to test wireless charging modules for Apple's top end iPhones for 2017. Foxconn's Chairman also dropped the hammer on Samsung and stopped their LCD business with Samsung who was in a panic to find a replacement and eventually had to deal with their arch rival LG for LCDs. Those were just some of Foxconn's noteworthy activities in 2016.   To kick off 2017 we learned that Foxconn was a known investor in Andy Rubin's new smartphone venture. Google's Eric Schmidt sat on Apple's board during the crucial years prior to the iPhone's launch wherein Schmidt was privy to developments of the iPhone while at the same time Google was backing Andy Rubin's Android OS to compete with Apple's revolutionary iPhone. Wasn't that a direct conflict of Interest that Schmidt should have told Steve Jobs about? Yes, of course but he didn't. Schmidt played Judas to Jobs. So Andy Rubin's new smartphone company called "Essential Products Inc" is no friend to Apple. The "Essential" smartphone is rumored to be ready to launch prior to Apple's World Wide Developer Conference. Foxconn is backing this company and is likely to manufacture the new smartphone.   Foxconn manufactures a lot of devices that compete with Apple, but this is different because Foxconn has taken a stake in the company. Wouldn't it be in Foxconn's interest to let Rubin in on Apple's latest product developments to better help Essential compete with future Apple iPhones? Is Foxconn really getting into the camera lens for Apple or Essential? Is Foxconn really working on wireless modules for Apple or Essential? Considering that we learned that Apple has been working with Broadcom on a wireless charing solution for two years, why would Foxconn get the nod for charging modules?   Apple has a great relationship with Foxconn and it's chairman Terry Gou. Patently Apple posted a report in December covering Tim Cook's visit to Shenzhen back in October. Foxconn's Founder and Chairman Terry Gou accompanied Cook to meet Chairman Xu Shaoshi of China's National Development and Reform Commission and other senior Shenzhen officials. Apple's new facility will be in the same city as the new ARM chip design center. So it appears that Foxconn and Apple are tied at the hip.   I think most of us realize that the press and rumors get some interesting facts but could be slightly inaccurate in the finer details. The report that Foxconn was an investor in Essential was an alert to say the least. But the Foxconn's connection to Essential may have been a little off course.   In March Patently Apple posted a report titled "Politics Likely Played a Role in Softbank's Decision to Back Off their Investment in a new Apple Rival Led by Andy Rubin." Our report covered the Wall Street Journal's report stating that "SoftBank Group Corp. scrapped a planned $100 million investment in a smartphone startup founded by the creator of Google's Android software, partly because of the Japanese investor's increasingly close relationship with Apple Inc., according to people familiar with the matter." Was Foxconn personally involved via the potential SoftBank investment or are they still invested in Essential?"   Yet no matter how you look at it, it sounds like Apple caught wind of this investment, forcing SoftBank to pull out. It's a political game that we'll never know the exact details of, but it's a little troubling.   Today we're learning of another venture that Foxconn is pushing with a questionable twist. The Nikkei is reporting that Foxconn/Sharp is mulling reentry into the PC market.   The Nikkei reports that "The Japanese electronics manufacturer is weighing the possibility of selling PCs and other devices made by its Taiwanese parent, Hon Hai Precision Industry, under the Sharp brand."   The twist is Sharp's President Tai Jeng-wu adding that they had "no plans of restarting its smartphone business." Yet if Hon Hai is willing to back a plan for Sharp to reenter a shrinking or dying market, wouldn't smartphones be next?   Is Foxconn's connection to the new Essential smartphone a possible clue that Foxconn has bigger plans for the new smartphone – as in getting Sharp to become a major partner backing it? Wouldn't that be a way for Foxconn to get more smartphone manufacturing business so that their reliance on Apple is reduced?   The ever aggressive Foxconn is a major Apple partner, but recent moves into wireless charging and camera lenses and the likely link to an investment in Essential is enough to make anyone wonder if Foxconn could one day pull-off another shocker like they did with their one-time partner Samsung for LCD displays. One moment Samsung was a major customer and, without warning, Foxconn left them stranded. If you're an Apple fan that could have been a humorous moment if not ballsy, but what if Foxconn ever pulled that off against Apple? I don't think we'd find it funny in the least.   At the moment, Apple-Foxconn is like Lennon-McCartney. They're teams that you think could never breakup. But the inconceivable happened and it was a nasty breakup for the Beatles. I now have to wonder if Foxconn has a longer game plan in mind that doesn't involve Apple at all. And when you think about it, if a trade war ever broke out between China and the U.S. Apple would be one of the top U.S. companies that would be hit which would put Foxconn at great risk. So even as a back-up plan, Foxconn has to be ready for any surprising developments, because in the end, business is business.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical.

I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel.

Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh.

New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything.

The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already.

I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even.

But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down. There is no workaround for it so far other than to just press once and then it will start working. Adam Margeson Not sure what you're talking about. Doesn't seem to affect my Pixel. dontsh00tmesanta Guess I'm a lucky one mine is ok abc Premium bugs for your "premium" Pixel. mike shwilly No issues here. Not using fingerprint sensor at all though.

Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here. My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor. "Genius" store crooks said I needed a new hard drive and wanted $150. Bought a $20 cable from ebay, watched a few videos and fixed it. Running fine 3 years later. Apple has known about this issue since 2007 but has never acknkowledged it. My Pro cost me more than 1400. I have had sub 500 Windows laptops easily run 5 years. Apple products(ipad excluded) are nice looking pieces of shit.

Early Jr. on April 15 said authorities have arrested a man suspected of killing Vanessa Marcotte, a Google employee, in August. (Reuters) Authorities have arrested a man suspected of killing Vanessa Marcotte, a 27-year-old Google employee who went out for a jog one afternoon and never came back. Angelo Colon-Ortiz, 31, has been charged with aggravated assault and battery and assault with attempt to rape, Worcester County District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr. announced Saturday. Early told reporters during a news conference that a murder charge is expected to be filed. “We got him,” Early told reporters, according to the Associated Press. “We’re very comfortable that we’ve got Vanessa Marcotte’s killer.” This undated driver’s license photo shows Vanessa Marcotte, whose body was found Aug. 7 in a wooded area in Princeton, Mass. (Worcester County District Attorney’s Office via AP) The arrest comes eight months after Marcotte’s body was found about half a mile from her mother’s house in Princeton, Mass., where she was visiting for the weekend. The health-care account manager for Google was last seen about 1 p.m. Aug. 7. Massachusetts State Police K-9 teams discovered her body in a wooded area later that night, the Boston Globe reported. [Google’s Vanessa Marcotte, visiting family in Mass., went for a jog — and never came back] Investigators have received more than 1,300 tips from the public, but a break in the case happened after a state police trooper spotted a dark sport-utility vehicle driven by a man who matched the suspect’s description, according to the district attorney’s office. The trooper wrote the license plate number on his hand and later tracked down the man’s address. The trooper went to the man’s home in Worcester, Mass., not far from Princeton. There, Colon-Ortiz provided the officer with a DNA sample, the district attorney’s office said. The DNA matched a sample taken from Marcotte’s hands. Police believe that Marcotte fought her attacker, scratching his face, neck and arms, the AP reported. “It’s through her determined fight and her efforts that we obtained the DNA of her killer,” Early told reporters. Colon-Ortiz is being held on a $10 million bail and will have his first court hearing on Tuesday. [She went for a jog and never came home. Six months later, police may have found her killer.] Numerous local outlets — including the Boston Globe, the Telegram and Gazette and Boston’s ABC affiliate — cited police sources as saying there are indications that Marcotte’s body was burned. Marcotte’s Instagram feed depicted someone who loved the New England Patriots, Boston and the beach. She died about a year and a half after she started a job at Google in New York. A Google spokesman had confirmed Marcotte’s employment in an emailed statement to The Washington Post. “Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work, and love of Boston sports,” the statement said. “We are deeply shocked and saddened and our thoughts are with her family and friends.” According to her LinkedIn profile, Marcotte graduated from Boston University in 2011, stayed in the Boston area for several years and worked at WordStream, an online advertising company, and Vistaprint.

Google Maps will no longer allow users to suggest edits and make revisions on the map database via Google Map Maker. Since 2008, maps could be updated with valuable local knowledge such as when building or construction changes were made, ensuring maps were kept fresh, accurate and up-to-date. Because the edit function was open to all users, all suggestions had to be moderated as it was regularly abused. However, that has all changed. Due to the sheer volume of suggestions, the task of moderating each one was enormous, and proved to be too large. Google released a statement explaining their decision: "Since 2008, the Google Map Make community has edited and moderated millions of features to improve the Google Maps experience. READ MORE: Don't say 108 to Siri on your iPhone, it could bring you nothing but trouble "To make it easier for all Google Maps users to contribute changes to the map, we've started to graduate functionality from Map Maker to Google Maps on both desktop and mobile. We'll continue to add new editing features within Google Maps on an ongoing basis. "To keep contributing your local knowledge to Google Maps and engage with a passionate community of like-minded individuals, we invite you to join the Local Guides program."

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 133 Plus 1 on G+ 291 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares505 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 3 [Deal Alert] Staples has the Lenovo ThinkPad Chromebook 11e for $140 ($210 off) 2017/04/16 1:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] The first episode of Doctor Who season 10, plus the first episode of Class (a spinoff), are free on Google Play 2017/04/16 8:33am PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Google Family Link Now Lets iPhone Users Monitor Their Kid’s Android Device By Ali Salman Apr 15, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google introduced its new Family Link app last month. The parental control software allows parents to monitor their kids with Android devices. However, the app was only available on Android, which means that parents with an iPhone did not have this option available. This is now changed as the company has updated the app to work on iOS devices. Let’s dive in to see some more details on the new Google Family Link app on iPhone. Google Family Link Lets Parents Monitor Your Kid’s Android Device If you’re yet not familiar with the Family Link app, it allows parents to perform a bevy of functions in their  kid’s Android device. For instance, you can approve or block app download, block installed apps and also provides parents with weekly or monthly reports. In addition to this, Family Link also allows parents to lock their kid’s Android device by setting a “bedtime” lock. Apart from this, parents also set time restrictions and view what apps is your kid using. Related Here’s An Easy Way To Peek At The Status Bar In Fullscreen Apps On iOS 10 Family Link unlocks the door to Google’s broad ecosystem of services, while helping you to: • Manage the apps your kids can use – Approve or block the apps your kid wants to download from the Google Play store. Advertisement • Keep an eye on screen time – See how much time your kid spends on their favorite apps with weekly or monthly activity reports, and set daily screen time limits. Related Easter Weekend Sale: 8 Paid iOS Apps Gone Free – Download them All • Set device bedtime – Remotely lock your kid’s device when it’s time for bed, or time to take a break. At this point, the child’s smartphone must be powered by Android Nougat or higher. However, there are a few devices running Marshmallow that can also take advantage of Google Family Link app. In terms of configuring the app, you  have to create a Google account within the app that can be used to control or monitor the Android device. Google’s Family Link is definitely a great app if you’re interested in keeping an eye on your kids and their activities. Now that the app is available on iOS, iPhone users can take advantage of it as well. However, the only drawback is that the kid must have an Android device at this point. Probably in the near future, Google will update the app in favor of iOS devices on the receiving end. This is it for  now, folks. What are your thought on the Google Family Link app?

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 133 Plus 1 on G+ 291 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares505 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 3 [Deal Alert] Staples has the Lenovo ThinkPad Chromebook 11e for $140 ($210 off) 2017/04/16 1:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] The first episode of Doctor Who season 10, plus the first episode of Class (a spinoff), are free on Google Play 2017/04/16 8:33am PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

By Hayley Tsukayama, the Washington Post Apr 13, 2017 at 3:23 pm | Print View A Burger King ad designed to trigger Google’s voice-activated Home smart speaker and have the device advertise the Whopper no longer works. The ad, released Wednesday, features an actor dressed as a Burger King employee, who says, “OK, Google: What is the Whopper burger?” The line is meant to trigger the device to reel off the definition of a Whopper using the first line of the burger’s Wikipedia page. (Yes, the Whopper has its own Wikipedia page.) Roughly three hours after the ad launched, the ad stopped working. Google’s Home would only light up in response to the commercial’s prompt and stay mum (although it will give you the first line of the Wikipedia article if you explicitly request the definition of a “Whopper burger”). The fast-food company confirmed that the ad no longer triggers the speaker, but it said that it will still air the ad - and indicated that the ad may start working again. “You’ll have to tune in tonight to see if the commercial triggers the Whopper sandwich definition response,” said Burger King spokesman Brooke Scher Mogan. Mogan said Burger King saw the ad as an opportunity to “do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices.” Google did not respond to requests for comment. A person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record said the fast-food chain did not consult Google before making the commercial. While commercials - often those about home hubs - have accidentally triggered voice assistants in people’s homes before, this seems to be the first time an ad has tried to do it intentionally. Based on comments on the ad’s YouTube page, many consumers did not appreciate having their devices hijacked. “When you take over someones phone or tablet and have it do your own remote commands intentionally, you are HACKING,” read one comment. In fact, it may be a blessing for Burger King that the ad no longer works as intended because the advertisement almost immediately backfired on the fast-food chain. Once the ad started gaining attention, Wikipedia users began altering the first line of the article about Burger King’s Whopper. These edits included references to the burger as “cancer-causing” and stating that its ingredients include “cyanide.” It appears that Burger King itself tried to fix the Wikipedia problem. The first sentence changed to a suspiciously glowing description of the Whopper, authored by user “Fermachado123” - a name that sounds similar to Fernando Machado, Burger King’s senior vice president for global brand management. Burger King did not confirm or deny that Machado edited the article. Privacy concerns about voice-activated speakers and the connected home have been on the rise as more companies have introduced these products, putting pressure on the makers of voice-operated security systems and door locks to ensure that their devices can’t be triggered by unauthorized voices. The place of advertising on the Google Home and similar products has been thoroughly debated by users as they have become more commonplace. Many users don’t want to be spammed with ads delivered by what they consider personal assistants. Google subjected itself to criticism after Home users heard what appeared to be an unprompted plug for Disney’s “Beauty and Beast” when the film opened last month. Google said at the time that mentioning the film wasn’t meant to be an ad but simply a notice to users about what was timely that day, according to a statement provided to CNET. “We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case,” a Google spokesman said.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Photos Update 2.13 for Android Brings Support for Video Stabilization By Zara Ali Apr 12, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Photos can conveniently be tagged among Google’s best services. And with every update, it is only getting better. The tech giant has rolled out update 2.13 to Google Photos, which brings video stabilization for videos that are already recorded. In addition to the stabilization feature, the update also hints at some upcoming features. In a report, AndroidPolice points out that the video stabilization had been there for quite some time, but it was not active. With the update 2.13, Google has made the feature active for all. Related Google Is Developing A New Social App For Small Groups To Share And Edit Photos Together Video stabilization on Google Photos is an easy-to-use feature. To get started, you have to open a video, tap on edit and then select “stabilize.” After selecting the option, Google Photos will stabilize your video frame-by-frame. Notably, the stabilization takes as much time as the duration of the video, and it also depends on the resolution, frame rate, along with the processing speed of your device. It means that this feature would work better on flagship devices in comparison to mid-rangers. Advertisement To stabilize the videos, Google Photos lightly crops and warps the video to keep the subject immovable. In most of the videos, the outcome shows no warp effect but in some videos, you might notice a slight warping effect. In addition to introducing a new feature, the update 2.13 also leaves hints for the return of Google+ app integration with the service. It will ultimately allow photo sharing on circles in Google+ via Google Photos. How ironical is it that Google Photos was launched as a part of Google+ and it went on to become way more popular than Google’s flop social network. Another irony is that before the launch, Google+ was being promoted as the “Facebook Killer,” Alas, things turned out the other way round or perhaps vice-versa. The update 2.13 for Google Photos is currently rolling on Google Play, and Google is expected to initiate the rollout for Android user in the coming days.

Repairing the largest 20% of leaks could cut emissions in half. Megan Geuss - Apr 16, 2017 2:00 pm UTC Steve Harwood reader comments 32 Share this story Researchers from Colorado State University have been working with Google Street View to map pervasive natural-gas leaks. These leaks come from pipes that can be buried three-to-four feet below city streets. Many of the millions of miles of piping that deliver natural gas locally to urban and suburban homes are decades old—in some cases piping can be more than a century old. Older pipes can be made of cast-iron or bare steel, and they are often corroded or broken in places. But because they’re buried and because natural gas is invisible, it’s hard to tell when a pipe is leaking underneath a sidewalk. Sometimes, digging up and replacing a pipe isn’t worthwhile for the utility that owns it if the leaks isn’t an immediate risk to life and limb. Besides the occasional explosion, there’s not much of a health risk associated with small natural-gas leaks. But natural gas is mostly comprised of methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas. Although carbon dioxide sticks around in the atmosphere longer than methane does, it’s much more potent at warming the Earth in the short term than carbon dioxide. That should make fixing the aging, leaking pipes under our cities a municipal priority. Although utilities will sometimes send employees out to neighborhoods to measure gas leaks from their pipes, they’re not always keen to share that data with citizens or even researchers. Even if utility workers are willing to share, making a complete census of all the leaks can be challenging. But the CSU researchers wanted to see if they could make getting that information to the public easier, and last month they published a paper in Environmental Science and Technology. Recent years have seen the advent of cheaper, more portable gas analyzers from companies like Picarro, Los Gatos Research, and LI-COR. The lead author of the paper, Joe von Fischer, told Ars in a phone call that his team's aim was to attach these kinds of analyzers to cars and find a statistical method for weeding out leaks from non-leaks. Google Street View cars were perfect because they had a primary job (mapping), and adding high-precision methane sensors to them required no extra work on the part of Google's driver—and that cuts down on necessary resources. Google and CSU have been running this project for several years now. They’ve shared some of the data from the first cities they surveyed with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), which made all of their results accessible via interactive maps. Boston, Staten Island, and Syracuse show some of the most leak-prone piping due to corroded distribution lines. Those cities leaked 25 times more methane than cities like Burlington, Vermont, and Indianapolis, Indiana, where natural gas pipes have been upgraded more recently. Mapping the invisible The researchers’ paper mentions that, although they had the cooperation of many utilities in their mapping project, better data is needed for this critical part of city infrastructure. “[T]here is no mandate for leak surveys to quantify leak rates [or] make such spatially explicit data available to the public,” the paper notes. But if mapping the largest natural-gas leaks in your neighborhood is easy, you can push your local representatives to help utilities fix them. How they did it The CSU team outfitted three 2012 Subaru Outback Imprezas from Google’s fleet with methane analyzers in the front bumper. The sensor information was sent to a system in the car that also gathered GPS data to match the methane readings with vehicle location and speed. A sensor to gather wind speed and direction was also included. Then the researchers did a series of test runs and determined that their system could estimate leaks accurately at distances less than 20m (or 65 ft) away. Leaks 10m (33 ft) away were estimated with greatest accuracy. Measuring leaks also means coming up with an accurate way to measure background CH4 emissions levels, which are present in every city. In previous surveys of methane leaks, 2.5 parts per million (ppm) of CH4 was considered a good threshold for finding a leak in an urban area, but the CSU researchers found a fixed threshold to be inadequate. “CH4 levels were highly variable within and among cities and in time,” they wrote, which made comparing leaks difficult. Instead, the researchers opted to define local baseline methane emissions as an average over a two-minute window driving at approximately 40kph (25 mph). Leaks were identified as any methane reading more than than 10 percent, or more than one Standard Deviation, above that average (whichever measurement was greater). Once they figured out how to account for background methane emissions, the researchers also threw out all data collected when the car was moving faster than 70kph (or about 44mph). This was done because spacial information (the distance between the sensor and the leak) degraded beyond that speed. It was also done because natural gas vehicles, especially trucks, are more likely to share the roads with the Google Street View cars driving at those speeds, which could potentially throw off the readings. Then probable leaks were pinpointed by doing multiple passes down the same roads. Datapoints that had been identified as possible leaks but didn’t show up after a second pass were thrown out. The more times a leak was identified after every pass, the more confident the researchers were that this was, in fact, a leak. They aimed for two to five passes down every road they measured. If the CSU researchers were only interested in measuring leaks for utilities, they could have stopped there. But getting the information out to the public was also a goal, so they sought out studies in science communication. They decided that, to maximize the “usefulness of the leak magnitude information,” they’d have to classify leaks as small, medium, or large. This helped the EDF build the interactive sites you can find today. What the data tell us The researchers admit in their paper that their measurements were conservative and their results aren’t a full census of all the leaks in a particular area. But the largest leaks are identified, and the researchers estimated that repairing the largest 20 percent of leaks could cut methane emissions from natural gas pipelines in half. von Fischer told Ars that this research is only part of the story of natural gas emissions from local lines. “We don’t want utilities to abandon the walking leak surveys that they do,” he said. Instead, his team wants to democratize information about methane leaks. Even if the leaks don’t pose an immediate health threat, neighborhoods could take control of their greenhouse gas emissions with this information. The broader accuracy of the Google Street View system was reflected in the fact that cities with an accelerated pipeline replacement program (APRP) had far fewer identified leaks than cities that do not. “The APRP cities of Burlington, Vermont, and Indianapolis, Indiana, registered 11 and five leaks, respectively, while we found hundreds or thousands of leaks in the non-APRP cities of Boston, Staten Island, and Syracuse,” the researchers wrote. Finding a fast way to quantify the largest leaks in a city will give municipal leaders a way to prioritize their spending on the areas that need it most. Environmental Science and Technology, 2017.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

Google Photos' video stabilization gets demoed, proves impressive Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/04/13 3:47am PDTApr 13, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 149 Share on Facebook 67 Share on Twitter Total Shares251 Applications Apps/Games News Videos Yesterday, we found out in a teardown that version 2.13 of the Google Photos app brings video stabilization. This is a welcome addition, of course, as nobody enjoys watching shaky footage, but how well does it work? Thanks to some comparison videos that were shared on the net, we can now see that it's pretty damn impressive. Several examples are shared in this Google Photos album (we can't embed Photos videos, unfortunately). As is probably evident, the unedited videos are on the left, while the stabilized ones are to the right. The difference is pretty drastic in the three skiing videos, as well as the video of the Gear S3 Frontier at the end (nice watch, by the way). Although you do sacrifice a bit of quality, that's inevitable when you're dealing with this type of stabilization. We also get a glimpse of how it compares with YouTube's stabilization via this YouTube playlist, and the Photos-edited video is far, far better. It doesn't even look like YouTube did anything when you view it side-by-side with the Photos video. Compare both of those clips to this completely unedited one. The difference between the Photos-stabilized video and the YouTube-stabilized video isn't much different that that between the Photos video and the unedited one. Take a page from the Photos team, YouTube. It's gotta be pretty good if it's yielded a comment like this from the Jolly Swagman. Well done, Google. And feel free to continue adding to Photos' already-long list of features.

Here's the video without stabilisation on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIQ0BoLLKVg LethalLunatic does it crop the video from let's say 4k to something like 1080P? whispy_snippet Image stabilisation will crop a little but certainly not to this extent. You'd have to be throwing your arms from above your head down to your toes and back again to necessitate this! catalysto There are some reports that it does indeed convert 4K videos to 1080p. Clearly, that's not just from the stabilization, but it might be happening nonetheless. Also, someone else said 1080p stabilized videos remain 1080p, so they resize them after crop to maintain original resolution. Interesting. bobEveryman Maybe the amount of detail lost when stabilizing a 4k video would render it not much better than a 1080p, so why not downsize it, type of thing... pfmiller A few percent trimmed off the edge of the video isn't going to hurt the resolution that much. Cody Toombs I would guess that it's downsizing to accommodate for limitations of running on a smartphone. The processing time isn't great with longer 1080p video, so it might be twinkle with 4K. Likewise, there is the issue of storage space, which runs out really fast with 4K footage. James Mauger Isn't it due to the free photos backup auto downscaling to 1080? catalysto Possibly. But that doesn't make sense if the video hasn't been uploaded to the cloud yet. Gailpgregory I've made $84,000 so far this year working online and I'm a full time student. I’m using an online business opportunity I heard about and I've made such great money. It's really user friendly and I'm just so happy that I found out about it. The potential with this is endless. Here’s what I do !wr250c: ➽➽ ➽➽➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs250OfficeStudio/GetPaid$97/Hour... ★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫:::!wr250u:......... Dimitris Kanellopoulos Unfortunately anything higher than 1080p gets with or without cropping down to 1080p. Regardless the original quality backup. The produced file after stabilization is done is always 1080p. That sucks. I loved to record 4k for the detail on static environment and I hope stabilization would help. YouTube's stabilization does not do this J_Pod It's pretty good, I've only noticed that in some cases it'll give a weird wibble wobble effect of you jerk the camera left and right a short distance quickly in the original recording. Making everything stretch and bend funny and look cartoonish for a quick second. Irwin What happened to the archive feature that was mentioned maybe a month ago? brkshr I haven't heard of this, but I would really like that. Trying to find a picture among thousands of others sucks. I don't want to delete half my pictures, but I could certainly archive half of them. Cody Toombs A lot of the stuff that turns up in a teardown can sit for months before it goes live. This video stabilizer feature was first seen about 6 months ago and it's only now functional. I assume some of the dev teams do a round or two of private testing with new features before rolling them out to the public. Bee Wee how can I use the camera app? Google photos offers only watching pics, not taking them. SnackPacks Just take the video with your normal app and Google Photos will do the rest. Just like how they can make a whole movie about a trip you took. It will run in the background. Bee Wee thx alot edgarwong it is done after you take the video so you can use whatever app you want then go to google photos and stabilize the video Bee Wee thx zebinadams The video stabilization is done after the fact, not while recording the video. You can use whatever app you want to take the video. I assume, you could even upload a video taken on an actual camera and then use the tool in Photos to stabilize that as well to remove any shaking that might be in there. I just wish that there was the ability to get this same editing from the web on desktop. Bee Wee thank you all whispy_snippet So as I see it, this will only be useful for people with devices that don't already have some form of video stabilisation. So the Pixel for example, which has EIS, won't benefit from this at all. It's effectively the same thing. demarcmj I imagine the Pixel EIS uses the gyroscope whereas this post-processing does not (and could not). From that standpoint, I would expect the Pixel EIS to be a little better. On the other hand, the Pixel EIS has to work in real time wheras this post-processing option can take as long as it needs. From that standpoint, the post-processing seems to have an advantage. At the end of the day, I'm very curious which one is better... if there is any noticeable difference. If this algorithm is really good, it could be beneficial even for people that already have some form of stabilization, because they could turn it off and use this instead. whispy_snippet Indeed. I understand that the two forms of stabilisation aren't exactly the same. Certainly with respect to one operating in real time while the other is applied after the fact. I guess what I meant is that they're effectively the same thing in that they reach the same end point albeit via different means - one exploiting the gyroscope and the other analysing individual video frames. I too would be interested to see which one is better. However Google Photos' method would have to be pretty impressive to convince me to disable my Pixel's EIS and instead manually stabilise my videos. It almost feels like Photos' stabilisation will be redundant pretty soon. Almost every decent phone has some form of real time stabilisation these days with the technology getting better all the time. Gerardo Sarabia Not the same. What I noticed right away is that GPhotos method warps the image. The Pixel method seems to be better since it has more information on the actual movement. demarcmj I wonder if it does that same jerking effect if you pan slowly, like the pixel EIS bug Jason Overall a nice addition. Still don't know why this is done on device. The YouTube stabilization feature is obviously cloud-based. The best thing to do for future videos is apply this after shooting a video and then have it back up the stabilized version. This eliminates the need to re-download the video on your device to edit. catalysto But then what if you want to stabilize a video while you're without a network connection? Like on travel? pfmiller It's hard to imagine a situation where I'd need a video stabilized so urgently. ilovetesla who is Jolly Swagman. ??? Ibrahim Yusuf A really awesome person whispy_snippet Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong, Under the shade of a coolibah tree, And he sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled, Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me? Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda, Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me? And he sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled, Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me? Along came a jumbuck to drink at the billabong, Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee, And he sang as he stowed that jumbuck in his tucker bag, You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me. Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda, Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me? And he sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled, Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me? Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred, Down came the troopers, one, two, three, Whose is that jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag? You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me. Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda, Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me? And he sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled, Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me? Up jumped the swagman, leapt into the billabong, You'll never catch me alive, said he, And his ghost may be heard as you pass by the billabong, Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me. Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda, Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me? And he sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled, Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me? ilovetesla i seriously don't know what song lyrics are these , but it looks good whispy_snippet Ha, it's actually a really old Australian folk song by a guy called Banjo Patterson. Like, from 1895! Not many people would know it other than us Aussies! Kevin Davis Very nice. Google Photos is great, especially with the constant updates, additions, and improvements it receives. God of chaos It's glorious. bob @Richard Gao There is a mistake in article: You wrote: "We also get a glimpse of how it compares with YouTube's stabilization via this ViewSync link, and the Photos-edited video is far, far better." Should be: (left is photos, right is None) Richard Gao Thanks, fixed. Had a brain fart, adjusted the link to point to the YouTube playlist with the YouTube-stabilized video. Green I tried this... It has trouble for really shaky footage Antics Great - they brought back a feature they killed off from the Google+ Photos days! Looks like it works well too! Stefan Seidel So what? My Sony Z3c does that at least as well if not better. I have a video here where I was filming on a trampoline and you can hardly notice that I was jumping on it, it looks like it's been shot by a drone.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 133 Plus 1 on G+ 291 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares505 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 3 [Deal Alert] Staples has the Lenovo ThinkPad Chromebook 11e for $140 ($210 off) 2017/04/16 1:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] The first episode of Doctor Who season 10, plus the first episode of Class (a spinoff), are free on Google Play 2017/04/16 8:33am PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

To do good for society, you do not necessarily need money. However, it becomes easier to help the unprivileged if you have money. That is where philanthropy helps. Working on the same idea, Google established ‘Google.org’ in October 2005. Google.org is the philanthropic arm of Google which addresses humanitarian issues. It helps not-for-profit organisations by providing them resources and monetary help. It develops and invests in pursuits that can have measurable impact on local, regional and global issues, and rallies Google’s people in support of these efforts with a singular goal of creating a better world, faster. Commitment In order to help the education sector in India, Google has announced grants worth $8.4 million to four not-for-profit organisations of India. These grants, that are part of a global $50 million commitment that Google.org has made, will help the non-profits that are building tech-based learning solutions for rural as well as urban students. “Google has never taken a conventional approach to solving problems, and neither does Google.org. Our approach is to find the most promising non-profits and put the best of Google — our philanthropy, our people, our products — to work and help them close this gap,” said Rajan Anandan, vice-president Southeast Asia and India, Google. Google.org revealed that even though there are more than 1.51 million private and government schools in India and around 260 million students are enrolled in them, the state and quality of education is still atrocious. Around 43% students of Class III cannot read a Class I-level text; approximately 30% of Class III students cannot do a two-digit subtraction and approximately 50% of all Class V students cannot read simple texts or do arithmetic. The condition of the education system in India has deteriorated to a level that around one lakh schools have only one teacher employed for the whole school. Backup To fight this, Google.org has awarded grants to four not-for-profit organisations. Grants from Google.org will be used to scale up existing initiatives to reach more children, and to build more innovative and engaging tech-based learning solutions to close the gap in learning and academic opportunity. “We believe technology can help bridge the gap; it can get more books to students, more lesson plans to teachers, and classrooms to kids who can't get there themselves. At Google.org, we are committed to supporting and working alongside these organisations to bridge the quality education gap,” said Nick Cain, Program Manager, Education, Google.org. The beneficiaries: Learning Equality Learning Equality has received a grant of $5,00,000 and will be working with the help of their local partner — Motivation For Excellence. The organisation has built a free open-source software to bring online material — including books, video tutorials and quizzes — offline for students.

Blog Contact Us   Five great Google Easter eggs Posted on April 13, 2017   In most cases, Google treats its search queries very seriously. It wants to give you the most relevant response to whatever you type in, and does so without comment or judgment. Now and again though, programmers like to have a bit of fun and sneak in little hidden features, jokes and messages that most people will never notice. An ‘Easter egg’ is something inserted into an interactive work that’s somewhat hidden away and can be found either by chance or careful investigation. It’s so called because, like the chocolate eggs you might receive this weekend, you have to hunt for them, and many people enjoy the challenge of doing so. The first known Easter egg in computing was created by Atari programmer Warren Robinett, who hid his name behind a single pixel during a level of the 1979 game ‘Adventure’. One could argue that Easter eggs existed years before the phrase was coined, with musicians like The Beatles inserting what some hear as backwards, subliminal messages in their songs. Microsoft hid an ambitious Easter egg in Excel 97 that allowed the user to play a flight simulator game. I remember somebody discovering this in school one day, resulting in everybody in the class playing this hidden game rather than doing whatever spreadsheet-oriented task they were supposed to be working on. What does this have to do with Google? Well, as the most visited site on the internet, it’s not surprising that the search engine has hidden a fair few Easter eggs of its own. Here are five terms you can Google if you would like a bit of a surprise: 1. Do a barrel roll ‘Do a barrel roll’ is a phrase often used in gaming as a piece of advice that achieves nothing. If you type it into Google, the search engine will take your instruction literally and send its search results for a spin. Incidentally, this achieves nothing either, but is a fun quirk. 2. Anagram Word nerds have always loved the internet, with sites like the Anagram Genius providing a huge archive of phrases you can make by rearranging the letters of another phrase. Google gets in on the fun too with its ‘Did you mean:’ suggestions for ‘anagram’ and ‘define anagram’. 3. Recursion Recursion is defined as ‘the repeated application of a recursive procedure or definition’. If you search for it on Google, you’ll find that the search engine’s ‘Did you mean:’ suggestion applies recursion itself. 4. Askew Search for the word ‘askew’, and you’ll find that your results appear a little bit wonky. This used to also work for a search for ‘tilt’, but doesn’t any more, possibly due to the growth of the crowdfunding website Tilt.com. 5. Zerg rush Perhaps the coolest and most visual Google Easter egg occurs if you search for ‘zerg rush’. A tactic used in strategy game StarCraft, searching for it will cause Google to perform a zerg rush on your results. It should be noted that this only works on a desktop search. Maybe there are other Easter eggs out there in the world of Google that have yet to be discovered? If you would like to discover eggs hidden in software, music, films, TV programmes and more, Eeggs.com offers thousands of them.

Whether or not that’s true is up for debate. Certainly, some aren’t a fan of Microsoft making it difficult to change the search engine in Windows 10 to Google in its Edge browser. That Bing is the default search in Windows 10 gets to the very heart of what Microsoft is trying to do with the operating system. Microsoft gave the upgrade away to anyone who had Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 because it hoped to offer them an expanded array of services, apps and downloads that they otherwise wouldn’t be enticed to try. Computing habits are changing. Microsoft has two rivals in the operating system space: Apple and Google. Both of those companies give updates to their operating systems away for free, banking on users adopting in mass and boosting usage of their other services. Windows 10 does the same thing for Microsoft. That’s why the Bing search engine is so heavily integrated with it. Read: 23 Windows 10 Upgrade Problems & Fixes It’s Bing that processes search in the taskbar. It’s Bing that works behind the scenes, processing commands for Cortana. Cortana is Microsoft’s digital assistant. You can’t change how tightly integrated with Bing is with Windows 10, but you can change the default search engine in Window’s 10’s default web browser. Microsoft Edge is Internet Explorer’s replacement. Here’s how to change the search engine in Windows 10. Changing Your Default Microsoft Edge Search Engine Press the Windows key on your keyboard, the Windows button in the Taskbar or the physical Windows button on your touch-screen device. Now look for the Microsoft Edge app. It has a bright blue tile, with Microsoft Edge written in the bottom left corner. It should be pinned to your Start Menu or Start Screen. If it’s not and you have a mouse, click on the All Apps button. If you’re on touch, tap the Menu button in the top-left corner and tap on All Apps. Tap or click on the three dots in the top-right corner of your screen. Now tap or click on Settings inside the menu. Scroll down to the bottom of the list of Settings. Now tap or click on View Advanced Settings. Welcome to the Advanced Settings menu within Microsoft Edge. From here you can change many of the features of the browser, including the default search engine. Scroll down towards the bottom of the Settings. You’re looking for a field called Search in the Address Bar. Tap or click on the Change Search Engine button. Tap or click on Google in the drop down menu. If it’s not there for you, it’s because Edge has to discover a search engine before the option appears here. As such, you’ll need to go to Google.com using the browser for the option to surface. As you can see in these examples, this discovery feature works for more than just a few sites. You could have tons of options already. Tap or click Set as Default. From this point on, typing anything in the search bar within Microsoft Edge brings you to Google Search results instead of Bing search results. You can switch to other search engines that support Microsoft Edge too. For example, Wikipedia already supports being set as the default search engine in Windows 10. Unfortunately, that’s all the changes that Microsoft allows for search. Using the search box or Cortana in Windows 10 still defaults you back to Bing. There’s no way to change this. To prevent yourself from using this search box you can hide it by right-clicking or tapping and holding on it to hide the box. There’s no way to use Cortana and not be connected to Bing in some way. Read: Best Windows 10 Browser: Edge vs Chrome Good luck with changing the search engine in Windows 10. Gotta Be Mobile has broken down many of Microsoft Edge’s new features and upgrades for users here. It’s a nice web browser that gives users tons of options, even if they can’t change the search engine Cortana uses. 6 Best Windows 10 Laptops in 2017 Lenovo Yoga 710 - $769.99   1 / 6 The Lenovo Yoga 710 is a mid-range Windows 10 laptop that is ready for the way you work now and the way you might work tomorrow. From top to bottom the machine measures 0.58-inches. It weighs 3.52 pounds. As such, heft isn’t one of the things you’ll immediately notice when you pick it up. You will notice the aluminum-clad chassis that’s cold to the touch and can take a beating too. Read: Lenovo Yoga 710 14-inch Review Built into the notebook is a 14-inch high-definition display that supports touch technology. The hinges in the notebook allow the screen to be folded on to the back of the notebook. This turns it into a tablet in situations where touch is beneficial. Because it’s a Lenovo laptop, the Yoga 710 is highly configurable. Every version includes 2 USB 3.0 ports, a Micro HDMI port, a media card reader, DisplayPort, headset jack and Windows 10 Home. It can be configured with up to a 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-7500U processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of solid state storage.

Why would you want to do this??? Because most intelligent people would NOT want to have Bing as a search engine. DUH 01/31/2016 Philip Reply Do you listen? You can absolutely change the default search engine. That is the whole point of the article. You must first go to the desired search provider’s site (google.com), go to settings, advanced settings, search with, and it show show Bing (default) and Google (detected). 08/02/2016 G J T Reply Perfect, thank you. 11/29/2016 rsg Reply Ummm, my drop down does NOT offer Google as a search engine choice. I guess I will have to figure out how to break into the program and override their heavy handed tactics or use another operating system. Shame, because I have liked Win10 so far. 08/23/2015 Helena_Hanbasket Reply GOOGLE IS NOT AN OPTION AND IT PISSES ME OFF. 01/31/2016 Philip Reply You can absolutely change the default search engine. You must first go to the desired search provider’s site (google.com), go to settings, advanced settings, search with, and it should show Bing (default) and Google (detected). 12/10/2015 iiOnebuddyHelps Reply All possible search engines need to be discovered. 1st Step: type google.com in your bing (or other) search 2nd step: enter a new tab and close the previous one 3rd step: follow the previous steps originally posted there 4th step: you should find the google search engine there Hope this helps! 12/21/2015 Cherelyn Reply This worked perfectly when Google wasn’t showing as an option. Thank you :) 01/08/2016 Patsy Reply Thank you so much! Have been struggling with this and cursing….for ages! 12/18/2015 Trish Reply Bing is not as good as Google, it drops out to much when trying to find a site 02/13/2016 Omar O'Hara Reply Bing2Google did the trick for me. It’s available on the Chrome Web Store here: https://goo.gl/JAnBDk The only thing I can’t tell is whether or not it passes the search onto Google after Bing already gets credit for it. I don’t know why Microsoft’s attempt to force Bing search on people bothers me so much, but it does. Especially when it wouldn’t have difficult to simply give users the option. 03/22/2016 Saket Khanna (@senseq) Reply There’s now a chrome extension that can help with this. Once your default browser is set to chrome , you should install chrometana. And presto – Cortana will redirect to Google :-) Link to extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrometana-redirect-bing/kaicbfmipfpfpjmlbpejaoaflfdnabnc/related 04/04/2016 Angelika Reply There is no Google option!!!!! 07/20/2016 xetapexetape Reply i doubt anyone looking to change the default search engine in the windows search feature will be using the default edge browser… 03/23/2017 Lord_Beavis Reply You hit that nail right between the eyes! 07/29/2016 Kman Reply excellent efficient info. Thank you. Now I can use edge and with google rather than bing. 12/09/2016 someguy Reply All of these people complaining about not finding Google in the list of available search engines clearly did not read the article. 03/23/2017 Lord_Beavis Reply Sounds like my users at work when I send out setup instructions for something… 03/23/2017 Lord_Beavis Reply Being unable to change the Windows 10 search from Bing is one of the many reasons I hate Microsoft. If I didn’t need Win 10 at work, I wouldn’t use it anywhere else. All my personal stuff is Linux (which you didn’t mention as a contender, BTW) except for and Xbox 360 and a Win7 gaming rig that I am in the process of replacing with a SteamOS rig. I have a few choice words about Microsoft, but I’m sure the post would be removed so I’ll keep them to myself. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Published on April 16, 2017. 0 There are many mobile browsers nowadays, but you won’t go wrong with choosing Google Chrome. It’s lightweight and won’t bog down your mobile device, and it’s built with excellent security to help maintain your online safety.

There’s no need to fret since installing Google Chrome on your device is easy. We’ve listed the steps you need to take below: For Android devices Go to the Google Play Store. Search for “Google Chrome”. Choose the “Chrome Browser – Google” app from the search results. Tap on the “Install” button. Open the Chrome app to start browsing. For iOS devices Go to iTunes. Search for “Google Chrome”. Choose “Google Chrome – The Fast and Secure Web Browser” from the search results. Tap on the “Get” button. Tap “Install”. Type in your Apple password and tap “OK”. Find the Chrome app on your Home screen and open it to start browsing. You can add Google Chrome to your dock to have easy access to it.

Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical.

They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named.

John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users.

I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers...

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far.........

Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2.

ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling.

Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here. My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor. "Genius" store crooks said I needed a new hard drive and wanted $150. Bought a $20 cable from ebay, watched a few videos and fixed it. Running fine 3 years later. Apple has known about this issue since 2007 but has never acknkowledged it. My Pro cost me more than 1400. I have had sub 500 Windows laptops easily run 5 years.

Google was indeed somewhat a disappointment when it came to the Nexus 6 users upon the release of the most recent Android 7.1.2 Nougat version. Briefly, what bothered many people was the fact that Google brought the update to the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P phones, but left out Nexus 6 and Nexus 9. As bad as it may feel, this is the final proof that the tech giant finished offering support for the two devices. However, they are still on the list of eligible devices for the monthly Android update in 2017. Google Is Selective Even though initially the company declared that this represented just a maintenance update, it turns out that the file included 2 main features: Fingerprint gesture and Google Assistant. Up until now, these features were exclusive for Pixel, and Google brought them to other devices too. Furthermore, Google should have offered Nexus 6 devices the Nougat update, since it is the last software version that the phone can receive. Despite this, the Nexus 6 users are now abandoned, while the company has decided to leave them with the maximum official update at Android 7.1.1. Negative Feedback There are lots of users who took to Reddit to express their dissatisfaction with Google’s decision. Many of them pointed out that this is totally unfair towards their own devices and some even claim that the Nexus 6 is too good a phone to find its end so soon. However, there are a couple of solutions for this. One of the most obvious ones is to upgrade your phone if you want to enjoy the latest OS version. But if you don’t want to do that, you can still wait and root the device yourself, which will allow you to install the Android Nougat final version.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Google Earth has a ‘brand new’ experience on the way Jamie Feltham, Upload VR@UploadVR April 16, 2017 3:34 AM Tags: Google Earth, Google Earth VR, HTC Vive Image Credit: Google Six months ago now, Google launched a VR version of its Google Earth software for the HTC Vive, and it remains one of the best experiences in the industry. There are some updates we’d love to see to the platform, though, and we might get some of them soon. Google is teasing a “brand new” Google Earth experience that it’s set to unveil at 8:30 a.m. Eastern on April 18 at New York’s Whitney Museum of Art. No other details about the experience have been revealed, and it’s very likely that any update would mainly apply to the traditional version of the service that anyone can use rather than the VR version specifically. Still, any such tweaks could feasibly apply to both versions, so we’re still hoping to have at least some VR-relevant news from the event. Earth currently allows you to visit various locations on the planet and view them in 3D. Tokyo springs to life like a model train set that you can explore in great detail, for example, or you could soar over Yosemite National Park like a bird. It’s an amazing piece of software, though it could definitely benefit from a few updates. We’d love to see more locations in 3D for example, as many non-American sites are simply the flat 2D pictures you’re used to seeing on a screen. We also want to see it come to more headsets. Google’s Tilt Brush finally made the jump from Vive to the Oculus Rift earlier this year, and there’s no reason this shouldn’t do the same. It would also be great to get some version of the software on Google’s own mobile VR ecosystem, Daydream, which already has staple apps like StreetView and YouTube on it.

Published on April 16, 2017. 0 You can’t deny that the best thing about working on a PC is the fact that you can open a browser at any time and Google whatever you need. At this point you find out how useful browsers are. Usually the most popular ones are Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, but there are also other useful and interesting ones, such as Vivaldi and UC Browser. Features UC Browser gained its popularity through the fact that it has a well-thought Download Manager. They have the fastest such tool you can find, and you can download files in mere seconds with it. Moreover, the fact that you are downloading something is not going to affect that loading times for the pages you’re looking at. On the other hand, Vivaldi is appreciated because it has a very nice user interface. It has a minimalistic UI, relying on basic icons, color schemes and fonts. However, the main advantage is that you can customize it and make it more personal. Operating System The good news is that the UC Browser works with almost all platforms available out there. You might want to know that a special Windows 10 edition has been recently launched, and besides this one, UC is compatible with Android, iOs and Symbian. Meanwhile, Vivaldi can only be used on Windows, Linux and Mac. All in all, both of these browsers are excellent choices. But besides offering us great options for browsing, there is something more we can learn from here: that we should never limit our choices just to one popular option. Sometimes the smallest products can surprise you, offering great features. And this happens because there are developers out there who do a great job, but don’t have the same money as the tech giants do to invest in marketing.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Software Google kills GTalk – What’s Going to Happen Next? By Elena Anderson. Published on April 16, 2017. 0 Soon, Google will be shutting down the chat service Google Talk, this being replaced with the more recent Google Hangouts. The change will come into effect starting with June 26. After this date, you will be switched to Hangouts for good. Gtalk has been initially launched back in 2005, and it started declining in 2013. Upon its release, Google presented it as a basic chat experience for the Gmail users. Meanwhile, Hangouts is now being used as a business app, given the fact that Google also offers Duo and Android Messages. Before, whoever used Gmail had to switch between Gtalk or Hangouts. The company representatives declared in a blog post that if you are using Gtalk, you will receive a prompt in the following weeks with an invitation to start using Hangouts instead. Hangouts – A Compulsory Choice You have until June 26 to switch to Hangouts, that is, if you wish to do so. However, if you want to stick to the same type of app, this one is the most recommended one. On the official Google support page you can find a series of topics showing how the Gtalk stands against the newer Hangouts, if you’re still not decided on which path to follow. At the same time, Google plans to turn the Hangouts app into a more business-oriented app. They will quit the SMS service included in Hangouts in order to take on Slack, as we found out earlier in an announcement about rebranding. According to their official declarations, the move is aimed to improving some of the most popular features of the app, such as group chat and video conferences. For alternatives that target individual users more, Google will also be heading towards the Android Messages app. All in all, it seems that this is going to be all for the good of the user.

Users of the app - which has been getting us from A to B for more than a decade - will no longer be able to suggests edits or make revisions to the map database. Since 2008 this function had allowed maps to be updated with local knowledge as building or construction changes were made.

"To make it easier for all Google Maps users to contribute changes to the map, we've started to graduate functionality from Map Maker to Google Maps on both desktop and mobile.

Freedman | April 14, 2017 12:04 pm MORE After seven months of silence, Microsoft has stepped up again in its one-sided browser cold war against Google. Last June, Microsoft released a video claiming that Microsoft Edge gets you 70-percent more battery life than Google Chrome on Windows 10. When Google made some enhancements to its Chrome browser, Microsoft clapped back with another video in September. Somehow, this nerdy beef has found its way into 2017. Which is to say, yes, there's another video. This one's running the latest version of Edge in the Windows 10 Creators Update, and pits it against Firefox and Chrome. The video has three Surface Books taking the test, streaming videos form Vimeo in fullscreen over Wi-Fi.  You can see more about the methodology here. MORE: How to Use Windows 10 The video has the machine running Firefox lasting 7 hours and 4 minutes, Chrome enduring for 9:17 and Edge topping out at 12:31. Edge lasted 77 percent longer than Firefox and 35 percent longer than Chrome. Of course, Microsoft ran the tests on their machines and in their labs, so Edge did have an, well, edge. Will Google respond again? Probably not. But hey, we'll take what we can get to squeeze more battery life out of our machines. ✖ Edge Browser Tips Share a Web Page Disable Flash Change Download Folder Send a Web Note Disable or Enable Cookies Stop Restoring Tabs After a Crash Change Search Engine to Google Pin a Website to Windows 10’s Start Menu Enable Do Not Track Set Homepage (or Homepages) Enable Dark Theme How to Enable Do Not Track in Microsoft Edge Browser How to Import Favorites into Edge From Another Browser Clear Your History and Cookies in Microsoft Edge Print in Microsoft Edge Add a Page to the Reading List in Microsoft Edge Browser Rename a Favorite in Microsoft Edge Browser How to Add a Favorite Site/Bookmark in Microsoft Edge How to Open an InPrivate Window in Microsoft Edge Turn On Reading Mode in Microsoft Edge Enable and Use Cortana in Microsoft Edge Block Pop-ups in Microsoft Edge Browser Manage or View Saved Passwords Set Aside Tabs All Windows 10 Tips Share a Web Page Disable Flash Change Download Folder Send a Web Note Disable or Enable Cookies Stop Restoring Tabs After a Crash Change Search Engine to Google Pin a Website to Windows 10’s Start Menu Enable Do Not Track Set Homepage (or Homepages) Enable Dark Theme How to Enable Do Not Track in Microsoft Edge Browser How to Import Favorites into Edge From Another Browser Clear Your History and Cookies in Microsoft Edge Print in Microsoft Edge Add a Page to the Reading List in Microsoft Edge Browser Rename a Favorite in Microsoft Edge Browser How to Add a Favorite Site/Bookmark in Microsoft Edge How to Open an InPrivate Window in Microsoft Edge Turn On Reading Mode in Microsoft Edge Enable and Use Cortana in Microsoft Edge Block Pop-ups in Microsoft Edge Browser Manage or View Saved Passwords Set Aside Tabs All Windows 10 Tips Next Edge Tips »» «« Previous Tip Next Tip »» Edge Browser Tips Share a Web Page Disable Flash Change Download Folder More Tips Share a Web Page Disable Flash Change Download Folder Send a Web Note Disable or Enable Cookies Stop Restoring Tabs After a Crash Change Search Engine to Google Pin a Website to Windows 10’s Start Menu Enable Do Not Track Set Homepage (or Homepages) Enable Dark Theme How to Enable Do Not Track in Microsoft Edge Browser How to Import Favorites into Edge From Another Browser Clear Your History and Cookies in Microsoft Edge Print in Microsoft Edge Add a Page to the Reading List in Microsoft Edge Browser Rename a Favorite in Microsoft Edge Browser How to Add a Favorite Site/Bookmark in Microsoft Edge How to Open an InPrivate Window in Microsoft Edge Turn On Reading Mode in Microsoft Edge Enable and Use Cortana in Microsoft Edge Block Pop-ups in Microsoft Edge Browser Manage or View Saved Passwords Set Aside Tabs All Windows 10 Tips   Author Bio Andrew E.

JuanSoto Says: April 14th, 2017 at 12:39 pm Not a fan of Chrome but Microsoft is the kind of company that would put specialized code in their OS to drain the battery faster when a competing browser (or other competing app) is running. They are the kind of company that pays 3rd-party research teams to tell us how secure and privacy-respecting their OS is. I think Microsoft and the first word association is sleaze. They haven't changed their stripes in decades.

As is the case with all experiments that Google runs, anyone may join it provided that they are either invited, or add the cookie that distinguishes participants from non-participants to their devices. While the majority of Internet sites use white themes, a growing number has added support for darker themes to their sites as well. Additionally, users may style websites individually using userstyles, or directly depending on the browser's capabilities. You may download dozens of styles for YouTube that turn the site's color scheme into a darker one. Note: YouTube's Dark Mode is an experiment right now. This means that there is a possibility that Google will pull the feature before release. YouTube Dark Mode   The main benefit of using the built-in Dark Mode of YouTube is that it works on the whole site, and that it will continue to work even if Google changes part of the site's layout. To enable dark mode on YouTube right now, do the following: Open your web browser of choice. I will explain to you how you can set Dark Mode using Firefox and Chrome. YouTube Dark Mode in Chrome Open the YouTube website in Google Chrome. Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Shift-I to open the Console of the Developer Tools. Paste the following code document.cookie="VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=fPQ4jCL6EiE" and run it with a tap on the Enter-key. Reload the page you are on, for instance with a tap on Ctrl-F5. YouTube Dark Mode in Firefox Open the YouTube website in the Firefox web browser. Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Shift-I to open the Console of the Firefox Developer Tools. Paste the following code document.cookie="VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=fPQ4jCL6EiE" and run it with a tap on the Enter-key. Reload the page you are on, for instance with a tap on Ctrl-F5. Once done, click on the profile icon in the upper right corner on YouTube. You find the new Dark Mode option listed there. Click on the Dark Mode:off option of the context menu. This opens an overlay that explains what Dark Mode is on YouTube. You do get an option to turn it on there, or turn it off again as well. Once enabled, Dark Mode is active on all pages on YouTube that you open. Google notes that Dark Mode has been designed for an ideal experience for night, but no one is keeping you from running Dark Mode 24/7 if you prefer it that way. Dark Mode may go better with darker operating system or browser themes. Now You: What do you prefer, light or dark themes? Summary Article Name Google working on dark mode for YouTube Description Google runs a dark mode experiment right now on the YouTube video streaming platform that allows users to switch the light theme to a dark theme called dark mode.

I was about to say that it's only for the new interface, which I'm not a big fan of (things looked too large, I always felt the need to zoom out), but with dark mode enabled it looks great. Dark UI's FTW ^^ Reply MdN April 16, 2017 at 3:48 pm # Tried it, looks great. YouTube should have have this option by default ages ago as it's annoying to watch a (sometimes) dark video and to have all white around it, this makes more sense. However, just opening the front page and looking at it made my PC jump to using 20% of processor (both on FF and Opera) so I had to delete YouTube cookies and log in again to go back to the old. Too bad. I hope it becomes official soon. Reply kubrick April 16, 2017 at 4:18 pm # Not needed on palemoon.it has a simple extension which makes all pages dark.can be toggled per site.

Reply Anorknee Merce April 17, 2017 at 7:47 am # Seems, the Internet world is going to the Dark Side, eg M$-Win 10 in dark blue theme and available Dark mode. Imagine, the interior of a house all painted in black or dark mode and A4 photostat paper coming out in dark mode or black color. Fyi, many evil crimes occur in the dark of night, and not in bright and white sunshine. Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

A touch of a finger unlocks the phone — no password required. With services like Apple Pay or Android Pay, a fingerprint can buy a bag of groceries, a new laptop or even a $1 million vintage Aston Martin. And pressing a finger inside a banking app allows the user to pay bills or transfer thousands of dollars. While such wizardry is convenient, it has also left a gaping security hole. New findings published last week by researchers at New York University and Michigan State University suggest that smartphones can easily be fooled by fake fingerprints digitally composed of many common features found in human prints. In computer simulations, the researchers from the universities were able to develop a set of artificial “MasterPrints” that could match real prints similar to those used by phones as much as 65 percent of the time. The researchers did not test their approach with real phones, and other security experts said the match rate would be significantly lower in real-life conditions. Still, the findings raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of fingerprint security on smartphones. “It’s almost certainly not as worrisome as presented, but it’s almost certainly pretty darn bad,” said Andy Adler, a professor of systems and computer engineering at Carleton University in Canada, who studies biometric security systems. “If all I want to do is take your phone and use your Apple Pay to buy stuff, if I can get into 1 in 10 phones, that’s not bad odds.” Full human fingerprints are difficult to falsify, but the finger scanners on phones are so small that they read only partial fingerprints. When a user sets up fingerprint security on an Apple iPhone or a phone that runs Google’s Android software, the phone typically takes eight to 10 images of a finger to make it easier to make a match. And many users record more than one finger — say, the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Since a finger swipe has to match only one stored image to unlock the phone, the system is vulnerable to false matches. “It’s as if you have 30 passwords and the attacker only has to match one,” said Nasir Memon, a professor of computer science and engineering at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, who is one of three authors of the study, which was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. The other authors are Aditi Roy, a postdoctoral fellow at NYU’s Tandon School, and Arun Ross, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State. Memon said their findings indicated that if you could somehow create a magic glove with a MasterPrint on each finger, you could get into 40 to 50 percent of iPhones within the five tries allowed before the phone demands the numeric password, known as a personal identification number. Apple said the chance of a false match in the iPhone’s fingerprint system was 1 in 50,000 with one fingerprint enrolled. Ryan James, a company spokesman, said Apple had tested various attacks when developing its Touch ID system, and also incorporated other security features to prevent false matches. Google declined to comment. The actual risk is difficult to quantify. Apple and Google keep many details of their fingerprint technology secret, and the dozens of companies that make Android phones can adapt Google’s standard design in ways that reduce the level of security. Stephanie Schuckers, a professor at Clarkson University and director of the Center for Identification Technology Research, was cautious about the implications of the MasterPrint findings. She said the researchers used a midrange, commercially available software program that was designed to match full fingerprints, limiting the broader applicability of their findings. “To really know what the impact would be on a cellphone, you’d have to try it on the cellphone,” she said. She noted that cellphone-makers and others who use fingerprint security systems are studying anti-­spoofing techniques to detect the presence of a real finger, such as looking for perspiration or examining patterns in deeper layers of skin. Phone-makers also said that the ease of touching a finger to unlock a phone meant more users actually turned on security features instead of leaving their phones unlocked — a common habit in the early days of smartphones. Still, the team’s fundamental finding that partial fingerprints are vulnerable to spoofing is significant, said Chris Boehnen, the manager of the federal government’s Odin program, which studies how to defeat biometric security attacks as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. “What’s concerning here is that you could find a random phone, and your barrier to attack is pretty low,” Boehnen said. Phone-makers could easily increase security by making it harder to match the partial fingerprint, he said, “but the average phone company is more worried about you being annoyed that you have to put your finger against the phone two or three times than they are with someone breaking into it.” Memon said that despite his research he was still using fingerprint security on his iPhone. “I’m not worried,” he said. “I think it’s still a very convenient way of unlocking a phone. But I’d rather see Apple make me enter the PIN if it’s idle for one hour.” More Business articles »     RG Business Local business news sent to your inbox every Thursday.         Today’s Business stories Business Tasting the market: A growing local business provides food samples in stores Business When to pay for ‘free’ shipping Business Phone fingerprint sensors may not be so safe after all National Teachers cash in by putting lessons up for sale Business As prices of new vehicles keep going up, used cars looking shinier to some buyers Business Business Datebook Business Business Beat     Business Business Tasting the market: A growing local business provides food samples in stores Erica Jones has an unusual job — she gives away small amounts of food and drink.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. Crushes Q1 Earnings. Buy JPM Stock at Will. Buy This Dip in Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock View All Posts Over the past few years, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has made a concerted effort to diversify from its legacy Google Search business. Like rival Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet took to the cloud and other initiatives it hopes will pay off for GOOGL stock. Source: Shutterstock The company’s Waymo unit is developing self-driving cars. “Learning thermostat” Google Nest and Google Home provide an entry into the Internet of Things realm; Google Fiber provides high-speed internet access; and the Verily unit provides research in life sciences. As GOOGL stock tries to return to an all-time high reached in mid-March, the potential growth opportunities beyond Google Search are a big part of the bull case. So far, those investments aren’t really moving the needle: 88% of Alphabet’s 2016 revenue still came from advertising, per the company’s 10-K. That is a potential problem for GOOGL stock holders. The online advertising business doesn’t seem particularly healthy at the moment. Google’s YouTube lost a number of clients in Europe amid concerns about the type of content being run next to advertisements. The shift to mobile creates a continuing headwind in terms of pricing. 2016 growth numbers were impressive, but competition from social media providers may limit that growth going forward. That leaves GOOGL stock somewhat reliant on non-Search initiatives, and in particular what the company calls its “Other Bets.” And in many of those efforts, Alphabet appears to be falling behind. GOOGL Stock Is at Risk It might seem premature, if not downright silly, to express concern about Alphabet’s core advertising business. Concerns about cost-per-click (CPC) rates did pressure GOOGL stock a few years back, but growth was impressive in 2016. Overall revenue increased 20%, despite 4 points of currency headwinds. Google-owned properties saw growth accelerate to 22% from 16% the year before. The AdSense business (which Google refers to as Google Network Members) is seeing smaller sales increases, but still grew more than 3% in each of the past two years. Meanwhile, “other” Google revenue jumped up 41%, which the 10-K attributed to app sales through Google Play. Looking forward, however, there are legitimate concerns. Competition is only going to increase, in particular from social media giants Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP). Both companies — along with Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR), although I’m highly skeptical of TWTR’s chances — can offer more direct, more personally tailored advertising options. And, of course, Amazon represents a real threat to Alphabet. That company has a strong ad opportunity of its own, and at least one analyst believes the Amazon Echo could pressure the entire search model longer-term. Even in recent numbers, there are concerns. The most notable is that cost-per-click continues to decline, largely a result of the continuing shift to mobile. The AdSense business is rather stagnant at this point. Growth in Android usage and increasing share for the Chrome browser and Google Docs have helped, but those tailwinds will fade, if only due to the already-large proportion Google owns in both markets. There’s a real, “okay, then what?” concern about what happens to GOOGL stock once “click growth” slows.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

Google app v7.0 beta includes new Assistant Notification settings, plans redesign of Assistant Services directory, and hints at new device called "Bisto" [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/13 4:29am PDTApr 13, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 146 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares249 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Update 1: 2017/04/14 4:55am PDT Notification toggle was removed in a subsequent update Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Toggle Google Assistant Notifications 1.2 Prevent icons from being added with new app installs 1.3 Bug fix: No more crashing from swiping away cards 2 Teardown 2.1 Services are going to be easier to manage 2.2 code 2.3 A new device type called "Bisto" 2.4 code 2.5 code 3 Download The Google app went through a major version bump to 7.0 and began rolling out to the beta channel a couple of days ago. A bit of digging around turned up a few new settings, but nothing that explains why the version number went up on this release. Along with the new features, a teardown also raises some light on a few things we can look forward to in the future, including some vital improvements for Services accessed through Google Assistant and what may be a new type of device. If you're not part of the beta channel, you can grab the latest version of the Google app – now with fewer crashes – from APK Mirror. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Toggle Notifications for Google Assistant Toggle Auto-add app icons for new installs (Android O) Bug fix: No more crashing on card dismissals Toggle Google Assistant Notifications Update 1: 2017/04/14 4:55am PDT Notification toggle was removed in a subsequent update It looks like this toggle was revealed a bit prematurely. With the release of a minor update to v7.0.08, the Notification toggles have been removed. That probably explains why they didn't seem to do anything. At this point, this section might belong in the teardown because the setting will probably return in the future. – Thanks, Kfir Sadeh. End of Update Google is working hard to make Assistant more useful and appealing to users, and that often means it will have to behave a little differently from one user to the next. Not only that, but it probably has to behave a little differently from one device to another, especially when they come in different form factors. The latest Google app update brings a little more configurability with a new setting for Assistant that allows users to toggle notifications on or off for their phones and Google Home devices. Here's the description: Receive notifications like weather updates on this device. Even if notifications are off, you'll still hear alarms and important updates. By default, the setting will be enabled on phones and disabled on Google Home. If you would like to change the setting, just go into the Google app Settings screen and then tap into the Assistant settings. You can switch between the Phone settings and Google Home with the dropdown at the top of the page, and then switch between Home units with another selector further down the page. Notifications toggles for Google Home (left) and phones (right) It's safe to assume that this refers to those low-priority items that silently slip into the notification list with current weather conditions, due dates for bills, and occasionally some important local news. At least that's how they usually present themselves on a phone. Google Home might be a different story, and that might make this a little more interesting. So far, Assistant on Google Home has only been known to become active when an alarm goes off or somebody interacts with it directly through voice commands or casting. The rest of the time, it stays quiet. Enabling this setting would seem to suggest that it could now (or soon) wake up from time to time to let you know it started raining outside or that the mayor of a nearby town was arrested for some pretty nasty things. (True story.) I've had the setting enabled for several hours on my Google Home, but there haven't been any notifications read aloud to me yet. I don't know if there just haven't been any events or if this isn't really supposed to be doing anything (yet). Prevent icons from being added with new app installs A couple of weeks ago, a teardown turned up a new setting destined for Google's launcher. Its purpose was to simply turn off the behavior that created icons on the home screen for freshly installed apps. That toggle is now live in the v7.0 update, but with a weird catch: It only works on Android O, or API 26, to be specific. Only users running a developer preview will be able to see the toggle for now. Readers of the teardown rightly brought up the point that the Play Store offers a similar setting. However, that toggle only applies to apps installed through the Play Store, not to those from other sources like the Amazon Appstore. Perhaps this is related to–or inspired by–the change in the way unfamiliar app installers are handled in Android O. Bug fix: No more crashing from swiping away cards If you installed v7.0.4 of the Google app and ventured into your Now stream, there's a pretty good chance you also tried to swipe away a card and witnessed the scene above. Yes, there was a bug in that release and it had the undesirable effect of crashing the home screen. Version 7.0.6, which is linked below, fixes the issue. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Services are going to be easier to manage After Google opened the gates for developers to build services for Assistant, there was a predictable flood of submissions attempting to get the attention of users. We're now staring at an unwieldy, disorganized list that's pretty hard to keep up to date with. Naturally, Google is moving to solve this by adding a few tools to make all of these services a little easier to sift through and use. First, services (referred to as "agents" by Google's developers) will be sorted into categories so you won't have to stumble through a list containing everything from food delivery services to games. <string name="agent_directory_category">Category</string> <string name="agent_directory_category_list_header">Categories</string> If you're still having trouble finding the service you want, you'll also be able to ask Assistant to help out. <string name="agent_directory_ask_prompt">Ask your Assistant</string> Once you're using a service and find that it's really good (or bad), you'll be able to give your feelings about it with a rating, feedback, or even report it if something is really not right about it. Ratings will obviously also be reflected in the directory of services so everybody will be able to ignore the ones that didn't live up to other peoples' standards. code <string name="agent_directory_rate_service_prompt">Rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_subtitle">Rate your experience with %1$s on Google Assistant</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_title_after_rating">Your rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_title_before_rating">Rate %1$s</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_five_stars_button">Five stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_four_stars_button">Four stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_three_stars_button">Three stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_two_stars_button">Two stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_one_star_button">One star</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_agent_avg_rating">%1$s star rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_agent_rating_menu_delete">Delete</string> <string name="agent_directory_agent_rating_menu_edit">Edit</string> <plurals name="agent_directory_a11y_user_rating"> <item quantity="other">Your rating %d stars.</item> <item quantity="one">Your rating %d star.</item> </plurals> <string name="agent_feedback_from_header_text">From</string> <string name="agent_directory_feedback_send">Send</string> <string name="agent_directory_report">Report service</string> <string name="agent_directory_report_agent_text"><u>Report service</u></string> Once you've chosen a few services that you like, you'll be able to add them to a personalized list. The term 'shortcut' is also used a few times and might be a way for users to attach their own custom names to services, and maybe even fill in some of the information for regular requests. <string name="agent_directory_my_services_header">My Services</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_title">Your %1$s shortcuts</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_subtitle">Customize your shortcuts for %1$s</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_create">CREATE</string> Most of this is pretty predictable stuff and was bound to happen eventually, and perhaps it should have been done a bit earlier. Nevertheless, as the infrastructure improves, so does the ecosystem. A new device type called "Bisto" Every once in a while, something really unusual comes up in a teardown... This is one of those times. There's a new device type listed among the strings in this update, and they refer to something known internally as "Bisto." This obviously has nothing to do with the British brand of foods, but instead refers to a device that is somehow distinct from other current products. code <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_android_tv">Android TV</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_bisto">Bisto</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_google_home">Google Home</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_nexus">Pixel</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_phone">Phone</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_wear">Android Wear</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_android_tv_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdAndroidTvCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_bisto_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdBistoCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_google_home_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdGoogleHomeCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_nexus_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdNexusCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_wear_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdWearCategory</string> The list of device types above shows that Bisto is going to be treated differently from Android TV, Google Home, Android Wear, a Google Pixel, and the general category of "phone." Of course, since this list already makes a distinction between the Pixel and a regular phone, we can't eliminate the possibility Bisto is another phone or a special release matching one of the other products. code <string name="bisto_device_notifications_pref_title">Spoken notifications</string> <string name="bisto_device_notifications_pref_summary">Notifications will be read aloud inside your headphones</string> from /res/xml/assistant_device_id_bisto_settings.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.PreferenceHolder android:key="@string/assistant_device_id_group_holder"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenPreferenceCategory android:title="@string/assistant_settings_device_id_category" android:key="@string/assistant_device_id_bisto_preference_category"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenDropDownPreference android:persistent="false" android:key="bistoDeviceId" /> <SwitchPreferenceCompat android:persistent="false" android:title="@string/bisto_device_notifications_pref_title" android:key="bistoNotifications" android:summary="@string/bisto_device_notifications_pref_summary" /> </com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenPreferenceCategory> </com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.PreferenceHolder> </PreferenceScreen> The current manifestation involving Bisto is a single toggle that offers to read notifications aloud to the user through headphones. This means the product can at least support headphones, which only really eliminates Android Auto and other in-car products – many states and countries don't allow drivers to wear headphones. We can also surmise that Bisto includes a screen since this setting gives the option to read notifications through headphones, but likely shows them in some other way if the setting is disabled. In other words, it's probably not an audio-only device like Google Home. Since these are settings for Assistant, the final assertion we can make is that the device will obviously include Google Assistant. From that, we can also assume it will have a microphone and probably a speaker. Okay, those aren't strictly sure things, but the odds are in our favor. Unfortunately, that's about as far as the clues take us. It probably has more in common with a phone than it does with Google Home, and it's not going to be exclusive to a car... Bisto might be an entirely new category of hardware, a specially branded device from an existing category, or even just the name used internally for Android One devices with Google Assistant. It's too early to speculate much beyond that, but we'll definitely be on the lookout for more hints.

Cody Toombs It's certainly possible. There are a few variants of Glass roaming around, including a couple of models that are only available to partners and supposedly one that has no screen and operates a lot like Google Home. That last one can probably be ruled out because it lacks a screen, but I could see how some of the partners might want Google Assistant on their Glass units. I hope this isn't the case since it means we probably wouldn't get to confirm it for a long time. On the other hand, it's always possible (but unlikely, I think) that Google is thinking about taking another run at launching Glass. marcusmarcus2 Maybe it is for "Android Things" Isaac Fischer Guesses for Bisto: a Glass redux or a wall panel / standalone home control device. whispy_snippet Bisto = Bison? Guest You can change the notification setting for Google Home through the Google app the same way you can for the phone. When I go to settings through the Google app there's a toggle to select either my Pixel XL Assistant settings or Google Home Assistant https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cdb9430794930787147ba2eb5fe2032e0a4528b2dc567b1c549a034f441c1ef1.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9cec9c79b31aca40a0b7f0025450a895c74544e859fb60bae9c7d280e6ff1cce.png settings Cody Toombs Ahh, you're right. I don't know why I keep forgetting that, I even explained the layout in a teardown many months ago. Every time I see the dropdown indicator, I think it's used for collapsing the section below it, which makes no sense. DJ SPY We've been able to turn off and on the thing about a new app icon being added to the home screen, directly from the play store for ever. What's the point of that option being in the Google app now? F4LL0U7 Second paragraph of that section: "Readers of the teardown rightly brought up the point that the Play Store offers a similar setting. However, that toggle only applies to apps installed through the Play Store, not to those from other sources like the Amazon Appstore." mike shwilly How about song recognition? Or it will be classic Google waiting a whole year to present this "feature" with a new OS? Josh Flowers Seriously! I heard a song yesterday, pulled out the phone, "ok google -- what's this song?" --"I'm sorry, I can't do that yet." Instant thought: I've replaced a superior product with an inferior product. F4LL0U7 Why not just use the widget icon that you can add to your home screen? That still works. Josh Flowers Don't have a widget. I think I deleted 'Sound Search' when I had Google Now. Just re-installed, thanks...but bummed I have to do so. F4LL0U7 It's not the standalone Sound Search app that hasn't been updated in years. It's a widget that's part of the Google app itself. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b12d0cd106c2504e21827d19c9164f96401e390950988d2fa533f424eb61fa80.png nxtiak Don't need widget.

Scott Still no f@#$ing search tools... Nick V I hope Bisto is a new tablet device. My 2013 Nexus 7 is not going to make it much longer... Fresh360 It may be all in my head but it seems that Assistant gives me more "bad" results and doesn't understand my voice inputs way more than plain ol Google Now...Especially with playing music thru GPM : ( Zach Mauch Bisto = Andromeda Confirmed!!!!! ;-) Kaden Gordon Says who? I mean, it makes some sense, but who said that? Zach Mauch See the ";-)". That means I am winking after my comment. So if I said that in real life and then winked, I would expect one to think that I am not being serious or making a joke. Callum Saunders I'm thinking that bisto is this reiteration of google glass that is audio only. I'd say maybe a take on apple's airpods but that include google assistant? This would tie into the partnership with sony to bring the high quality bluetooth audio to Android O. I imagine these will be bundled with the pixels to compensate for removing the headphone jack and this would be a way for them to market it as BETTER than the headphone jack. LondonLeedsFan I'm on beta for the Google app and other than getting Assistant, nothing in regards to layout or appearance has changed on any update on about 6 months? Czifra János And one new think on a video: https://youtu.be/bdw6oGYm6tI Willie Chalmers III Looks like you just got the server side switch for a feature that's been around for a month.

Filipe Santos Come on Google release the damn Assistant to other countries, like Portugal but Please!!! Don't release in pt-br.... Suck so hard Andy J .... I wonder if this services menu will be available in the UK.... the way things are going - probably not. Frank Schumacher The notification setting just vanished in new beta 7.0.8! Alan Cramer Still no Google Assistant for GSuite users it appears. Kaden Gordon Bisto could be an app for all devices, and acts as an all-in-one notification manager Iamsecond Could Bisto refer to a new assistant based on Linda Bellingham? Let's hope so! Camerooni I'd like them to add an option to automatically 'ding' on the hour and say 'It's 2 o'clock pm' etc. My grandparents used to have a little clock like this when I was a kid and I thought it was amazing.. haven't found anything that did it since :/ Prasad Bhusari Sir i am using one plus x and i am unable to use Google assistance also root my phone still its happening i use all tricks plz help me JG With the "it probably won't be audio only" bit, I'm assuming my idea for Bisto is pretty much out... Not even sure if it'd be product worthy or not, but... Last year, Sony released the Xperia Ear. Basically a Bluetooth headset that could read notifications etc to you. The goal was to keep your head up and engaged with your surroundings, rather than always looking down at a phone screen. I'm kind of picturing the Assistant embedded into a headset, sort of a portable, personal Google Home. It could potentially work as an Android Wear alternative. Rather than having to pull your phone out of your pocket, or even glance at your wrist, it could just read your new Hangout message right in your ear. Might come in handy during the next -40 Snowpocolypse when you don't want to unbundle your layers to get either your watch or phone out. I'd imagine most headsets would probably already let you control the phone's Assistant. Google did buy a company to get tech to improve audio quality, maybe they could leverage that into this... I also wouldn't mind seeing Google produce a case that would both protect my new Pixel 2 and house the earpiece. I never use them because I don't want them in my ear all day and because they're smaller, I'm afraid I'll lose them if I shove them in a pocket or whatever so they just sit at home when I need them the most. If they lived in/on my phone case I'd have them 24/7 (the case could also allow both the headset and phone to be charged at the same time). Like Wear, it could use WiFi to extend it's useful range. WiFi Assistant could automatically log it into open networks and it could harvest passwords for protected networks when you pair it to your phone. Too bad it wouldn't have the battery life to support its own cellular connection.

Some owners are experiencing bad Nexus Android Nougat battery life. Or at least a drop when many expected improvements. With that in mind here we’ll be explaining what could be causing it, and how to improve Android 7.0 Nougat battery life for the Nexus 5x, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Pixel C and more. Including Android 7.1.1 Nougat and the Google Pixel. There are a lot of things that could cause battery drain, so we’ll go through a few different potential fixes. Read: Nexus Android 7.1.1 Release: What to Know On August 22nd Android Nougat was officially released. During the holiday months of December 2016 they rolled out maintenance updates to Android 7.1.1 too. Sadly, the update isn’t perfect and we’re hearing some are experiencing minor problems, bugs or suffering from poor battery life. Here is some helpful advice. Abnormal battery drain is a common problem, especially after big software updates of this size. Often the first few days or week of an update users report problems. That’s typical because the update and changes are settling in, or you’re using the device more than before. Meaning, give it a few days before decided if battery life is “bad” or not. This is more present now that we have monthly security updates. Android Nougat has a new “Doze” feature which should make battery life better, but some reports claim the opposite. In fact, heading over to Reddit or even the official Google forum bug tracker, you’ll see lots of complaints about a wide array of problems. Most notably Nexus Android 7.0 battery life issues. For now Android 7.0 battery life problems are somewhat isolated, and I’m not experiencing any, but as the update hits more and more devices like the Nexus 5X or Nexus 6P, we expect the list of problems to grow. Here’s our initial Android 7.0 problems & fixes, and we’ll add more once they appear. How to Fix Nexus Android Nougat Battery Life Problems We’re here to try and help solve some of the bad Nexus Android 7.0 battery life problems users are experiencing, but may need to wait on Google to release a quick 7.0.1 bug fix. The developer previews ran pretty great, but had battery problems too, so Google should be well aware of this and working on a solution. Find Battery Draining Apps The first thing users should do if they notice extreme battery drops is check for rogue apps using more battery life than they should. This could be a malfunctioning app that may not be ready to run right with Nougat, an app keeping the system awake, or other things. Typically heading to settings > battery > and looking at the list of apps draining battery you’ll get a good idea of what’s going on. Android System or the Screen (Display) are usually at the top of the list, but we’ve been seeing a problem where “Android OS” is taking the most, followed by Android System. One should be there, the other should not. Android System is typically one of the higher drains, but not the OS aspect. The Google issue tracker has several reports of this problem dating back to the 3rd developer preview of Android N. While Google services or Android System often take up battery to perform important tasks in the operating system, “Android OS” shouldn’t be at the top of the list. Some users reported the OS taking more battery while the phone was off, than the screen does while the device is turned on. The screen should be the biggest drain, not the operating system. Google’s working hard on a fix, but we have some potential solutions as well. Oddly enough, one is to turn off Bluetooth if you don’t need it. Android Wear, Android Auto and other devices require Bluetooth, but many users have noticed substantially better battery life with Bluetooth turned off. Check the list of apps in the battery settings to see if anything else is causing drain. Apps like Facebook and Snapchat can often be the problem as well, so keep that in mind. Selecting an app and hitting “Force Stop” can kill the process and improve battery, but don’t kill anything unless you know what it does. Reinstalling an app is also another good idea. Widgets can be a big battery drain also, so consider checking on those apps. Lastly, try booting into Safe Mode. Safe Mode will disable third-party applications and that will allow you to narrow your search to find any potential problems. Those with the battery running out around 30% have another issue completely that we’re hearing Google is investigating. So hold tight. Check Account Sync Similar to apps draining your battery as mentioned above, apps being synced and backed up could be the culprit too. Multiple users on Reddit noticed that on the Nexus 6P the device wasn’t syncing right, causing huge drains in battery life. Imagine your phone trying to sync to the cloud and save all of your contacts, photos, Google drive documents or Google music over and over again. That will surely effect battery life. The user recommends heading into Settings > Accounts > and looking for any that have the sync icon or a (!) next to them, suggesting sync had failed. To make matters worse, manually refreshing accounts to sync didn’t fix the problem. One owner went into each Google account sync option and did it manually. For Google Drive, fit, photos, music, keep, and even 3rd party apps like Skype, and re-synced each one. Multiple users have noticed substantially improved Nexus battery life after doing this. To take this further, Skype sync was causing the problem for a few users, so be sure to check any and all apps and accounts to make sure sync is working. Then, continue on for the rest of our tips. Disable Unused Services If your apps are functioning properly try disabling unnecessary services on your Nexus phone or tablet. Disabling connections and other services when you aren’t using them could save you some battery life. We mentioned bluetooth above, and will say it again. Actually, we’re seeing a lot of complaints about Bluetooth problems, and some of those could be causing battery drain. Turn if off if you don’t need it. We highly recommend shutting off Wi-Fi connectivity, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS, and cellular data when you don’t need them turned on. You can turn those off from the Nexus’ quick settings menu or you can turn them off from regular Settings menu. It seems with each update a small group complain about Bluetooth issues. Another idea is to change location settings to “Battery Saver Mode” which uses WiFi and networks instead of GPS. As GPS drains battery with ease. If you’re in a poor service area, try flipping on Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode will kill all of your device’s settings but it could prevent drain. When you have no service the phone will constantly look for one, so turn on Airplane mode and save juice for later. Restart Your Nexus Occasionally apps will just start draining the battery, or even Android System and OS, when it shouldn’t. If I’ve removed my Nexus (or any Android) from the charger and it seems to be draining faster than expected, I do a quick reboot, which usually fixes the problem. Hold down the power button and turn it off, then back on, or hit reboot on select devices. This starts the entire system fresh, and can solve a lot of little bugs including bad Nexus battery life. It sounds silly, but I reboot my phone once every 2-3 days, for the best experience. Auto Brightness This is one everyone should know, and isn’t really a tip, but I constantly see users with a phone set around 90-100% brightness, or set to auto. Honestly, this isn’t needed and can really kill battery life. I keep all of my devices around 35-40% brightness, which is still plenty. Head into Settings > Display > and uncheck auto, then put the slider to a more manageable and realistic brightness setting. It may take a few hours to get used to the lower screen level, but your battery will thank you for it. Clear The Cache Partition If none of those work, you can take some more drastic steps towards fixing your bad Nexus Android Nougat battery life. One of those steps is clearing the cache partition. Clearing the cache has worked wonders in the past to fix poor Nexus battery life in general, and some stated it helped with the battery drain on the Nexus support forum. Here’s how to clear your cache partition: Press and hold Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously until you see something other than Google on the screen. You should see a large arrow at the top of the screen. Tap Volume Down repeatedly until you see Recovery in the arrow.  Then tap the Power button. You should see an android on his back, chest open with a red triangle and exclamation mark. While holding Power button tap Volume Up once then release the Power button. You should now see a list of items at top of screen and will be in “Recovery mode”. Tap Volume Down until you reach the option to clear cache partition. Tap the Power button to select, confirm by hitting yes, and let it finish. Progress messages will appear at the bottom of the screen. This should take less than a minute, but could take upwards of 10 minutes in some cases. Restart your Nexus This has shown to fix multiple small problems after a software update. From battery life to WiFi and Bluetooth issues, GPS glitches, and multiple other small things. We’d recommend doing this after any big update, so your Nexus can start with a clean slate. Factory Reset Your Device This is a last resort, but like clearing the Cache it’s also a great idea to truly start with a clean slate and wipe out any unwanted leftover files. Doing a factory data reset will erase everything, so backup any important files first, and be prepared to set aside an hour or so to set up your phone back to how it was. Most should know how to do a reset, if not, Google has put together an extensive guide that outlines the proper way to factor reset Nexus smartphones and tablets. Take a look at that information, backup your device, and get started. Downgrade to Marshmallow If you absolutely need better battery life and can’t fix it with any of these suggestions, and can’t wait for Google to release an update to Android 7.1.2 Nougat, some owners can always revert back to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. This guide explains how to manually install Android Nougat, but the same instructions (and factory images link) will allow users to download any version of Android 6.0 and install it within 10-15 minute. Use that to downgrade back to Marshmallow if you don’t need Nougat, and want better Nexus battery life. I wouldn’t recommend it, but to each their own. Other Ideas If none of this seems to work, try tracking down another fix. Google’s Nexus Help Forums are a great place to start. There are tons of helpful users on XDA-Developers not to mention custom 3rd party versions of Android you can install that may have better results. We’d also recommend getting a Portable Battery Pack that can recharge your device anywhere and everywhere, which isn’t ideal, but a great accessory to have anyways. We’ll be on the lookout for more complaints, details, possible fixes, and report back once we know more or hear of incoming updates. Are you experiencing bad Nexus Android Nougat battery life?

Tons of cases are available now, or will be coming soon. The Nexus 6P Folio Case comes in a beautiful refined leather design in brown or black color options. This is one of the few that is listed as coming soon, and arguable one of the best. It features cutouts for the front speakers, fingerprint scanner, all the ports, and has a magnet on the flip out cover to instantly wake the screen. It's an elegant case, but will be expensive. Coming Soon for $49.99   1 / 13 18 Responses 09/01/2016 Garry Reply It says wipe cache partition not clear cache partition. 09/03/2016 Cory O'Hara Reply Actually, I hated Android until right after nougat was installed I did a “non-restorative” factory reset for the first time since owning my Nexus 6 and the results are better than when first purchased! Battery life mixed/heavy usage is at better than 24 hours! (Non restorative, meaning factory reset but deselect the option to restore app data then wipe system cache after the reset). Used to have the terrible battery, camera and system lag with overheating. But now it literally is like a brand new phone. And this nougat with doze is kicking! Peace. ✌️ 09/14/2016 Dennis Fluttershy Reply With the latest beta; the Nexus 6 instantly shuts down when it reaches 15% and requires charging before being able to start up. Today, it instantly shut down at 75% and required charging before starting up. I charged it for a minute, and has now been able to drain it below 75% without any issue. But this is really annoying when going out, and it shuts down at 75%!! Maybe I need to do a factory reset. But I would also like to have the full release of Nougat first; and then do a full reset. 09/21/2016 saj Reply This is definitely a problem. Today is my first day on Nougat and the battery drain is very clear. Not using the device any differently. When I check battery settings, there is Android System and Android OS right at the top. I don’t have blue tooth on. Screen is at 5 percent. Its just terrible. First, was complaining that I didn’t have Nougat…and now I wish I never got it. And calling Google Support is useless. Those reps don’t know what they’re talking about and can’t resolve any problems. 09/23/2016 Nexusnoenergy Reply Bump #nougatbrokemyphone 09/24/2016 JacobP Reply So much complexity. I am glad I delayed the nougat update on my nexus phone. I have gotten my Marshmallow devices to do what I want and they all have a perfect battery life. I’ll let others to be guinea pigs for the 7.0, and will upgrade maybe a year later as it seems like Google has release yet another half baked Android update. 10/10/2016 Charles G Torrez Reply Found this on another website: “I FOUND OUT HOW TO STOP NEXUS 6P NOUGAT BATTERY DRAIN. go into developer options, disable automatic system updates, and disable always allow wifi roam scans. Restart. Fixed.” 10/19/2016 Joey Reply dont update to 7.0!!! my SOT went from 5hrs consistently to barely 3!!! Please fix this google 10/19/2016 Charles GT Reply Joey, in developer options, disable automatic system updates. This did the trick for me. Went from 7 hrs back to all day battery. 10/30/2016 Valery Reply I’ve tried everything, even so-called “developer options”, but nothing helps reach the goal with 6.0.1 or 7.0. When i first got the phone (nexus 5x), it was able to be working for 5-8 days!!! Yes, i am not very active user. 5-10 calls 10-20 min of music, 1-2 card transactions (i’m far more 40 ;-). AT LEAST 5 DAYS! The only thing that helped in my case was the downgrade to the oldest available 6.0.0! But even first upgrade of 6.0.0 applications (as well as google services) got my phone back to where i was before. DO NOT UPGRADE GOOGLE SERVICES AFTER YOU HAVE DOWNGRADED TO 6.0.0!! IT IS THE ROOT OF ALL PROBLEMS!! as i think ;-) 20+ hours of working-as-expected!! yahoooo! If you get upgraded to the next version of google services, remember that you can safely return to the original version. You just have to Disable-Remove Upgrade Google Services, and then re-Enable GS, as well as another google apps which functionality depends on G-services too much (calendar, disk, contacts, camera, gmail and some others). And the next fly in the plate of soup is the fact that you will be unable to install some newer apps from google (such as “Google duo”). Your choose. 11/05/2016 Valery Reply Unfortunately, my next experiment failed. After a few days, everything was as it was before flashing. Looks like Big Brother in my phone never sleeps. 11/06/2016 Margie Reply I am a Nexus 9 user and have had no issues till recently, Now I have Many, Bad battery Life? Yes Chrome suddenly stops working, when using any app it will suddenly just close. This happens daily, I have uninstalled google chrome did all that, did the updates, everything works fine for oh Maybe a day then back to All the problems. All very frustrating, thinking I should do a factory reset, don’t really want to, I mean the is November now I would think there would be some fixes for all these issues. ??At a Loss 11/11/2016 David H Byrne Reply That was profoundly informative… Thanks 👍 11/29/2016 Hazman Reply Fix battery drain Android OS and Android System bug using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPX74-htB0g 12/25/2016 Georg Hellerup Reply Well nougat 7.0 nearly killed the nexus 5x. The battery drained rapidly and the device refused to charge properly. I made a backup of the device as the first step. Then I used The Nexus Rootkit Tool ver 2.19 (latest). The device was rooted by following the given instructions in the tool. Then I waited for the device to come around and prepairing apps and the like. Then I flashed the build to ver 6.01 (last stable build stock ROM). Rebooted the device. The next step is very important. I configured the device as a new device.Wait for the device to fully prepare and install apks. DO NOT UPDATE before everything is updated an running in build 6.01 this includes all apks and wifi. The device might be stable at this point – however it may warn You of it being unable to check for corrupted software (unlocked bootloader) or even the device itself being corrupted at boot up. Just ignore it for the time being. With all the above done, then and only then I used the OTA update to ver 7.11. This worked for me. It takes some time. Patience is very impotant – don´t try to rush anything. I´ve tried a lot of different approaches. You should be able to relock the bootloader, however I went straight back into problems. Then again I can live with an unlocked bootloader which offers more possibilities/options including bricking again. I´ve not tested the method on other devices. In general You´ve got a fighting chance – if You can revert back to a stable release and get it running and proceed from there. The tools may vary a bit even for the same devices running the exact same builds. Some tools require the device to be only charging on USB – others MTP. Some tools may even use diffrent methods within the problemsolving – adb sideload, fastboot or download mode eg. You might even have to try different tools, one for fixing bootloader, another one for recovery eg. Trying different forums is a very good beginning when trying to figure out, what may work or not for Your specific model and/ROM/problems. Performing the above steps is at Your own risk. By performing the above steps You´ve readily accepted the risk of failiure and bricking the device. Failiure is always an option.. 12/25/2016 Georg Hellerup Reply 7.0 was one of the worst halfbacked upgrades I´ve ever seen. Even upgrading to 7.11 didn´t fix it. 7.11 is outperforming 6.0 any day. For the time being the only solution seems to be going back to 6.0 and upgrade directly to 7.11. – 7.0 is by all means a no go. Even upgrading to 7.11 can´t fix the mess left by 7.0 – The 7.11 is very impressive and improves battery life. I´ve seen the nexus 5 x go from less than 1 hr SOT to 4 hrs. 04/07/2017 Buizerd Reply Also in the new update 7.1.2 there is still he battery drain on my Nexus 6P when WIFI is on but not connected 04/15/2017 Mike Reply This article was useless. Doesn’t provide any solid ways to fix the actual issues. Just provides generic solutions applicable to any phone and any software.

Whether you are an enterprising app developer building the essential software to bring a virtual Taylor Swift into your Slack chats, or just lonely and in need of a dumb, annoying virtual friend to message you on Facebook, we seem to be clear on one thing: Many experiences, apps, sites, and products are going to be replaced with bots. (Unless they are being replaced with VR. Or AR. Or a typewriter keyboard for your iPhone.) It’s official: “Bot for X” is the new “Uber for X.” And sure, bots are cool. Ever since ELIZA struggled to pass the Turing Test and HAL 9000 murdered his crew (later reincarnated in a hardly remembered Apple Super Bowl commercial), we’ve been infatuated with the idea of computers as our inevitable sidekicks. Bots center around one specific niche aspect of artificial intelligence: conversational understanding. Human factors experts have long been enthralled by the idea that a more natural way to communicate with computers would be through speech, and we’ve spent the better part of a century building to a point where natural conversations may soon be a reality. While this is indeed an important step forward in human-computer interaction, it is truly just one small part of what AI is about — and not the part that will matter the most for the enterprise companies that actually buy almost $4 trillion in software and services each year. Bots are the new command line Today, most bots just provide a wrapper around existing functionality. In the early days of graphical user interface (GUI), the point-and-click interface provided different ways of achieving the same tasks you could do on the command line; now most bots provide an additional channel with which to do tasks you likely often do another way. Instead of speaking a specific sentence, you can open the Weather app on your iPhone. You can open your task list and type “Pay the power bill.” You could search Google for a viola joke. Many of today’s bots are kind of a hipster façade around the same basic command line interfaces consumers abandoned in the 1980s. They require specific syntaxes and understand only a limited vocabulary — but they sure have personality! format /q /fs:fat /v:mydisk wasn’t nearly this funny back in the day. Yes, Taco Bell really did this. While the added convenience of language recognition is a benefit, until bots are capable of performing very complex and novel tasks that richly combine actions and context across the boundaries of apps and sites in unique ways the first time they are asked, we will be limited to trying to remember the 489 commands Siri recognizes. (Yes that link is a man page for Siri.) The rise of headless AI But I’m not down on bots. I’m just a lot more excited by the less-flashy flavor of AI that is changing the nature of work itself: headless AI. Headless AI is the application of artificial intelligence to vastly improve internal business processes. It is fully transforming the crucial machinery of business — processes like hiring, lead generation, financial modeling, and information security. Legacy software has become a commodity in all of these areas, and purpose-built AI solutions will get a larger and larger wallet share of these huge enterprise cost centers. Headless AI combines machine intelligence and learning loops to constantly evolve. Because these solutions plug into the data lifeblood of a company, they become incredibly valuable as the algorithms adapt to the patterns that work. I call this form of AI “headless” because, unlike bots, the value is mostly not about the personality. Headless AI works with humans and augments their strengths. It doesn’t try to replace people; it gives them superpowers. While being able to talk to your CRM is cool, having a sales platform that accurately predicts the 100 opportunities you can close this quarter is worth breaking the bank for. Having a cute avatar answer your customer support chats seems nice enough, but predicting ahead of time what areas of your product will get support requests so that you can fix them before customers suffer is pure gold. It’s happening! (already) Though bots get all the glamour, headless AI is quietly happening everywhere already. These new platforms are generally purpose-built solutions optimized around specific domains and outcomes data. They learn not from people talking to them, but by voraciously chomping up all of the relevant proprietary data fed into them. The best systems employ learning loops and massive streams of incoming data to constantly improve. This creates a multiplier effect: The earlier and more pervasively an organization rolls out headless AI solutions, the more quickly the positive results compound. If you wait a year to deploy, you don’t just lose the year of improved productivity — you lose the year of learning and adaptation of the software to your company’s patterns. This puts you doubly behind. Companies like Apple, Expedia, and Johnson & Johnson use Textio’s augmented writing platform to chop weeks off the time it takes them to fill open jobs. DeepMind helped Google reduce power consumption in its data centers by 15 percent. A former NSA analyst created Area 1 Security to predict cyberattacks before they happen. These new headless AI companies, and dozens of others, are helping enterprises make the kind of radical productivity leaps that they haven’t seen from software in decades. Headless AI is where the money is I’m not sure if there’s a revenue model that works for bots. I guess we will see. People are trying to figure that out. I’m thankful I don’t have to! What I do know is that there is a lot of money to be made in transforming the efficiency of core enterprise functions. This is what headless AI is all about. If you can improve a crucial business process in a decisive way and by a clear and measurable amount, that is incredibly valuable. What is most game-changing about this kind of software is that it is purely quantitative. Unlike a bot, where the potential return on investment is fairly qualitative (“customers liked interacting with the bot”), most headless AI is fully in the realm of predicting the future and then helping you change that future. It’s focused where the return on investment is measurable and evident. Improving — in real life — the quantity, quality, and demographics of the people who walk through your front door with resumes in hand… how much is it worth to be able to hire better people more quickly than your competition? If you can predict exactly who will buy what, and when… how much could you improve your customer experience? Because this kind of software proves itself through the numbers, it is inherently valuable and easy to budget for. Headless is where the real AI money is. Headless AI everywhere In the near future, every core business function will have been transformed by AI — hiring, sales, security, marketing, finance, manufacturing… everything. Purpose-built headless AI platforms will provide the new infrastructure that will drive every business. The enterprises that are already on this train will continue getting an outsized advantage until everyone else catches up. Legacy software will get squeezed down into a smaller portion of the IT wallet as the most valuable services become the native AI platforms — just as form-based desktop software got squeezed out by the cloud in the last generation. Bots are here to stay. They’ll keep getting headlines. “OK Google, search for tacobot.” But the real enterprise revolution is happening in the companies that are using headless AI to transform their core businesses.

AFP 16 April 2017 - 06:57 print comments A recent survey found that 20% of American consumers are dissatisfied with their pay TV service, leaving the market ripe for change © (AFP) For years, US cable operators got rich by offering fat "bundles" of hundreds of channels and raising prices regularly for television consumers. Now the "skinny bundle" is disrupting that model with internet-delivered packages offering live and on-demand programs. Google's YouTube TV is the latest to enter this market with its bundle of around 40 channels for $35 monthly, challenging slim packages from Sony's PlayStation Vue, Dish Network's Sling TV and AT&T's DirecTV Now. More entrants are expected including one from streaming service Hulu. These services offer easy interfaces like those of on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, let viewers digitally store programs in the internet "cloud," and toss in a limited selection of live channels to sate news and sports or other interests. Skinny offerings are aimed at young viewers and "cord cutters" loath to pay $100 or more to be force-fed hundreds of channels in hefty bundles and accustomed to streaming shows they want, when they desire. A Parks Associates survey last month found 20 percent of American consumers dissatisfied with their pay TV service, leaving the market ripe for change. Analyst Glenn Hower at Parks said the market is in flux, with some consumers taking advantage of the easy sign-up for skinny packages, even though some cancel just as quickly. In addition to lower prices, he said, "you don't have to worry about sending out a technician, you don't have to worry about getting the equipment back." BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield, in a research note titled "the big bundle is doomed," says he expects skinny bundles to eat away at the established pay-TV providers. Established media companies are focusing too hard on "protecting their legacy business model" instead of giving consumers the flexibility they want, Greenfield wrote this month. Leichtman Research Group found that the top US cable companies lost 277,000 subscribers in 2016, while internet-delivered services like Sling TV and DirecTV Now added about 845,000. These shifts could lead to a huge upheaval in the television ecosystem, allowing more choices and lower costs for consumers in many cases, while leaving smaller, independent cable channels out in the cold. The skinny bundles "have made inroads in the past year," said Leichtman Research president Bruce Leichtman. Digital platforms rise Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said Google's entry into the business is significant because "for the first time, the broadcasters are letting a powerful digital platform have the keys to its treasure room: live, first-run TV shows." He noted that major tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft "have tried to cozy up to TV for many years now, and all of them have been rebuffed" until now. "The digital platforms are indeed taking over the world, this time with permission from their former adversaries," he said in a blog post. While many consumers use on-demand options like Amazon and Netflix, they often keep cable or satellite subscriptions for live sports and local news. But live channels will make streaming options more attractive. At the same time, popular channels such as HBO and sports programmer ESPN have been offering standalone subscriptions to allow consumers to watch without a bundle from cable or satellite. But independent television analyst Alan Wolk argues that the major pay TV firms remain in good shape despite these challenges. Some like AT&T already have a "skinny" offering, and others such as Comcast and Verizon are expected to enter the market to give consumers a choice. Wolk said consumers don't appear to be flocking to skinny bundles because "they pay 30 percent less dollars but get 70 percent less content." He added that "a lot of people think they want to cut back but when you ask them which channels they want to eliminate they have trouble cutting back to the bare minimum." Striking back Wolk noted that the large pay TV operators have an advantage because they offer broadband internet, and in some cases are the dominant provider in a region. This allows them to offer incentives which bundle internet and television. The large operators can also squeeze out rivals by using data caps or other means to favor their own streaming service, and will not likely face regulatory impediments from doing so in the current political environment, he said. Operators are also keeping customers with "TV everywhere" which allows subscribers to watch the same content on mobile devices or while traveling, he noted. One impact from the shift to streaming is that providers will know more about customer habits, to be able to deliver advertising targeted to each user. That's positive for marketing, but could be a privacy worry as tech firms build up detailed profiles on consumers. Google in particular can refine its ad model by using data on viewing habits, analysts note. With streaming, Wolk said, Google and others "get a ton of data about users and what they are up to, and they can cross-reference that with your browsing habits."

April 14th 2017 3 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Despite marketing like this, Calvin Klein is uncool (according to teens). Picture: Calvin Klein/Facebook Jason Murphynews.com.au@jasemurphy Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend TEENAGERS are so hard to understand. A huge new survey of what teens think is cool is only adding to the confusion. Apparently, teens think Red Bull is less cool than Costco? That Sony is less cool than Microsoft? That Levis’ are less cool than HP? It’s like they’re deliberately trying to troll their parents’ generation. The survey — run by Google — is full of weird comparisons like this. The following chart shows all the brands, from dorky on the left to cool on the right. The vertical axis shows how well known the brands are. It’s hard to see, but the coolest and most well known brands are Youtube, Netflix and Google, while among the least cool are TMZ, The Wall Street Journal and Yahoo.Source:Supplied If you look closely, you will notice a few things that are seriously suspicious. Do today’s youth really worship Google so much? The survey asks the kids (aged 13-17) to rank 122 brands by how cool they are. And Google-owned brands come out with curiously high rankings. The coolest thing in the whole world, according to Google’s survey, is YouTube: owned by Google. Third coolest is Google itself, while Google Android, the phone operating system, and Nest, Google’s smart thermostat company, both take home decent scores. Something is screwy there. We should probably ignore the Google effect, and when we do, we see patterns that actually make sense. I HATE YOU MUM AND DAD! The worst thing a brand can be is something your parents are into. Case in point: Facebook. Teens pretty much hate Facebook. It shows up in the survey, where, sure, Facebook is something they’ve heard of, but it scores awfully. The problem for 13-to-17 year olds is their parents are on Facebook, and it is cramping their style. Facebook messenger scores even worse with the kids, and I imagine that’s because they associate it mainly with messages that look something like this: Mum: Reminder: come straight home from school today because you have to do your homework. Luv u, x. Teens’ playgrounds are Snapchat and Instagram instead of Facebook, but the complaints are beginning as parents converge on Instagram too. Both of my parents follow me on Instagram. I've now lost two platforms. Twitter is my last bastion of free speech. Dicks— Brennen Spangler (@BrennenSpanglr) April 10, 2017 Both of my parents are on Instagram now so I guess it's time I just throw my phone in a lake.— Hunter (@hunter3124) April 1, 2017 (This could actually be a good explanation for the seemingly crazy popularity of YouTube and Netflix — they are something teens can engage with away from prying eyes.) The daggiest brand in the whole survey is the Wall Street Journal. I personally love the Wall Street Journal, but I understand it is not cool (and also that I am not cool) so its low score gives the whole thing credibility. What’s less expected is that the media brand Vice does so badly. You may have noticed the new SBS channel called Viceland. That’s the same Vice that the teens say is dorky in the survey. It’s a weird result given how much effort Vice is putting in to be edgy. It’s a bit of a mystery and there is definitely some skew in the results where well-known brands also seem to be scoring as cooler than less well-known ones. WHY SHOULD WE CARE WHAT THESE PIMPLY INFANTS THINK ANYWAY? I personally hate the idea that we need to find out what pathetic ideas are swimming round in the jelly brains of these fat and spoiled American children, but the reality is the little morons matter. American teenagers are one of the driving forces of the world economy. If you want to know what brands and companies are going to be big you need to tune your antenna to what they like. Soft drink brands and blue jeans, rock music and skateboarding — so much of what we call popular culture got its start with teens before crossing over to the mainstream. So if you’re trying to invest, or make choices about what to study or where to work, you’ll do better if you keep an eye on the things American teens think are cool. What teens think is cool. Blue for boys, pink for girls.Source:Supplied Jason Murphy is an economist. He publishes the blog Thomas The Thinkengine.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Now that Pixel 2 is under works, we think it’s safe to say that Google is looking to part ways with the Nexus brand. However, this shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone since Google has showed interested to pursue its own path in the smartphone industry for a while now. As everyone knows, Nexus smartphones have been created in collaboration with other companies and they don’t exactly represent “pure” Google devices. Nokia Smartphones On the bright side though, it looks like Nokia’s smartphones are just the right candidates to replace the Nexus lineup. The Finnish manufacturer decided to make a comeback into the smartphone world this year under the stewardship of HMD Global. Fortunately, Nokia’s comeback has been well received by tech fans. In fact, retailers have been having problems keeping up the supply of Nokia smartphones since they sell so well. Android OS The reason why Nokia smartphones are the perfect candidates to replace Google’s older Nexus smartphones is because all of them run on stock Android OS. In addition, Per Ekman who is HMD Global’s Vice President has announced that Nokia smartphones are always going to be kept up to date with all of Google’s updates. In fact, Per Ekman stated the following “We and Google will jointly enhance the Nokia brand to put the right kind of inputs into the phone, including Google Assistant”. At the moment, customers can purchase Nokia 3, 5 and 6, but we can be sure that Nokia’s smartphone range is going to increase along the way. Considering that Nokia’s brand name is worldwide recognizable and that Google benefits from the same global recognition as well, we can be sure that all of Nokia’s upcoming smartphones are going to be successful. Premium Hardware Last but not least, the Finnish manufacturer has also equipped its smartphones with the latest hardware parts and not just software updates. For example, Nokia 6 and Nokia 5 are powered by the same Qualcomm octa-core Snapdragon processor that’s been clocked at 1.4GHz and an Adreno 505 graphics processing unit.

The new update came along with several bug fixes and improvements. A new report suggests that the company plans on bringing a desktop client to the app soon. Several weeks back, Google’s VP of Communications Products, Nick Fox released a teaser, suggesting the arrival of web client for Allo. According to 9to5Google, just like WhatsApp, Allo’s latest version has options for pairing the smartphone with the web client by simply scanning the QR code. Moreover, users can also use the text code method to pair the device. Unfortunately, there are a few limitations to the new addition. For instance, the device requires to be in vicinity when users are setting it up with the desktop. Plus, data connection should be present on both devices in order to connect.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 87 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares231 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball. We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2.

And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 133 Plus 1 on G+ 291 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares505 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 3 [Deal Alert] Staples has the Lenovo ThinkPad Chromebook 11e for $140 ($210 off) 2017/04/16 1:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] The first episode of Doctor Who season 10, plus the first episode of Class (a spinoff), are free on Google Play 2017/04/16 8:33am PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 104 Share on Facebook 68 Share on Twitter Total Shares203 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Đức Thành I guess you missed the part where I said 6 smart home devices weren't any where near enough. Bring me 16 and we're talking. :D Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library. Paul Quinn I can access a single song, an album, any of my playlists, or a Google Music Playlist. I can access music from my library or from Play Music's entire catalog. I am subscribed to Google Play Music. It's possible you are seeing this if you do not have a subscription. However, you should be able to access Google's curated lists. Michael I do have the subscription. I find this really odd. Can you verify you are able to play a song that exists only in your library and not available from Play Music? How did you ask for it to be played? I have a song in my library called Alligator.MP3 as well as many others and she cannot play it. There is an entire thread on this feature not being available so I would really appreciate it if you can double check. Thanks https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/googlehome/zC9dUi3FUsk/3W6KPacnAgAJ Paul Quinn I stand corrected! It is difficult to find songs only in my library and not in GP's library but I found a couple and it will not play them on the Home. That link in the product forum has an answer that says it should work. Am I reading that wrong? It's marked as "Best Answer." Michael Well, it should work if/when Google supports it. The bad thing is they are completely mum on the subject and won't really commit on it. People who report it are being given the old "we'll send your feedback to to the developers​.". Every other Android device works as we expect it to but not Home. It will only play your playlists and that doesn't depend on the subscription.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube Google’s new Chrome update has the one new feature you’ve been waiting for Chris Smith @chris_writes April 12th, 2017 at 7:18 PM Share Tweet Ever found yourself scrolling through a web page only to discover it would jump back to the top once it actually finished loading a slow element? Well, Google thinks that’s an annoying problem that needs fixing, and now the Chrome browser will finally fix it for you. Don't Miss: It looks like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design might be even more impressive than the iPhone 8 Google explained in a blog post that a new feature called scroll anchoring will prevent such behavior in the future, especially on mobile devices. “These annoying page jumps typically happen when the website inserts an image or other content above the visible area, pushing down what’s on the screen,” Google said. “With the newest Chrome update, we’re introducing something called scroll anchoring, which locks the content you’re currently looking at to the screen, keeping you in the same spot so you can keep reading.” The best part here is that Google will also fix an unwanted side effect of page jumping. Page jumps can cause accidental clicks on certain links on a page. You may want to click a specific link only to find that you’re heading in a different direction thanks to a page jump that forced you to tap or click the wrong link. That may even have some serious security implications when loading shady pages with links to even more suspicious places — hey, it can happen. In a nutshell, the new scroll anchoring feature will let you continue to read the article you were scrolling and click on the links you wanted to access in the first place without having to deal with any page jumping. Here’s the feature in action on Android: Tags: Android, chrome, google View Comments Trending 1 Entertainment These are the Netflix originals generating the most buzz online 2 Deals Say goodbye to broken charging cables with this 2-pack of metal braided lightning cables 3 Tech Google Photos will now stabilize your shaky smartphone videos 4 Tech How one man built his own iPhone out of spare parts 5 Deals You can’t go wrong with any of these Alexa-enabled smart thermostats Picked For You The Nokia 9 may look even better than the Galaxy S8 By Chris Smith April 14th at 8:00 PM This is what the iPhone 8 will look like if this morning’s leak was real By Zach Epstein April 13th at 12:18 PM The new MacBook Pro has a shiny new problem By Chris Smith April 13th at 6:49 PM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

By: Shilpa Published: Sunday, April 16, 2017, 8:00 [IST] After the release of Android 7.1.2, all were anticipating this build to appear on their smartphone sometime soon. Finally, Google' s Android smartphones started receiving this update and users were happy to use all the new features bundled in this package. But now there arises a new set of problem among Google's Pixel and Nexus users. They started reporting the bugs which have caused fingerprint sensors to break. Fingerprint sensors are one among many key features of a smartphone. Especially after this feature got introduced in the phone segment, everyone started ignoring other commonly used security features. Also Read: Google Pixel series smartphones get Wi-Fi calling on Reliance Jio Networks Similar kind of problems has been reported on Google's support forum by many users. Some even stated that they noticed the problem in fingerprint scanner after upgrading their Android Operating system to latest version 7.1.2. They even said that safe mode or factory reset could not solve this issue. Some even reported that after upgrading to this version, they were not able to see an option for fingerprint unlocking in device's setting menu. Even the users of Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P handset faced the similar problem and joined this bug reporting thread by stating the issue faced by them.

Still, it is not clear what exactly caused this problem but everyone is expecting this issue to be solved as soon as possible. Google may come up with the fix in next week or so.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 133 Plus 1 on G+ 291 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares505 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 3 [Deal Alert] Staples has the Lenovo ThinkPad Chromebook 11e for $140 ($210 off) 2017/04/16 1:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] The first episode of Doctor Who season 10, plus the first episode of Class (a spinoff), are free on Google Play 2017/04/16 8:33am PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Google Voice gets its first feature update since being revived Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/03/16 2:17pm PDTMar 16, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 84 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares194 Applications Google News Google Voice was waning a few weeks ago, then Google suddenly brought it back and gave it a fresh coat of paint. That was just the first step, though. Google promised it would continue updating Google Voice, and indeed it is. There's a new update rolling out today with more conversation management options, GIFs, and more. Here's the full list of new features (Android and web) Google posted on the product forums. Delete Conversations - You can now delete entire conversations on Android and Web. To delete an entire conversation, click the conversation > click More > Delete. Note that there is no trash and deletes cannot be undone.  Individual messages in a conversation can still be deleted by long pressing on a message in the mobile apps or right clicking on Web. Conversation delete will be coming to iOS in the near future. Calling on Web - You can now "make a call" from the updated version of the web interface to any number/contact. Do Not disturb - We’ve added the ability to toggle Do Not Disturb on/off on Android. When Do Not Disturb is enabled, call and text message forwarding will be paused and there will be a banner to indicate that it is turned on. To set a timer on Do Not Disturb, you will still need to visit the Legacy Google Voice on Web. Disable app notifications for text messages (Android Only) - Avoid duplicate notifications if you have message forwarding enabled. Conversation archive shortcut (Android Only)- Long-press on a conversation in the messages list to bring up the archive option. Gif image search - You can now search for Gifs if you use Gboard on Android. The ability to delete conversations is long overdue. There's no trashcan, so deleted conversations are gone forever. Conversations can also be archived via a long-press if you think you might need them again. Do Not Disturb mode can be toggled from the app as well. For Gboard users, the built-in GIF search feature works in Google Voice now. If you were hoping for Project Fi support, sorry. It's still not available. The updated app is rolling out, but you can grab it right now on APK Mirror if you're impatient.

All calls you make from the stock dialer should route through your Google voice number after this. The only reason I use the Hangouts dialer is so I have the option of making voice calls on my Pixel C tablet. ProductFRED No, I want VOIP. Not calling over the carrier network. Josh Woodby If you make a call using the regular dialer, the option will immediately switch to using your Google Voice instead. This IS actually VOIP. So, I don't see your issue. What I want is the ability to receive calls directly within the App without the need to forward calls to the carrier. That.... That is what is missing. Outgoing has always been achievable using the aforementioned method. Ryan Cavitt Actually it is not VoIP. You can tell by enabling airplane mode, reenabling Wi-Fi, then disabling Wi-Fi calling if you have it enabled. You will notice the call fails which indicates it is not VoIP. If it was the very fact that your phone is not connected to your cellular provider in anyway should not matter as it should be able to use any connection as long as it is a connection to the internet. You know like using Hangouts Dialer currently does. Ryan Its not VOIP, its a forward. Bruce Why do you want to use VOIP? Are you paying for carrier voice calls? Didn't think this was an issue in the US. Railwayman I want to use VoIP since I use data plans only without any carrier talk and text. Don't forget that GV over VoIP also work over non US SIM cards, which is the beauty of it. So yes, Google should integrate Hangouts Dialer into the refreshed GV app. ProductFRED Because then I can use my Google number over Wifi or anywhere in the world. Additionally, it makes sense since even native calls are becoming VoLTE (which is VoIP). Robb B. Screenshot of settings for phone apk on pixel XL. Setup SIP account and make primary. Then you'll be able to use GV with VoIP. Currently and always, GV never did stand alone VoIP on Android. Only Apple. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5dd6cf43950d187c0d8498d02da5436a87d23097d32844f6e8fe5202663c1281.png Gfame103 GV was a stand alone VoIP service back between 2010-2012 (Android only). I used to use it to receive and make free unlimited calls before the feature was taken away. Robb B. It was never stand alone. You always had to use IPKall or some other SIP service. Look at the early days of my app installs. They were all apps to provide sip functions with GV. You had to have another solution. Apple app was the only actual VoIP but was never ported to Android. Show me proof that you used GV without a fake sip number from any other provider or I call BS. BlazeKing I only used Groove IP to use GV as VoIP before GV stopped using the SIP ptotocol (rendering Groove IP's main attraction useless the time). What are you talking about, exactly? Picaso86 How can I setup a SIP Account to use GV through the Phone Dialer? Bryan Wagoner You can make voip calls using your gvoice phone number through hangouts at least. Carson Saldanha I'd like to be able to receive calls in the Google Phone app. They allow you to dial from it, but you can't receive any. Kerry Webb You can if you register for a Google voice phone number. Picaso86 Wait... you can use Google Voice through the native dial app? is that what you saying? Kerry Webb Yes you can. I do it almost every day Picaso86 Do you mind sharing on how you did it? Kerry Webb I did this almost 5 years ago. As memory serves, I went to the web interface after getting my Google number. Forwarded all Google voice calls to my cell number. For outgoing, I set voice to ask me if I want to use voice every time I make a call. I also changed my default voicemail to be Google voice as well. There's other tweaks you can do like waiting so many rings before forwarding calls etc. Carson Saldanha I have a Google Voice number already. DaveH I'm with you. Just waiting for VoIP dialing so I can leave Hangouts. b00sted i use GV for work and would always have to login to it on desktop mode to forward the vm as a email to m boss (pain but at least I could do it) now with the refresh unless I am missing something they took that away. Moshe Brevda Still waiting for the international calling rates to be brought into the current decade EnerJi Just curious, where are you calling that the rates are not competitive? I freely admit I haven't kept up with VoIP price comparisons since GV first introduced international calling, but I just checked the prices to some of the countries I occasionally call, and they don't seem too bad. tim242 It's sad that deleting a conversation wasn't there from the start, and is an added feature. Now I'm wondering if heads up is an unwanted feature. It is ridiculous that heads up can now only be disabled in messaging apps if you silence notifications altogether. I also hate how this app just picks random bubble colors. If only bubble colors could be customized. They are driving me to iOS. Jay I don't know anyone who's "accidentally" deleted an entire conversation instead of deleting a single message or messages. To say this was long overdue is a total understatement. Joshua Mize If I downloaded an APK in the past, does my app still automatically update through Google Play for future updates? Zachary Haddenham Yes. Dima Ivaȵov GV also supports mms messaging from the app now ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You're a little late to the party on that one Brad Stewart Needs ability to be set as default SMS app. Google Assistant texting is useless without it. tim242 It doesn't do SMS. So there is no way it can be a default SMS app. It is basically an instant messenger with a phone number attached. Kyle Salewski It could be if they wanted to. Hangouts is set to my default SMS app for my GV #, not my carrier number. So if I hit the send SMS button from the Contacts app, or another app, it starts a new SMS from my GV # (which you label instant messenger) inside of Hangouts. We should be able to do the same thing from the Voice app... tim242 Incorrect. Hangouts is only abke to be set as the default SMS client, because it is able to handle carrier SMS. Before they had carrier SMS in Hangouts, it could not be set as default. The fact that you use GV in Hangouts is irrelevant to the SMS side of Hangouts. Bruce I'm afraid you are wrong. I have been using GV since at least 2008. That's the only number I give out and I had been using it as my default SMS app for years. About 2-3 years ago, they stopped the GV app to be made the default SMS app. So now I can't tap on a direct contact widget and send an SMS through my GV app (and number) which is the only (mobile) number that people have of mine. So annoyingly I have to open the GV app to send an SMS to people. Alternatively, it would be nice if they would have allowed me to use my GV number as my mobile number in their SMS app (Messenger). That also used to work in earlier versions of Android. I used to use my GV number as my mobile number in Handcent. tim242 You are confusing GV messages with SMS. SMS messages are sent over the carrier network used for calls, and are limited to 160 characters. Google Voice messages are sent over the data network and have no character limit. When you send a message from Google Voice to someone's SMS, Google is rerouting it for you. What you are referring to is choosing Google Voice as your preferred way to send messages. That is not the same as a default SMS app that handles all messages. Thisismyusername1982 It does not need to be able to do SMS to send messages from Assistant. I don't use SMS in hangouts I use my Google Voice account and Hangouts its self and sending messages works just fine. So i don't see why it would not work for the Google Voice app. tim242 A default SMS app and using Assistant to send messages are two different things. Hangouts is an instant messenger, Google Voice is an intant messenger. Hangouts also has a separate SMS for carrier component. That is the only reason Hangouts can be set as the default SMS client. Google is going to cut that out, though. They are pushing SMS users to Android Messages, formerly Google Messenger. So when they remove that functionality, Hangouts will no longer be able to be set as a default SMS client. Allo has no SMS support, and the new GV app can't do VOIP GV calls. I wouldn't hold my breath for GV integration with Assistant. Google has fucked up the Android messaging world, and they don't seem to care johnforamerica Well holy shit... Didn't see that one coming twaddington Too little too late, I already ported my number out. pfmiller Are they finally going to fix the bug where I can't use my GV voicemail with my mobile number without either having to put up with my phone ringing twice, or blocking calls to my GV number? It's only been about 7 years since it worked right. Justin W I've had no issue with seeing my GV as my voicemail as a T-Mobile, Straight talk, or Cricket user. Ismael Rodriguez I think he may be referring to how if you set Hangouts to receive calls/msgs from Voice, when your phone transfers to voicemail, it will go to Hangouts and ring there first. I've always had the same issue. pfmiller Right. It worked for me when I first got my Nexus One, but then they made some big change to Google Voice and it's been broken ever since. Computator If you are describing what I think you are, it's the same situation I have and easy to fix. All you need to do is either turn off forwarding to your mobile number, or turn off receiving google voice calls in hangouts on your phone. Just choose which is enabled based on whether you want to receive calls over the cellular network or in hangouts instead of both. pfmiller The problem is I don't want to choose one or the other. Computator That's the entire point of gv, is it forwards to all of your phones (even if multiple of those "phones" happen to be the same phone), and you can answer from any of them. If you don't answer on one of them, the others will keep ringing until it goes to voicemail. That's by design, but even if they wanted to, they can't make it stop ringing on all phones if you dismiss it on one of your phones. When you dismiss a call, the other end does not receive any information saying you dismissed the call, it just knows you didn't answer. As such, GV has no way to know that you dismissed a call vs your phone was turned off, out of range of a cell tower, you just didn't answer, etc... That said, that capability would be nice if it were possible... pfmiller It used to work right, and now it doesn't. That's all I can say. John Repetti Not switching back until there's a migration tool to move my Google Voice messages out of Hangouts and back into Google Voice. JW I am with you. I wanted to get rid of Hangout with one less app on my phone but I don't want to lose all the messages from last years. One of Google's problem is they have too many teams doing different products for the same function (e.g. messages, navigation) and worse part is those teams are not talking to each other and sharing technology. zach v Don't cry okay? DaveH They are, at the very least, in Gmail. I agree with you but wouldn't hold my breath for that migration tool. Alex Wiesen We are working migrating that data, actually. But there's a lot, so it'll take some time. DaveH http://i.imgur.com/gff5bDf.gif How about VOIP so I don't have to use hangouts? Junt Thank fuck they fixed the double notifications Allen Cross ..Amen to that, But as so often happens with GVoice, it's one step forward and a half-step (at least) back. The update borked my 'Always Ask' setting on a Nexus 5. I want the option of not using Voice for some calls. Until the update, this worked just fine, Now, my Google dialer always tries (and fails) to use Voice before finally giving me the option to use the carrier number. . ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Deleting each text to get rid of the conversation was just plain stupid. I am glad they're letting you delete the whole thing. tim242 But not by long pressing the thread. SMH Bruce This! Right now I have disabled all updates to GV from Titanium Backup. I'm still using the older version. The inability to delete messages was a major reason. Until I get at least deletes on long press and ideally bulk deletes from the list like deleting emails, I'm sticking with the older version. Couldn't care less about MMS and any other UI enhancements they have added at the expense of functionality. tintin.92 What do you guys mean by project fi support? Isn't fi basically the same thing? bozzykid Fi uses Google Voice as the backend but you can't use the GV app for texting. There is lots of speculation that Google is going to be adding Fi support to this app since Hangouts seems to be moving to an enterprise tool. tintin.92 What is the advantage to using the GV app for texting? Texting through your computer? Bruce Yes. Plus, at least for me, that's the only number I give to people. This allows me to be totally independent of carriers, phones, mobile plans etc. I can change providers whenever I want and I simply change the number to forward the call to from my GV setting. Since this is the only number that people have, it's essential that text messages show up as coming from my GV number which people think is my mobile number. I never used that absolute rubbish Hangouts, but free texting (back in the say when carriers used to charge for SMS) and a single number made GV a killer app and one of the many reasons to use Android for me. The Seventh Son They still haven't brought the widget back :( I use GV for voicemail on my main phone and really need the widget to keep track of voicemails hopefully it's in the next update. Chris Skaryd Still missing the widget. :( XgudwilX Why would i want Project Fi support? Hangouts is way better. Hangouts makes calls, texts(sms/mms), video chat, hip and cool GIF's..even some sweet ass stickers. Am I supposed to need another app for my phone number. I even have Allo and Duo for when I'm really bored. Zack Where's Data Calling? And removing the damn SMS Spam Detection system that bans me for 24 hours often? Rod Moore "Calling on Web" What is new here? I don't recall when I couldn't call on my laptop with GV. This is like people saying "You can now send money through Gmail." That is not new either. I done that for years. Sending money through the Gmail Android App is new. Adam Margeson The website for updated with the app refresh and, in typical Google fashion, one of the features that didn't make it into the refreshed interface was the call-a-number feature. That has now been added back in. skeeterfood This version also works with it set to make all calls through Google Voice on my Honor 8. The prior version required me to set it to ask every time or all calls would fail. EarlyMon That was caused by Phone Manager and its services btw. mcdonsco I've been thinking of porting my number to Google voice, but concerned that calls may not be reliable/clear??? I use my phone for my business and thus it had to be reliable and clear. Does GV just forward calls to the cell # that your carrier gave you or is it primarily voip.? Computator It was originally intended to be just call forwarding, and the voip option was added later. I mostly use it with forwarding, and have had no issues with clarity or reliability. I use voip every once in awhile, and it is usually pretty clear as well. mcdonsco And you're using it as your primary number? As in, doesn't matter what your carrier associated number is because you don't use that? Computator Yes, that's correct. I've been doing that for more than five years, and with multiple carrier phone numbers. No one has my carrier number(s) Dee Mann Does your carrier still charge you for minutes used for calls and SMS sent? Or is it all free through GV Computator I use hangouts or the Google voice app to send SMS messages using my Google voice number, so that uses the data network and not carrier sms. For calls, I usually answer from my cellular number which does use carrier minutes of course. However, you can also answer calls in hangouts using VoIP, which uses the data network (or wifi), and hence does not use any carrier minutes. That is what I do with my tablet and my laptop. Picaso86 I want to use the Phone Dialer as my GV. I have a data only plan and its very annoying to use Hangouts Dialer. The UI is horrible in order to dial a contact.... I heard people creating SIP accounts to do this. Any ideas? Computator You used to be able to use GV with SIP accounts, but they removed that functionality several years ago. There are not really any other options for using the native dialer with Google voice. If you want to use the native dialer it pretty much has to go over cellular. You can however use the Google voice app or website interface to call someone. It will ask which phone you want to call them with, and then GV will call you at the number you select. Once you answer, it will connect you to the other person. Hangouts is one of the options to have it call you with, at least on the web version (you can answer that on any of your devices with hangouts of course​). They might have the option to call you on Hangouts in the app as well, but I don't have the version of the app that lets you "make a call" yet. Victor Fantus Will Sprint start allowing there #s on Google Voice again? Miles Reiter Do they not do that anymore? I must be grandfathered in. Charley Birkner Seems they removed the ability to forward/email messages with this update. Searching for instructions on how to do this results in going to the hamburger menu and selecting the legacy/classic version, *sigh* darrsil Still no fix for Google Voice voicemail not working in the Dialer app. Adam Margeson What are you talking about? Just set Google Voice to always be used and the dialer will use it. Or, if you don't want it all the time, set it to ask. darrsil I'm talking about Google Voice VOICEMAIL, not Google Voice calling. It's been broken in the Google Phone app since they redesigned the Google Voice app. Adam Margeson Sorry about that. I had read that "Google Voice" wasn't working. Didn't see the "voicemail" there. My mistake. Rann Xeroxx Deleting (anything) out of Google products is purposely onerous and time consuming. There is not a "delete all" messages, only the ones on the screen. And when you delete, they go into the trash where they live forever. You then have to do into there to delete them forever. Note that even performing this delete is performed in the Legacy GVoice, the new GUI has very piss poor options. Adam Margeson Then keep up on your messages better? It's only if you let them really build up that it becomes an issue. I say that as someone who does let them build up. LG71 I'm getting error with updated client. Anybody else? Milan Hollie How to add contacts Adam Margeson With the contacts app, not GV. Phillip Mitchell I got a new pixel XL a few weeks ago and I can't fucking get Google Voice to act as my voicemail. I'm back to regular caveman voicemail and I can't for the life of me figure out how to fix it and I'm fucking losing my mind. please help.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

[Update: Google resolves endless OTA loop] Google is updating Nexus 6P beta testers to the final 7.1.2 build [OTA Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/12 6:00pm PDTApr 12, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares285 Device Updates Downloads Google News Nexus 6P Nexus Devices Nougat 7.0/7.1 Update 1: 2017/04/12 6:04pm PDT Issues with beta OTAs Google's Android beta program allows the more intrepid among you to take a first crack at new updates, but it can be a little irksome to then move to the final build. For example, the 7.1.2 testers are still running the beta while the final version has rolled out to non-testers. Now, it looks like Google has started updating the beta build to final, but only for the Nexus 6P so far. The update clocks in at a mere 25.4MB, which isn't surprising. You're only going from 7.1.2 to a slightly different 7.1.2. The build number when all's said and done will be N2G47H. That's the same build that rolled out to non-testers. There should not be any feature differences between the two versions, but being on the right build means you'll be able to get OTA updates going forward. We don't yet know if this is rolling out to everyone, but check your update menu to be safe. If it's not there, we've got the URL of the OTA on Google's servers. Feel free to sideload it if you can't wait, but remember this is only for the 6P. Hopefully other devices on the beta get updates soon. Update 1: 2017/04/12 6:04pm PDT Issues with beta OTAs We got numerous reports earlier than phones were being offered another update to the beta build after installing the final one. Google neglected to flip some switch on its end to prevent phones from getting the beta OTA again, but that should be fixed now.

JD 1313 Deadend Drive? Manard After taking this update I immediately get offered a new beta-N2G47I. Xious That's the same beta build that is on my Pixel. wjrandon Beta for life. x8123999 Pixel C just got it, too. Build N2G47D. Brian Langlois I got this update. then promptly got the notification that the system update NPG47I was available. Installed that. Then promptly got the notification that This update (N2G47H) was available. It just keeps prompting to update inthenickoftime4 Same MichaelFranz same, but i didnt install the NPG47I. victor sanchez same here. Серёжа Дураков same Jean-Pierre Tavan Same... VAL Same here, weird Brianna D Green Mine did this as well but once your on the (N2G47H), just reset the phone and then go into the update screen in settings and the (NPG47I) update notification disappears. At least it did for me. Lol. James Brown What do you mean by "reset the phone." I have rebooted and gone into settings/system updates but I still get the prompt to download the previous version. Brianna D Green I rebooted after the new update and then once back in the phone, went to the update screen and notification disappeared after hitting check for update. James Brown Didn't work for me. Minty Yeah I think it's happening to everyone. I just let it put me back on to stable again and then unenrolled from the beta program so I would stop getting them. T4rd It's times like this when I'm glad I'm just on Pure Nexus ROM. =p Vedang Jadhav This is new loop man, If you are not getting bootloop, Google is ensuring you atleast get this loop!! danthepotato Thank god I'm not the only one... I tried using the chat help on the settings. The guy basically told me I should opt out of beta, but I don't want to wipe my phone... JamesBennett360 If you update then opt out it will not wipe your device. I did it myself Carolacoffman Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sw301c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Good to go VAL just unenrrolled the beta program and won´t show up F4LL0U7 Same. I'll just deal with the update icon for now until they fix it. Not interested in unenrolling and wiping my phone. rasty++ no wipe if you have n2g... Ronald Yup same issue, did the update got the notification downloaded the NPG47I but have not installed it yet Josh Hamer Yup, same thing happening to me Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google employs only the best and brightest. André Pudiesi Same here. Final, then prompted me the Beta again. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b59969b13e033f7b043512da60a6f94086726e1588fc48382fcdd40bcad52140.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0da4868bacccbb1d7ce49e3c804e23e92904bd5251a4eebb9a7de486b9d3aa17.png Curt Same. LondonLeedsFan Right.... So i got the stable build (25mb), and the beta build 1313.6mb straight after... I'm confused?! Midnitte Want the next update? Now, always have an update available! Chisel I'm also getting the NPG47I «--» N2G47H loop. Weird. phineasjw Yep. Same thing. Took the opportunity to leave the Beta program. Just make sure you leave when running N2G47H. tonyc That's the same thing that keeps happening to me. Garry I just cleared the app data for Google Play Services and so far that has alleviated the problem. Artem Russakovskii Google fixed the endless loop, guys. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/6504su/anyone_else_get_a_stable_712_update_then/dg6oj2l/. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Same update for Nexus 5x alexus after I pulled this update, I got another one right after (build NPG471) Mitch G yeah, it keeps pushing old build on top of new build TxReplay Got it on Nexus 5X too ! clay hope this fixes the shutdowns when there is clearly battery left. my phone shuts down when it hits 15% left and wont turn back on until i charge K9 A bit off topic i haven't recieved assistant yet and i was thinking it was cause i was in beta. I just got the stable 7.1.2 but still no assistant. Services apps is up to date but nothing still. Wht shd i do? Carson Saldanha Is your Google app on English (US)? K9 Yes it is Carson Saldanha rip idk lol rasty++ stop ota please ..8 ota in 2 hours.. -.- Kyle Smith Got this on Nexus Player also, I like the new update animation and loading bar Ernie If you update to N2G47H and you are on the beta program. You will have to unenroll from the beta. rmagruder Just spotted this and unenrolled from the beta and annoying update message went away. Guess I'll stay out of the beta until they actually push out the next beta. 2 Men-E ...sooooo...after the comments, and selecting "Download", but before selecting "Install"...I shouldn't complete the update to this "final" 7.1.2 build [being that my 6P will just do OTA loops] 🤔 rmagruder Good LORD, Google. I just got this on my 6P. It updated the phone, and after rebooting with the final 7.1.2, it promptly gave me a new System update available message wanting to install a beta version of 7.1.2 (HPG47I) at a hefty cost of 1313.6Mb. What the heck? That was what I was JUST ON before getting the FINAL OTA. George Hadjidakis Just opt out from the beta program then back in and then out again and it will go.. Bruno Montini To everyone getting the update prompt again and again, clear cache partition, it fixed it for me I also left the beta before clearing cache Lateef Alabi-Oki If you "Check For Update" on the Nexus 5x you might get it too. I got it that way. Tim Meader Once you have the official update (installed) and have booted back up... just IGNORE the prompt to update back to the beta version. Go into the Beta Program settings and leave the program. Problem solved. F4LL0U7 I'm not looking to factory reset OR leave the beta program though... I'd imagine they have to fix this if so many people are getting it, right? Tim Meader There's no need to be in the beta program right now since there's no actual beta. You can easily go back to it at any time via the same method, that's not an issue. It takes 5 seconds to sign back up. As I said, if you've already installed the release update and rebooted, leaving the beta won't factory reset anything. F4LL0U7 Oh cool, I didn't realize you could opt out without wiping once you were on stable. Thanks! Razed Does this address the 6P battery issues? F4LL0U7 I just got updated to the final 7.1.2 build on my Nexus 5X (N2G47F). Same thing, around 25MB. And then a funny thing happened. I immediately was prompted to download and install the beta 2 (NPG47I). I am ignoring it for now, because I would imagine that installing that will knock me back to the pre-release version of 7.1.2, which I don't want. Anyone else getting this? TBBT+HIMYM The same thing with me. I should try to get out of beta probably. TBBT+HIMYM Yes. It works. F4LL0U7 But you probably had to wipe your phone when exiting the beta, right? TBBT+HIMYM No. Ignore the beta version message. Exit the beta and the message just disappears by itself. Wipe is not necessary. F4LL0U7 Awesome, thanks! danthepotato Opting out once you are on N2G47H solves the problem, without a pesky notification or need to wipe your phone Jacob Mcalister Tattoos I'm still on the beta on pixel xl.. anyone else like this? Anthony Castanza Small Pixel, still on beta, no OTA in sight. el_smurfo How do you have a 6P with the battery so low to update, yet it hasn't long since shut off prematurely at 30-40%? noneofthem Thanks, everybody. I was afraid to be the only one with that issue. I hope Google will find a solution to this fast. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google phone users are always bragging that they're the first to get updates. Now Google has taken it to the next level. Google phone users are the first to get into a continuous, never-ending update loop. Callanish Pure hyperbolic bullshit. There never was a never-ending update loop. All anyone had to do was pay attention to what was going on with the updates and have an incline of knowledge about what it means to be enrolled in the beta program. They'd have seen that the patch was upgrading them to the stable 7.1.2 release. They would have then seen, after rebooting, that there was a glitch with a beta installation trying to get them to install itself over a stable version. Beta 101 enrollment and research would have told them that if they were on a stable version, unenrolling from the beta program would not delete their data and any notification asking them to revert back to a beta version would be gone once unenrolled. That would have eliminated something easily solveable and have avoided giving someone like you a smug 'sky is falling' response making it seem like all this was a big deal. If you're going to be a guinea pig, by running a beta version on a phone, you've got to take some responsibility when things go pear shape and at least use common sense and learn the basics of being part of the beta program beforehand so you can at least recognize when, in this case, the user is causing the loop themselves by continuously downloading whatever the Google Notification is telling them to download and not paying attention to the fact that they are installing a beta version over a stable version creating this self inflicted problem. Charlie I have the same issue. I was confused a bit too. But I think what is going on is the final build date is after the beta 2 build date. So to the system it looks like your not on the latest build. That is why we could not side load the OTA without opting out of beta program because if your on beta 2 it looks like your on the latest build. I don't know why they do that but this is not the first time it has happened. Usually they fix the issue before the OTA is sent out so we don't get the notification for the beta build though. Lucas Cannon 5X as well, received an update stating it would be build N2G47H, then after reboot says build N2G47F. Andre Laurence I just got the final version update. It was a flawless install. FCEEVIPER I installed the OTA NPG47I, then I turned away from my phone and saw the phone was asking for a restartinstall but I did not notice that the restart would be installing NPG471. Maybe I should be paying more attention. : Should I opt out of beta to get the stable build? I'm confused. Erroneus When you have the final version installed (N2G47H), opt out of the beta program. That solves it. KosmoCrisis Me too. Nexus 6p on Project Fi, no different. This type of loop is not fun. onekage Thought it was strange to receive a beta update after receiving the​ final version I had been waiting for, for over a week. Let's hope battery life is a little better... But with a 25mb update I don't have much hope. Hopefully they do something cool with O. BBpost As someone mentioned below, I cleared out the cache for Google Play Services while on N2G47H and rebooted. This fixed the constant update cycle bug. Alvin persaud Install the "h" update first then "I" update (large)when it prompts u back to update to "h" just restart the phone and it should be good to go. Dan Zunko Nexus 5x just got the update. No loop so far. M.R. Betz 5X is up too. N2G47F for my 5X. jdawg0024 Google is also updating the Nexus 5x beta to final as well. I got the update just an hour ago TheDrunkenClam I have tried three times to install this OTA using Flashfire and cannot for the life of me get it to work. Flashfire detects it just fine, but once it fails, I don't know where the OTA resides after it is downloaded so I cannot find where it is to get it to try again (Flashfire doesn't automatically see it on the second attempt after that initial attempt for some reason). So I have been opting out of beta and then back in for it to re download the OTA and thus have Flashfire recognize. 1. Where does the OTA resides after it's downloaded? 2. Any settings in Flashfire that I should look for? idna As far as I can remember, the OTA resides in /data/ota_package (N5X, but it should be the same). And FlashFire can detect it if it's there. But in the past I noticed another location (complicated path, don't remember it now) had been used and indeed, it was not visible for FlashFire - and when I pointed the program to this location it didn't detect anything. What I would recommend is to simply grab the 7.1.2 factory image, opt out of the beta program and simply write this (factory) image with FlashFire, of course without overwriting the userdata partition. That's what I did when the images where released some weeks ago, I couldn't wait for Google to push this special OTA for those of us using the beta program. lomsha The notification finally went away on O. Margaritas Ante Porcos Nexus 6p owners, don't rush to update. My 6p's battery dies within few moments after I've updated from 7.1.1. to 7.1.2. You know how Google reacts to this. Google ignores anything. Morenicano In celebration of fixing the update loop, Google has decided to make another message app F4LL0U7 This one will have a built-in shopping list, but users will only be able to access it via Google Glass. Morenicano ...and the Nexus Q 2 Men-E For some reason my 6P is no longer receiving this final OTA. I downloaded it early today, but did not install it. Since then, I rebooted my 6P, and the install notification went away, and now when I check for updates, nothing is there. AnthonyRyan89 I got the final build update today and updated it then an hour later I got another update for the beta again. Curt Left the beta now. Leeroy Jenkins Feels good to be a pixel user ;) oneyedmonkey Feels good to be a P̶i̶x̶e̶l̶ Nexus user ;) iboalali I got this update got my Nexus 5x yesterday sebastianer This is good. With the 5X after the previous beta, they took more than a month to release the OTA from Beta to Stable. Now only just a week. But from M to N...they released the stable OTA asap, maybe even before the official OTA. and that was even better. Rob Paek I hope this fixes the app crashing I've had lately Keith Boykin I'm stuck on NP47I and it keeps saying it is up to date. Guess I'll have to remove from beta and then re-enroll Marty Wait...Isn't "I" after "H"? Mine shows NPG47I. Why would an "update" be named in a retroactive manner? mrjayviper Goggle with all the feels on its payroll can't solve/perfect OTA updates Wy Elkins Happened on my Nexus 5X yesterday. Finally settled down. Got the April Security update this morning. PP Well... Battery life is better... Less laggy, but cashes more app, now freeze instead of lagging, system UI crashes all the time . Heat problem is not solved. It's not heat as much as my G3 but you see it's taking a great toll on fluidity and stability. If I put it on a ice pack, it's almost instantaneous the gain of speed and fluidity witch lead me to find out that body temperature is bit too hot but room temperature is blazing fast.... I think I found the 801 and 810 heat problem.... They messed up with the temperature target for best operation at the semiconductor plant... It should be body temperature and bit up not room.....

Now the "skinny bundle" is disrupting that model with internet-delivered packages offering live and on-demand programs. Google's YouTube TV is the latest to enter this market with its bundle of around 40 channels for $35 monthly, challenging slim packages from Sony's PlayStation Vue, Dish Network's Sling TV and AT&T's DirecTV Now. More entrants are expected including one from streaming service Hulu. These services offer easy interfaces like those of on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, let viewers digitally store programs in the internet "cloud," and toss in a limited selection of live channels to sate news and sports or other interests. Skinny offerings are aimed at young viewers and "cord cutters" loath to pay $100 or more to be force-fed hundreds of channels in hefty bundles and accustomed to streaming shows they want, when they desire. A Parks Associates survey last month found 20 percent of American consumers dissatisfied with their pay TV service, leaving the market ripe for change. Analyst Glenn Hower at Parks said the market is in flux, with some consumers taking advantage of the easy sign-up for skinny packages, even though some cancel just as quickly. In addition to lower prices, he said, "you don't have to worry about sending out a technician, you don't have to worry about getting the equipment back." BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield, in a research note titled "the big bundle is doomed," says he expects skinny bundles to eat away at the established pay-TV providers. Established media companies are focusing too hard on "protecting their legacy business model" instead of giving consumers the flexibility they want, Greenfield wrote this month. Leichtman Research Group found that the top US cable companies lost 277,000 subscribers in 2016, while internet-delivered services like Sling TV and DirecTV Now added about 845,000. These shifts could lead to a huge upheaval in the television ecosystem, allowing more choices and lower costs for consumers in many cases, while leaving smaller, independent cable channels out in the cold. The skinny bundles "have made inroads in the past year," said Leichtman Research president Bruce Leichtman. - Digital platforms rise - Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said Google's entry into the business is significant because "for the first time, the broadcasters are letting a powerful digital platform have the keys to its treasure room: live, first-run TV shows." He noted that major tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft "have tried to cozy up to TV for many years now, and all of them have been rebuffed" until now. "The digital platforms are indeed taking over the world, this time with permission from their former adversaries," he said in a blog post. While many consumers use on-demand options like Amazon and Netflix, they often keep cable or satellite subscriptions for live sports and local news. But live channels will make streaming options more attractive. At the same time, popular channels such as HBO and sports programmer ESPN have been offering standalone subscriptions to allow consumers to watch without a bundle from cable or satellite. But independent television analyst Alan Wolk argues that the major pay TV firms remain in good shape despite these challenges. Some like AT&T already have a "skinny" offering, and others such as Comcast and Verizon are expected to enter the market to give consumers a choice. Wolk said consumers don't appear to be flocking to skinny bundles because "they pay 30 percent less dollars but get 70 percent less content." He added that "a lot of people think they want to cut back but when you ask them which channels they want to eliminate they have trouble cutting back to the bare minimum." - Striking back - Wolk noted that the large pay TV operators have an advantage because they offer broadband internet, and in some cases are the dominant provider in a region. This allows them to offer incentives which bundle internet and television. The large operators can also squeeze out rivals by using data caps or other means to favor their own streaming service, and will not likely face regulatory impediments from doing so in the current political environment, he said. Operators are also keeping customers with "TV everywhere" which allows subscribers to watch the same content on mobile devices or while traveling, he noted. One impact from the shift to streaming is that providers will know more about customer habits, to be able to deliver advertising targeted to each user. That's positive for marketing, but could be a privacy worry as tech firms build up detailed profiles on consumers. Google in particular can refine its ad model by using data on viewing habits, analysts note. With streaming, Wolk said, Google and others "get a ton of data about users and what they are up to, and they can cross-reference that with your browsing habits."

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

Now the “skinny bundle” is disrupting that model with internet-delivered packages offering live and on-demand programmes. Google’s YouTube TV is the latest to enter this market with its bundle of around 40 channels for US$35 (RM154) monthly, challenging slim packages from Sony’s PlayStation Vue, Dish Network’s Sling TV and AT&T’s DirecTV Now.  More entrants are expected including one from streaming service Hulu. These services offer easy interfaces like those of on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, let viewers digitally store programs in the internet “cloud,” and toss in a limited selection of live channels to sate news and sports or other interests. Skinny offerings are aimed at young viewers and “cord cutters” loath to pay US$100 or more to be force-fed hundreds of channels in hefty bundles and accustomed to streaming shows they want, when they desire. A Parks Associates survey last month found 20 per cent of American consumers dissatisfied with their pay TV service, leaving the market ripe for change. Analyst Glenn Hower at Parks said the market is in flux, with some consumers taking advantage of the easy sign-up for skinny packages, even though some cancel just as quickly. In addition to lower prices, he said, “you don’t have to worry about sending out a technician, you don’t have to worry about getting the equipment back.” BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield, in a research note titled “the big bundle is doomed,” says he expects skinny bundles to eat away at the established pay-TV providers. Established media companies are focusing too hard on “protecting their legacy business model” instead of giving consumers the flexibility they want, Greenfield wrote this month. Leichtman Research Group found that the top US cable companies lost 277,000 subscribers in 2016, while internet-delivered services like Sling TV and DirecTV Now added about 845,000. These shifts could lead to a huge upheaval in the television ecosystem, allowing more choices and lower costs for consumers in many cases, while leaving smaller, independent cable channels out in the cold.  The skinny bundles “have made inroads in the past year,” said Leichtman Research president Bruce Leichtman. Digital platforms rise Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said Google’s entry into the business is significant because “for the first time, the broadcasters are letting a powerful digital platform have the keys to its treasure room: live, first-run TV shows.” He noted that major tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft “have tried to cosy up to TV for many years now, and all of them have been rebuffed” until now. “The digital platforms are indeed taking over the world, this time with permission from their former adversaries,” he said in a blog post. While many consumers use on-demand options like Amazon and Netflix, they often keep cable or satellite subscriptions for live sports and local news. But live channels will make streaming options more attractive. At the same time, popular channels such as HBO and sports programmer ESPN have been offering standalone subscriptions to allow consumers to watch without a bundle from cable or satellite. But independent television analyst Alan Wolk argues that the major pay TV firms remain in good shape despite these challenges. Some like AT&T already have a “skinny” offering, and others such as Comcast and Verizon are expected to enter the market to give consumers a choice. Wolk said consumers don’t appear to be flocking to skinny bundles because “they pay 30 per cent less dollars but get 70 per cent less content.” He added that “a lot of people think they want to cut back but when you ask them which channels they want to eliminate they have trouble cutting back to the bare minimum.” Striking back Wolk noted that the large pay TV operators have an advantage because they offer broadband internet, and in some cases are the dominant provider in a region. This allows them to offer incentives which bundle internet and television. The large operators can also squeeze out rivals by using data caps or other means to favour their own streaming service, and will not likely face regulatory impediments from doing so in the current political environment, he said. Operators are also keeping customers with “TV everywhere” which allows subscribers to watch the same content on mobile devices or while travelling, he noted. One impact from the shift to streaming is that providers will know more about customer habits, to be able to deliver advertising targeted to each user. That’s positive for marketing, but could be a privacy worry as tech firms build up detailed profiles on consumers. Google in particular can refine its ad model by using data on viewing habits, analysts note. With streaming, Wolk said, Google and others “get a ton of data about users and what they are up to, and they can cross-reference that with your browsing habits.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Is 'The Last Jedi' teaser a carbon copy of 'The Force Awakens'?

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV.

While SEO started out as a marketers game, it has become a developer’s game in 2017. With machine learning and algorithms becoming more complex, SEO is definitely more technical in nature than any of us could’ve imagined. As a former web developer of many years, I welcome this change to the more technical realm, but the downside is that it excludes others who are not so tech-oriented. That being said, there are practical things you can do to boost your SEO without becoming a developer: Deliver a Great User Interface (UI) For a long time user interfaces have been given a back seat when it comes to SEO. Since Google’s now famous “Mobile-geddon,” UI is happily riding shotgun in any progressive SEO strategy. Testing your UI is as easy as looking at your mobile site. For example, nobody likes popups that block your site on a mobile device, or any site that is difficult to use. Anything that makes the user experience better helps your Google ranking and boosts your SEO. “I Feel the Need, the Need for Speed” Tom Cruise may have had a “need for speed” in 1986’s Top Gun, but your website needs it even more in 2017. Programs such as Google AMP highlight that the quicker a site loads, the better it will be treated search results. Whether it’s simply making your site run more quickly, or even implementing AMP itself (which can easily be done using a WordPress plugin), there’s no excuse for not pursuing your own need for speed. If you’re no longer using Hubspot or that cool new analytics package, get rid of it. Everything we ask the browser to render leaves users hanging and waiting. The more we ask our users to wait, the less they will. Comprehensive Analytics Understandable and straightforward analytics are key to understanding how your site is performing. Data makes the world go round, so make sure to have analytics on hand to track down site problems, or ways you can be doing things better.   A great way to keep key stakeholders happy is to give them access to the right digestible and easy to use data. There is a marketplace for aesthetically pleasing and highly functional dashboards and other custom reports that are prebuilt and can be easily customizable with a few tweaks. A good analytics program can be like a dog: a person’s best friend but one that doesn’t need to be taken for walk. The main issue I see organizations deal with is analysis paralysis. We have all this data, but what do we do with it? Pick only three or four key metrics and measure the same ones over time, such as time on site, conversions, or overall organic traffic to the site. If you’re looking to keyword optimize a certain page for a certain thing, then monitor the specific page’s organic traffic over time. Social Media Tuning There’s no point in having a website if no one knows where to find it. This is where social media tuning is important. As social platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and others become more vital to people, it is equally important to have a vital social media presence.  Keep your social medial fine-tuned to include regular updates and customer engagement so that your customers not only know you exist, but what you are up to and where to find you as well.   Unless you’re in the cannabis industry, don’t let the grass grow under your feet.  Spread out your social media amongst the platforms, and keep an eye on any new or emerging platform.  This way, if, for example, Facebook makes a change that cramps your style, you don’t want to start from scratch with the next platform and lose revenue in the interim.  Constant tuning is constant innovation.   Be More Secure With the current White House recently signing a law allowing ISP’s to collect and sell your browsing data, internet privacy and security should be at the top of your mind more than ever. What has that got to do with SEO? Well the best offense is a good defense. Google now warns people that sites the they’re visiting are not secure. While Google has not come out and promised to punish site’s search results for not being secure, it’s conceivable that day may be on the horizon. Google doesn’t want to return results that cannot be trusted, and SSL is the easiest way to build that trust. If you don’t use it already, move to using an SSL certificate now to make sure your site is not sitting in the penalty box. All of these strategies and much more can be found in my newly released book The SEO Battlefield: Winning Strategies for Search Marketing Programs, available at Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble and OReilly.com.

People folders in Google Photos are disappearing for some, Google is on the case Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/16 3:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 73 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares164 Applications Bug Watch Google News This holiday weekend might result in some slightly disorganized photos. The automatically created "People" folders in Google Photos are disappearing for some people. At least now you'll have some kind of excuse not to have to show your great-aunt pictures of your kids egg-hunting. It looks like the trouble cropped up sometime in the last few days. Google has already let people that reported the problem on their forum know that it is aware of the issue and is looking for a fix. To see if you've been affected hop on Google Photos and check your "People" album. If you see expected faces missing you're either one of the unlucky ones, or your parents' date at the school dance back in 1955 isn't going too well. In the meantime, if you discover that you are among those experiencing the problem, now you know Google is hot on the case. Should they provide an update on the forums relating to the trouble then we'll be sure to let you know.

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES NEW DELHI: Shares of Just Dial and Info Edge (India) were trading lower in early trade on Monday after Google introduced Areo, one single app for food delivery and home services, currently live in Bangalore and Mumbai on Android devices. Just Dial slipped as much as 3.15 per cent in early trade. The scrip was trading 2.87 per cent down at Rs 507 around 9.30 am (IST). Shares of the company opened at Rs 518 and touched an intraday high and low of Rs 522 and Rs 505, respectively, in the first hour of trade. Info Edge was trading 0.31 per cent down at Rs 838 around the same time. According to UBS, Areo will be in direct competition with Zomato (Info Edge) and Just Dial. Just Dial will be more vulnerable due to delay in promo campaign of its JD app. “Areo is effectively new competition to the JD app,” UBS said. “Areo lets users search for local restaurants and home services like electricians, plumbers and painters, and schedule deliveries or appointments through the app,” the company said in Google Play store. The app also provides customer reviews of the available companies, eateries to help one make informed choices on product quality and timeliness of service. The app has pay by card, net banking or cash on delivery services. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, Info Edge (India) reported a net profit of Rs 47.12 crore, up 76 per cent, against Rs 26.76 crore reported for the corresponding quarter last year. Just Dial posted 5.90 per cent year-on-year rise in net profit at Rs 27.44 crore during the quarter under review.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. By Lucian Constantin Romania Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 11, 2017 8:58 AM PT Credit: Peter Sayer More like this To punish Symantec, Google may distrust a third of the web's SSL certificates After Digital Certificate Hack, Mozilla Seeks Reassurances HTTPS Is Under Attack Again Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key In a few months, publicly trusted certificate authorities will have to start honoring a special Domain Name System (DNS) record that allows domain owners to specify who is allowed to issue SSL certificates for their domains. The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record became a standard in 2013 but didn't have much of a real-world impact because certificate authorities (CAs) were under no obligation to conform to them. The record allows a domain owner to list the CAs that are allowed to issue SSL/TLS certificates for that domain. The reason for this is to limit cases of unauthorized certificate issuance, which can be accidental or intentional, if a CA is compromised or has a rogue employee. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] Under existing industry rules created by the CA/Browser Forum, an organization that combines major browser vendors and CAs, certificate authorities must validate that requests for SSL certificates originate from domain owners themselves or from someone in control of those domains. This ownership verification is typically automated and involves asking the domain owner to create a DNS TXT record with a specific value or to upload authorization codes at a specific location in their site's structure, thus proving their control over the domain. However, hacking into a website could also give an attacker the ability to pass such verifications and request a valid certificate for the compromised domain from any certificate authority. Such a certificate could later be used to launch man-in-the-middle attacks against users or to direct them to phishing pages. The goal behind the CAA record is to limit who can issue certificates for a domain. For example, Google's CAA record is: google.com 86400 IN CAA 0 issue "symantec.com." This means that Google specifically authorizes Symantec to issue certificates for its main domain name. In March, the CA/B Forum voted to make CAA record checking mandatory as part of the certificate issuing process. This requirement will go into effect on Sept. 8, and CAs that will fail to honor these records will be in violation of industry rules and will risk sanctions. In addition to the "issue" tag, the CAA record also supports a tag called "iodef" that will also be mandatory for CAs to comply with. This tag allows the domain owner to specify an email address or a URL where CAs can report certificate issuing requests that conflict with the domain's CAA policy. For example, if one CA receives a request for a certificate for domain X, but domain X has a CAA record that authorizes a different CA to issue certificates, the first CAmust report the suspicious request to the email address or the URL specified in the CAA iodef property. This will alert the domain owner that someone else might be trying to obtain a certificate without authorization. "CAA is not a silver bullet, but it is another layer in our defense," Scott Helme, a security researcher and HTTPS deployment expert, said in a blog post. "We don't have to worry about vendor lock because the record is only checked at the point of issuance, and it couldn't be simpler to setup. There's really nothing to lose."

People folders in Google Photos are disappearing for some, Google is on the case Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/16 3:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 73 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares164 Applications Bug Watch Google News This holiday weekend might result in some slightly disorganized photos. The automatically created "People" folders in Google Photos are disappearing for some people. At least now you'll have some kind of excuse not to have to show your great-aunt pictures of your kids egg-hunting. It looks like the trouble cropped up sometime in the last few days. Google has already let people that reported the problem on their forum know that it is aware of the issue and is looking for a fix. To see if you've been affected hop on Google Photos and check your "People" album. If you see expected faces missing you're either one of the unlucky ones, or your parents' date at the school dance back in 1955 isn't going too well. In the meantime, if you discover that you are among those experiencing the problem, now you know Google is hot on the case. Should they provide an update on the forums relating to the trouble then we'll be sure to let you know.

Posted on April 17, 2017, 00:00 GMT Nitasha Tiku BuzzFeed News Reporter Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On vk Share On vk Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Share On lineapp Share On lineapp Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Share On email Share On email Share On sms Share On sms Share On whatsapp Share On whatsapp Share On more Share On more Share On more Share On more More Share On tumblr Share On tumblr Share On stumbleupon Share On stumbleupon Share On linkedin Share On linkedin Share On reddit Share On reddit Share On googleplus Share On googleplus Share On link Share On link Until recently, Mark Zuckerberg’s most iconic public appearance may have been the image of the young startup founder sweating through his hoodie onstage while journalist Kara Swisher grilled him at a tech conference in 2010. But Zuckerberg’s reputation as someone averse to the hot seat began a couple years earlier, on 60 Minutes. In the segment, anchor Lesley Stahl tells a 23-year-old Zuckerberg he’s replaced Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin as the tech exec that “everyone is talking about.” In response, the CEO of Facebook says nothing, his face placid. “You’re just staring at me,” says Stahl. “Is that a question?” Zuckerberg shoots back. Cue the voiceover: “We were warned that he can be awkward and reluctant to talk about himself.” Zuckerberg, now a 32-year-old dad with one daughter and another on the way, has evolved considerably in the intervening decade. He hired speechwriters. He spruced up his uniform from Valley schlub to monochrome minimalism. He took on a series of annual self-improvement challenges that made him into a “lifestyle guru” for some male tech workers, according to the New York Times Style section. (The paper said his announcements “sometimes have the feel of software upgrades,” but disciples admire Zuckerberg’s ability to reinvent himself “as a better human being.”) “One of the things I’ve noticed over the years, he has improved his EQ,” Swisher told BuzzFeed News. (EQ is shorthand for emotional quotient, a popular rubric for measuring interpersonal skills in Silicon Valley.) “He was super, super awkward to talk to and he knew that he had a problem and he was fully aware. He cared about changing it.” He may even have challenged himself to improve. “I’m really shy, I should learn not to be so shy! I can see him saying that,” Swisher said. Now, Zuckerberg is even leading the charge for Silicon Valley tech CEOs who, post-election, have committed to leaving their bubble and interacting with the American public. He’s actively inserting himself into unfamiliar situations. This time around, however, Zuckerberg has cut out the media middleman. He’s communicating with people through his own platform, where he has amassed 88 million Facebook followers. And he’s not just talking to them about Facebook — he’s talking to them about himself. The most obvious example of the new and improved Zuckerberg is his 2017 personal challenge: to travel to all 50 states and talk to “folks” about their lives and concerns for the future. Four months in, he is making good time on his vow. He’s already visited an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, sampled BBQ in Baton Rouge, and petted a baby longhorn ("so cute") at a rodeo in Ft. Worth. Oftentimes the themes of these visits coincide with those in the 6,000-word letter that he posted in February arguing in favor of building a global community (and Facebook’s role as the “social infrastructure” underpinning all of it). After every trip, Zuckerberg posts earnest dispatches on his Facebook page, including images taken by the former Obama photographer who now accompanies Zuckerberg on his travels. A communications staffer also comes along to gather details, like the names and quotes that pepper the humanizing anecdotes that make up his posts. The whole thing makes for what one former Obama aide told BuzzFeed News is “definitely an Obama-esque approach.” (Jon Lovett, a former speechwriter for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, went with a slightly different comparison onstage at South by Southwest last month: “I don’t understand why he sounds like a senator in his fourth term. Like, just talk, man! Don’t be so afraid.”) View this post on Facebook facebook.com It is indeed tempting to see Zuckerberg’s listening tour, manifesto, and newly folksy demeanor as an attempt to beta-test a presidential bid — perhaps for 2020, the same year he turns 35. After all, Facebook’s platform has been known to launch a political career or two. Denials from Zuckerberg — including telling BuzzFeed News in January that he had no plans to run for president — have been laughed off. “I don’t understand why he sounds like a senator in his fourth term. Like, just talk, man! Don’t be so afraid.” Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Facebook declined repeated requests to interview Zuckerberg on this topic (no surprise given the company’s zero-tolerance policy on acknowledging its own self-interest). But the CEO of a $400 billion company doesn’t schedule 30 action-packed trips in one year, with a small content production staff in tow, just to lend folks an ear. Facebook is a leviathan and, as its leader, Zuckerberg has plenty of reasons to benefit from a whistlestop tour without ever running for office. If you think of Zuckerberg as a startup CEO, positioning himself like a fourth-term senator doesn't make sense — but it does if you think of him as the head of a 14-year-old nation-state called Facebook. At a time when Silicon Valley’s influence rivals Washington, DC's, Zuckerberg is using the framework of a political campaign (and its mix of the personal and the professional) to build a playbook for the modern-day CEO-statesman. “Every single wealthy business person or billionaire has got to be watching Trump and thinking, 'I can do that and I have a lot of good ideas,'” said Swisher. “I’m not sure [Zuckerberg] knows what he’s doing yet. He’s very very well meaning, at least compared to most people. He wants to find out if there’s some way to fix the damn thing.” In classic Facebook fashion, however, Zuckerberg has launched this political campaign without really taking a political position. (How else did he become the new poster CEO for civic engagement without ever disclosing who he voted for?) Where candidates want to win over citizens to push through policies and ideologies, CEOs need soft power to smooth the way for their ideas and products. The listening tour and manifesto are an opportunity for Zuckerberg to strengthen his relationship with his 1.8 billion constituents. “He wants to build social capital and he knows he can’t do that if he has the nerdy-guy track record,” a former Facebook executive told BuzzFeed News. A guiding phrase inside Facebook is “preserving optionality” — Stanford-speak for keeping your alternatives open. The same philosophy drove Facebook to place bets on every promising new technology platform from virtual reality to artificial intelligence: Zuckerberg has turned setting himself up to succeed into a science. And now, with the relatively recent formation of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative — the philanthropy-focused LLC to which he and his wife have pledged to donate 99% of their Facebook shares, worth an estimated $45 billion — he is at the apex of his influence, with few signs of stopping. Zuckerberg has every reason to win your likes, and he’s built a remarkable apparatus to do it. View this post on Facebook Mark Zuckerberg / Facebook / Via facebook.com Zuckerberg’s sprint across the United States comes at a portentous moment for tech, and for Facebook. Katie Jacobs Stanton, a former Twitter executive who also worked as director of citizen participation under Obama, told BuzzFeed News that after years of measuring success on growth rates, monthly active users, and the efficiency of hiring fewer employees, the industry is looking around and wondering how it got here. “It’s Silicon Valley growing up. After 10 to 15 years of thinking we were making the world a better place, [the events of the past year] have brought about some soul searching. We're in our adolescence stage — optimistic, naive, and perhaps a bit awkward,” she said. At Facebook in particular, “everyone at that company is stinging from the post-election fallout,” said the former Obama aide. “Not just sensationalism or hyper-partisanship, but mainstreaming the alt-right and right-wing populist resurgence.” Right now, Zuckerberg needs public goodwill to protect the idea that his product is a tool for connectivity and not misinformation, mass surveillance, or censorship. Add to that Facebook’s stranglehold on the media and the $18 billion online advertising market, and suddenly the term “antitrust regulation” sounds like more than just a quaint European custom. Lately, even the word “platform,” which once made it easy for tech companies to evade accountability, is starting to sound sinister. The New York Times recently argued that companies like Facebook, Google, and Uber are largely responsible for “rehabilitating the concept” of a monopoly in their endless drive to dominate. At the same time, Silicon Valley’s pseudo-statesmen are coming to occupy an odd place in the cultural firmament as quasi-celebrities and sherpas to our uncertain future. “Never before have we had a time when we are so viscerally connected to company leaders,” Brooke Hammerling, a high-profile public relations executive and the founder of Brew PR, told BuzzFeed News. “My parents were never like, ‘I love the founders of my refrigerator company!’” In this case, “people who have never met Mark Zuckerberg call him Zuck. They spend their lives in these platforms and apps. That’s why it’s so important for the success of that company. He’s their public face.” Margit Wennmachers, a PR guru and partner at Andreessen Horowitz, which is also an investor in BuzzFeed, said that Zuckerberg has to deal with an added layer of complexity because he’s synonymous with Facebook. “You end up being very associated with all the features and all the bugs,” she said. Thanks in part to Zuckerberg’s own creation, anyone with an online following can be a self-styled pundit. But unlike, say, a B-list actor tweeting about geopolitics, people actually want tech moguls to weigh in. Virtue signaling has become as much of a duty for a modern-day Silicon Valley CEO as writing a mission statement or releasing diversity numbers (even if the virtue is superficial and the diversity numbers are low). That personal connection with chief executives of consumer-facing companies comes with higher expectations. Perhaps to preempt social media scrutiny, tech CEOs and venture capitalists have been eager to volunteer themselves as socially conscious tribute over the past few months, treating Trump’s presidency as a second chance to make a good impression. Zuckerberg’s contemporaries are already copying his moves: “Many of us leaders have been inspired to speak up more recently,” Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told Forbes India during a recent trip to the subcontinent. “We preside over a huge community of people, and policies and the way people live together have an impact. When we design our community, we think like politicians legislating for their constituents.” Last month, John Zimmer, the CEO of Lyft, made the dynamic sound even more intimate, describing his ride-hailing software application as a “better boyfriend” to consumers. “We’re woke,” said Zimmer, whose company is financed by the venture capital fund founded by top Trump adviser Peter Thiel (who also happens to be a Facebook board member). So before headlines accuse Zuckerberg of finally asphyxiating the media industry or dictating what your kid gets to learn in school (CZI’s personalized learning software is already being used by 20,000 students), why not bank some family-friendly pics of him posing with a shrimp boat captain or walking around the campus of a historically black college? Billionaires and tech titans “who successfully influence politics and policy have a public persona of being relatable and not seeming like they’re soulless,” the former Obama aide explained. It can only help Zuckerberg’s cause if he “doesn’t just seem like some automaton when he’s trying to lobby Congress, but has a family and beliefs.” And as any modern influencer knows, there’s no better lobbyist for Mark Zuckerberg’s personal brand than those closest to him: his brilliant, compassionate wife Priscilla, his adorable daughter Max, and their mop of a dog, Beast. Much like a lifestyle blogger, Zuckerberg uses his Palo Alto home as the backdrop for his posts as often as his instantly recognizable glass-walled conference room at Facebook’s headquarters, referred to internally as the Aquarium. “People trust people more when they get a sense of them as human beings,” said Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and a longtime friend and mentor of Zuckerberg’s. It’s a new twist on the old saying: If the CEO is not ​(overtly) ​selling the product, he is the product. Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Even his philanthropist buddy Bill Gates is participating in the performative fun. Zuckerberg recently posted a Saturday Night Live–style promo of himself and Gates in which Zuck aims to build up hype for his upcoming Harvard commencement speech. (“They know we didn’t actually graduate, right?” Zuckerberg quips, billionaire to billionaire, to lighten the mood.) When this strategy is at its best, Zuckerberg conflates the personal and the professional seamlessly. It’s a new twist on the old saying: If the CEO is not ​(overtly) ​selling the product, he is the product. At Facebook’s F8 developer conference in April 2016, Zuckerberg used his own life as a way to explain the importance of 360-degree video. “When I was a baby and I took my first steps, my parents wrote the date in a baby book,” he said. “And when my daughter Max takes her first steps hopefully later this year, I want to capture the whole scene with a 360 video.” Eight months later, in December, Zuckerberg posted a 360 video that he had teased of Max walking. “We’re connected to him on an emotional level,” said Hammerling of the video, adding of course that it “showcased the technology in such a beautiful way.” View this post on Facebook Facebook: video.php It may be hard to remember this now, but Zuckerberg used to be a pretty private guy. The world didn’t know what his living room looked like, how many pull-ups he could do, or even what brand of gray T-shirt he wore. (The smart money’s on this $300 number from Italy.) When Hoffman first met Zuckerberg more than a decade ago, the young startup founder was uncertain about putting himself out there. Zuckerberg wondered, “How much of my personal life should I share? Is it a useful thing for the kind of things I’m trying to do in the world?” Hoffman told BuzzFeed News. The chief executive was so camera-shy that one candid photo of the Zuckerberg clan — taken by his sister Randi, who didn’t understand Facebook’s privacy settings — prompted a ripple of schadenfreude across the blogosphere in 2012 when it was shared publicly. Back then, Hoffman recalled, critics thought Zuckerberg was an “on-the-spectrum tech genius trying to kind of rule the world.” It didn’t help that for several months in 2010, Jesse Eisenberg’s sullen mug was staring into the middle distance on movie posters across America to hype Aaron Sorkin’s The Social Network, the unauthorized biopic that introduced Zuckerberg to much of the world as a prickly lout. And early attempts to schedule positive PR to offset public embarrassments didn’t play out well — like Zuckerberg’s exhaustively orchestrated appearance on Oprah to announce a $100 million donation to the Newark schools, which not-so-coincidentally aired a week before the movie’s premiere. But around the time that Zuckerberg and Chan were expecting their first child, things began to change. Many sources pointed to his announcement about their first daughter Max as a turning point in their impression of Zuckerberg. In the post, Zuckerberg discussed the trouble they had conceiving, a private struggle many couples are too ashamed to discuss publicly. (The post got more than 1.7 million likes and was shared more than 50,000 times.) According to a source familiar with Facebook’s strategy, Zuckerberg’s more concerted embrace of social media came after that, in late 2015. When it began, the company had a few priorities in mind: to be perceived as a world-class tech company and not just a social media app, to demonstrate that Facebook is concerned about people, and to make Zuckerberg more likable. That timeline lines up with a report in The Information that Facebook began closely tracking a metric called “Cares About Users,” or CAU (pronounced “cow” inside the company) in the winter of 2014. Two other carefully monitored metrics look at whether Facebook seems innovative and whether Facebook seems like a force for good. But the best example of this shift toward social media psy-ops might be a series of slick videos about Jarvis, the digital butler that Zuckerberg coded from scratch for his 2016 personal challenge. The mini movie trailers touch on all those notes (likable, caring, innovative, good for humanity), but in a more subtle way than those overly cheery greetings that Facebook started serving at the top of your feed. In the spots, Jarvis, voiced by Morgan Freeman, helps Zuckerberg make toast, let his parents in the front door, and teach his daughter Mandarin. The videos are selling a sentiment: Artificial intelligence is useful, personal, and safe to use at home. Mark Zuckerberg is an approachable, nerdy family man and kooky inventor. When you think of AI, think of Facebook. Shortly after the ad’s debut, Facebook posted a job listing for a video producer whose duties included helping Facebook’s CEO. And it’s not incidental that many of the people contacted by BuzzFeed News seemed allergic to acknowledging that Zuckerberg’s transformation may have required help (or in some cases even that it took place). They will tell you, unprompted, that Mark is an incredible learner and an unparalleled listener. But ask what he learned from or who he listened to and they’ll tell you you’re missing the point. The point, you see, is that he learns and listens. People close to Zuckerberg are so deeply invested in Zuckerberg’s appearance of authenticity that you can practically hear them erasing themselves from the picture. View this post on Facebook Facebook: video.php Which brings us to the listening tour and the manifesto. In both cases, Facebook seems to be capitalizing on something that Zuckerberg began organically. The manifesto started with the CEO himself, writing it on nights and weekends. (No comms team is going to ask for a 6,000-word treatise.) Then Facebook, a company obsessed with scale and infrastructure, seems to have grafted a promotional strategy on top of it. Zuckerberg has always argued that a for-profit company is the best way to do good in the world. And throughout both these efforts, the solution Zuckerberg suggests is often more Facebook, further centralizing his power. In fact, the listening tour is looking less like a presidential gambit and more like a focus group. Zuckerberg is not talking to military spouses about the defense budget or veterans affairs. He’s not talking to Mother Emanuel church congregants about domestic terrorists and hate crimes. He’s talking to them about the importance of community and, by extension, about Facebook. After lunch with military spouses in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he noted that they use “a combination of Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Skype” to stay connected with deployed family members. (Zuckerberg’s corporation owns three of the four technologies he named.) Zuckerberg's listening tour is less a presidential gambit than a focus group with Facebook users. Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share There are easier ways to appear woke than traveling across the country to talk about Facebook’s weak spots. By the same token, the 6,000-word manifesto shows Zuckerberg beginning to grapple with Facebook’s responsibility. But the letter was also widely interpreted as a public stand against nativism. (The New York Times said it “comes close to a political statement.") When boiled down, however, it read more like a product road map. Each section starts at 20,000 feet, but dwindles down to an upcoming Facebook feature — a feature that, if launched, will now get swept up into Zuckerberg’s “globalization” crusade, instead of an aging platform’s attempt to drive user engagement. Perhaps purposefully, Zuckerberg overshot his mark: Facebook users were asking him to fix fake news, and he responded with plans to fix global society. The social network’s top brass has used this antiseptic approach before, during the campaign around Lean In, the self-help book for working women written by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who is fending off her own rumors about running for president. Both Lean In and the listening tour appear to engage with a controversial issue, while glossing over Facebook’s role (in the lack of diversity in tech and the lack of diversity of news information, respectively). Sandberg supported feminism the way Zuckerberg supports globalization: from so high in the clouds you can barely see if anything’s changing on the ground. “They’re very careful, very studious, they don’t wanna rock the boat, like when they met with conservatives,” Swisher said. “Some people might say, ‘Oh, just tell them to shut up!’ But they couldn’t do that when, you know, all of them are Democrats and all of them are very liberal.” “At the same time, you’re this rich and this famous, you might want to stand for something.” Maciej Cegłowski, a tech CEO and critic who has been hosting Tech Solidarity meetups with industry employees around the country, said this approach is disingenuous considering all the data Facebook is sitting on, like information about micro-targeted campaigns that were run during the election to suppress African-American voters. “There’s so much duplicity in how he writes about connecting the world,” said Cegłowski. “He has a really rich trove of data on people and he’s still arguing from general principles about what is community.” Facebook vice president Elliot Schrage, who, along with Sandberg, is one of Zuckerberg’s advisers, laid out the strategy behind this in emails about the Oprah appearance that were obtained through public record requests. “Employ language that resonates well with a mass audience, without alienating potential adversaries,” he wrote in 2010. “Our goal is to better explain objectives and avoid hot-button words if we can.” When you’re trying to appease American conservatives and Chinese officials at the same time, it’s safer to throw out anodyne terms. “Advancing human potential” is less likely to raise hackles than “advancing charter schools,” a cause that Zuckerberg has supported in the past, just as “globalization” is safer than “democracy” or “free trade” and “sensationalism” has more gravitas than “fake news.” The CEO of Facebook doesn’t need to run for office to benefit from the public perception that he’s a thoughtful, politically engaged innovator building the scaffolding for the future of the global community.

If anything, Zuckerberg’s political agenda has been hiding in plain sight. He wants to win over the world to help his philanthropic interests. In an email to Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta that was later published by WikiLeaks, Sandberg — who was expected to serve as Hillary Clinton’s treasury secretary if the election went a different way — implored Podesta to advise Zuckerberg on the best way to build “effective political operations” in order to advance public policy goals in areas like “immigration, education or basic scientific research.” Zuckerberg’s first foray into politics was an immigration advocacy super PAC called FWD.us, which he mentioned in a recent Facebook post about Trump’s immigration order; CZI’s top priorities are changing policy in education and science. In January, the initiative announced that it hired former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe as “political muscle” for its advocacy goals. (Ken Mehlman, who managed George W. Bush’s re-election campaign, will sit on CZI’s advisory board.) In an interview with the New York Times, Zuckerberg argued that bipartisan political operatives were necessary for CZI to do its good work: “You can make change, but in order for it to be sustainable, you need to build a movement to support it.” A job application for CZI’s director of advocacy says candidates must be as comfortable in a room full of engineers as they are “in the basement of a church rallying people to organize on behalf of criminal justice reform." Zuckerberg is far from the first capitalist to switch gears from showing no mercy in the public markets to launching a massive foundation. “Some people choose to focus on building their business before turning to philanthropy in a big way,” Microsoft founder Bill Gates wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. “But it’s exciting and inspiring to see younger people like Mark and Priscilla realize that they can do both — they can make an incredible impact on the world through philanthropy and Mark can continue to build and lead Facebook to new heights.” That desire to “do both” helps explain why Zuckerberg might need the brownie points. Uber’s downward spiral over the past few months is ample evidence of how much a company’s bottom line can rest on the public’s impression of its CEO. Likability is an asset when it comes to backlash from Facebook’s disillusioned workforce, populist backlash against Silicon Valley, even faith in the free market itself. (After the launch of CZI, The New Yorker wrote that charitable giving on this scale makes the inequalities of modern capitalism “seem somewhat more defensible.” Tech columnist David Pogue shared a similar sentiment, except a decade earlier, declaring that he could no longer consider the founder of Microsoft a ruthless monopolist after he donated 95% of his fortune: “Mr. Gates’s entire life arc suddenly looks like a 35-year game of Robin Hood.” In interviews with BuzzFeed News, Zuckerberg’s mentors — including Hoffman, SV Angel founder Ron Conway, and early Facebook employee Matt Cohler, who is now a partner at Benchmark Capital — all argued that Zuckerberg’s recent likability blitz is genuine, part of a continuous evolution brought on by increased maturity, acceptance of responsibility, and becoming a dad. As Hoffman — who recently announced a $20 million donation to CZI’s Biohub — said, if in 2010 Zuckerberg’s public perception was as a hoodie-wearing creep with poor social skills, now there’s a realization that “in addition to a super smart, super capable guy, he is also is a loving father, he has kind of a personal voice, he has emotional vibrancy.” “Do I think it’s calculated? Absolutely, but that doesn’t mean calculated in a bad way.” Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share “Do I think it’s calculated?” Hammerling asked. “Absolutely, but that doesn’t mean calculated in a bad way. He’s testing his comfort level.” Hoffman stressed that the newfound personal transparency isn’t a PR ploy. “It’s substantive. It’s not like marketing, brand image, ‘Oh, I’m gonna do the cute dog pictures because everybody likes cute dog pictures and letters to children.’” In his view, Zuckerberg is “working aggressively to have a bunch of power in order to move the world the right way” and is earnestly committed to his mission. It may look like he’s power hungry, but Zuckerberg simply trusts himself, and with good reason. Historically, a former executive said, Zuckerberg's "long-term decision-making worked out better than instincts of other people who may have influenced him, like Wall Street.” When Facebook first launched, it had a tagline across the bottom of the page that said “a Mark Zuckerberg production”; perhaps that’s still the case. The same former Facebook executive described Zuckerberg as a genuinely curious person who wants to understand the world. Like many other Americans, elites or otherwise, Zuckerberg is trying to get out of his filter bubble. “People can make fun of him going around the country and visiting diners, but they’re all sitting in their little homes trying to one up each other,” said Swisher, “At least someone is trying, even if it seems like French King visiting the countryside.” Nitasha Tiku is a senior writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco.

Her body was found half a mile away from her home. This week, CNN reports that police have arrested the man they believe killed her. Screenshot/CBS Boston On Saturday, Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. announced in a press conference: “We got him. We're very confident that we got Vanessa Marcotte's killer.” Loading Facebook Video... CBS Boston reports that Angelo Colon-Ortiz, 31, was arrested on Saturday morning for assault and battery with intent to rape. Early anticipates that a murder charge will be added this week. On August 7, 2016, police officers were called when family members were unable to find Marcotte. Her body was located on the side of a two-lane road by a Massachusetts State Police K9 unit at 8:30 p.m. She was naked and had burns on her head, hands, and feet. Police believe Marcotte put up a fight before she died. Experts at the Massachusetts crime lab were able to remove DNA from her hands. After Marcotte was found, the Washington Post reports, police officers recorded more than 1,300 tips from the public. Several witnesses reported seeing a dark SUV parked on the side of the road at the time of the incident.

In February, Boston Globe reports, the DNA evidence from her hands returned more details about the suspect. They knew they were looking for a man with Hispanic or Latino features. #VanessaMarcotte person of interest described as Hispanic or Latino man w/athletic build, short hair/shaved head, about 30 years old #wcvb— Erika Tarantal (@ErikaWCVB) February 23, 2017 Investigators got a lucky break when Trooper Robert Parr spotted a man who matched the description of the suspect driving a dark SUV. Parr wrote down the license plate on his hand and later tracked down his address. When the police went to investigate the suspect, they discovered that Colon-Ortiz speaks limited English. They had to use an interpreter to question him. During the press conference, Early said the department cannot comment on the status of his citizenship at this time. @JadedByPolitics 31-year-old Angelo Colon-Ortiz "speaks some English," according to DA. Used interpreter during questioning.— Stephe96 (@Stephe96) April 15, 2017 Upon request, Colon-Ortiz provided a buccal swab to police. It matched the DNA sample that had been scraped from Marcotte's hands. Early said as soon as the DNA was a confirmed match, they arrested Colon-Ortiz: “It’s through her determined fight and her efforts that we obtained the DNA of her killer.” He also added that Marcotte's family and friends have been helpful throughout the investigation. They were contacted early in the morning on Saturday about the arrest. Later that evening, they released a statement: “After eight long months, we're able to take the first step toward justice for Vanessa. She was a beautiful, intelligent, and generous young woman whose passion for giving back to the community will always be remembered. As we move forward, her spirit will live on through The Vanessa T. Marcotte Foundation that strives to empower women to live boldly and fearlessly.” ICYMI: Best friend to run @bostonmarathon in memory of Princeton jogger, Vanessa Marcotte.Her very inspiring story. https://t.co/j6RyRPUwHe— Katelyn Flint (@KFlintNBCBoston) April 12, 2017 Authorities will continue their investigation this week. Early said they never once gave up on their search to find Marcotte's killer. Colon-Ortiz is currently being held on a $10 million bail and he's scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday.             View Comments(0 comments) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via email                     Join/LoginSearchDiscuss About usCareersAdvertiseContactPrivacy©Copyright 2017 all rights reserved
Now Boarding - By Les Shu   Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Need to get away? 5 ways to book a much-needed… Need to get away? 5 ways to book a much-needed, impromptu vacay By Les Shu — April 16, 2017 1:00 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Summer is approaching, and that means we have wanderlust in our minds. Many will have already planned in advanced, but if you’re like this writer, you’ll leave it to the last minute. Congratulations, you are a “spontaneous traveler,” a term that’s being kicked around in the travel industry to describe a trend in post-Boomer generations. This shift mirrors how we travel plan today. We no longer drive to the travel agency, but pull up a travel site to book our flights and hotels. But even that’s becoming old school: A lot more of us are now using apps on our phones. And with a desire for on-demand pricing and booking, there are plenty of travel apps that do just that. But what if you are looking for inspiration? While most apps are good at handle the basic transactions, few can offer insights or recommendations. If you’re looking for some help in planning a last-minute getaway, these six apps are our current favorites. Google Flights Google Flights is useful for looking up real-time airfare and price fluctuations, but if you’re looking for inspiration, the website (there’s no app) has a handy discovery tool. Punch in some dates or search by month, length of trip, places, and interests. You can leave it vague if you want a wide selection of suggestions, or narrow down to a specific weekend or location. The website shows a visual list of recommended cities, along with estimated pricing for flights (based on your point of departure) and hotels, as well as interests (we’re not sure we would count “fog” as our must-see attraction in San Francisco, but to each his own). If you have a strict budget, use the “Explore map” view to adjust the search parameters to include a price cap. Then, pan through the map to see what surprising locations pop up. Hit the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button if you really want to be spontaneous. Hopper We’ve sung many praises for Hopper, the flight search app that uses artificial intelligence and big data to make fare predictions. It tells you the best times to book, and you can have Hopper keep watch for better prices. Hopper’s results can help you determine whether you should make that last-minute getaway or save it for another time. A new feature we like is Fair Bear. Essentially, it’s an overview of the fine print associated with an airfare that many travelers may not pay attention to. While a fare may be the cheapest, it could come with a lot of restrictions. As airlines continue to introduce confusing pricing tiers and new fees, Fair Bear gives a quick nutshell of what you’re getting into, and whether the price is worth it. HotelTonight With the rise in what’s being termed “spontaneous travel,” many hotel booking services are now catering to last-minute travelers. The one app that’s the most popular is HotelTonight, which focuses solely on this type of travel. HotelTonight says it offers heavily discounted rates, and we found this to be accurate. In one search, a HotelTonight rate for one hotel was $100 (or more) cheaper than other booking sites, include the hotel’s. The only downside we notice is that hotels tend to be on the pricier side, but the positive is that they are all highly rated properties, so you don’t have to scroll through hundreds of listings. Airbnb While it’s better known as the app for short-term vacation rentals, Airbnb also offers a service called Experiences. As the name suggests, these are events hosted by in-the-know locals that focus on interests in the area, like sake tasting in Tokyo, home cooking in Bangkok, trail exploration in Portland, Oregon. If you’re looking to include some authentic experiences – whether it’s the arts, food, nature, etc. – in your trip, this is a nicer alternative to packaged tours. Of course, you can still use the app to book last-minute lodging. Google Trips Not to be confused with Google Flights, Google Trips is an iOS and Android app for planning and managing itineraries. It’s great for those who already have a flight reserved (if you use Gmail for bookings, it can search for trips – past and future – and automatically add them to the list), but haven’t done any research on things to do and see, places to eat, important info to know, how to get around, etc. – city guides essentially. Besides suggestions, Google Trips can even plan entire itineraries for select destinations, which is perfect for the lazy, last minute non-planner.

Microsoft’s Next Surface Book Will Be Education Focused That Runs Windows 10 Cloud: Poised To Take On Google’s ChromeBook N. GutierrezApr 16, 2017 02:19 AM EDT Facebook Linkedin Twitter Google+ Print Email (Photo : Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Microsoft's rumored new Surface device is reported to run on Windows 10 Cloud and would sport an ARM-processor. Microsoft was seen to be out powered by Google in terms of education laptop systems in the previous years. Yet, this time the company aims to create a new Microsoft Surface Book that would target education along with the rumored integration of Windows 10 Cloud. According to Digital Trends, Microsoft is planning to release an education focused Microsoft  Surface Book, especially for students. As people know Chromebook takes the lead in the category, but Microsoft was reported to take on the prime with full force and releases its rumored Windows 10 Cloud.

Windows 10 Cloud was then explained to be a system that would only allow Universal Windows Platform apps, Win32 programs, and other apps to be downloaded from the Windows store. Hence, the expected new Microsoft Surface Book was considered by some to be the perfect alternative for Chrome OS. Liliputing mentioned that as Google Chromebooks were said to be favored by students due to its security patches, the new Microsoft Surface Book which would be Cloud-based could be a formidable competitor as well. The Windows 10 Cloud system would indeed aid administrators’ total control over their student’s laptops as reported. IDC PC sales tracker, Jay Chou also added that “The saving grace for Microsoft right now is that Chromebooks are having trouble at anything outside English-speaking markets right now.” “They have good traction in the U.S. and Canada, and nothing much more beyond that,” further adding another advantage of a possible new Microsoft Surface Book over Chromebooks. Some rumors were leaked about the new Microsoft Surface Book education-focused device as well. The device was speculated to run an ARM-based processor that would lessen the cost and provide a long lasting battery. But some expect it to sports Intel’s Kaby Lake chips. Another rumor is that the device will not carry the Surface name but a ‘Cloudbook’ series instead similar to the Surface, Nexus, and Pixel series. Meanwhile, other rumors regarding Microsoft’s May 2 event aside from the new Microsoft Surface Book was shared by PC World. It was mentioned that a Surface Pro running on Intel Kaby Lake chipset is expected by tech enthusiasts. Windows 10 replacing Windows mobile was also rumored to become possible as well. Lastly, it was speculated that Microsoft might be unveiling its Cortana-powered devices along with improved features that failed during the Windows 10 Creators Update. Microsoft’s May 2 #MicrosoftEDU event in New York City was speculated to be the launch date for the new Microsoft Surface Book Windows 10 Cloud education based device. Nonetheless, any details or hints about the device weren't given by the Washington-based company.

It encourages innovation and investment, attracts creative people, and generates a certain energy– making the entire city a more desirable place to live. Additionally, when local startups are acquired by big companies, and those companies hire more people in the area, the result is more jobs, which boosts the local economy in a lot of new ways. A great example of how big companies get here is Sketchup, a startup that my partner Mark Solon invested in back when it was a tiny company. Google acquired Sketchup in 2006, and we’ve had the footprint of Google’s presence in Boulder ever since then. Bolstered by the addition of around 1,500 jobs in Boulder, over the years that acquisition has significantly contributed to Boulder’s growth and housing boom. Similarly, in 2011 Federated Media purchased Lijit (now Sovrn), leading to an increase in hiring at the Boulder office. And in 2014, Boulder startup Gnip was acquired by Twitter, leading to their large office here. By the way, even as I write this, Twitter has ten job openings in Boulder right now. Microsoft brought an office to Boulder when it bought the startup Vexcel. Later, Uber opened up a Boulder office when it acquired some of the Bing assets and Microsoft continued to operate here. There are plenty of other examples in Boulder alone. By my count, about 2,000 high paying, high tech, “big company” jobs in Boulder can be traced back to startups from the last decade. Not to mention the many thousands more jobs that are enabled by the current generation of startups today. This is how an active startup community impacts the broader community, well beyond just the startup community itself. It impacts all aspects of the area, including real estate, retail and housing in major ways. Next time you find yourself wondering if startups really matter to a community, take a look at Boulder and ask yourself why Google and Twitter employ so many people here. Startups are responsible for most net new jobs in America. As big companies continue to cut back, we can continue to look to startups to create our future. The purpose of Techstars’ Worldwide Entrepreneur Network is to help entrepreneurs succeed. Check out the impact of the Techstars’ network over the past 10 years.

The automatically created "People" folders in Google Photos are disappearing for some people. At least now you'll have some kind of excuse not to have to show your great-aunt pictures of your kids egg-hunting. It looks like the trouble cropped up sometime in the last few days. Google has already let people that reported the problem on their forum know that it is aware of the issue and is looking for a fix. To see if you've been affected hop on Google Photos and check your "People" album. If you see expected faces missing you're either one of the unlucky ones, or your parents' date at the school dance back in 1955 isn't going too well. In the meantime, if you discover that you are among those experiencing the problem, now you know Google is hot on the case. Should they provide an update on the forums relating to the trouble then we'll be sure to let you know.

Li Published: Apr 16, 2017 6:04 p.m. ET Share Vanessa Marcotte was killed jogging in Massachusetts last summer Getty Images/iStockphoto Police found the body of Vanessa Marcotte last August in Princeton, Mass. By DavidK. Li A suspect was arrested in the slaying of a Google executive from New York – who played a key role in the capture of her own killer, Massachusetts officials said Saturday. Angelo Colon Ortiz, a 31-year-old Worcester resident, was arrested on Friday night after his DNA matched that found on victim Vanessa Marcotte’s hands, officials said. “Good afternoon, we got him,” Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. told reporters to the cheers of bystanders. After thanking a laundry list of law enforcement agencies, Early singled out the victim and how she played the key role in Ortiz’s arrest. “There is also one other person I’d like to thank in this case, that would be Vanessa Marcotte,” Early said. “It was through her determined fight and her efforts that we obtained the DNA of her killer.” Marcotte was visiting her mom in Princeton, Mass., when she went out for a jog the afternoon of Aug. 7. Her body was found hours later in nearby woods. The 27-year-old Google accounts manager’s slaying followed the Aug. 2 murder of Queens resident Karina Vetrano. Vetrano, 30, was also out jogging when she vanished, though no solid connections were ever made between the two murders, 200 miles apart. Massachusetts authorities announced on Feb. 23 they had recovered DNA of the suspect in Marcotte’s killing — and that it didn’t match Chanel Lewis, the Brooklyn man arrested in Vetrano’s killing. Early eyewitnesses accounts noted a dark SUV driven by a Hispanic male near Marcotte’s murder scene. A state trooper recently spotted an SUV matching that description and the lawman – without a piece of paper in reach – wrote the license plate number on his hand, according to Early. Detectives eventually found Ortiz, who gave up a cheek swab of his DNA which led to his arrest, the DA said. Ortiz has been charged with aggravated assault and aggravated assault with intent to commit rape. His first court appearance is set for Tuesday. This report originally appeared on NYPost.com.

The automatically created "People" folders in Google Photos are disappearing for some people. At least now you'll have some kind of excuse not to have to show your great-aunt pictures of your kids egg-hunting. It looks like the trouble cropped up sometime in the last few days. Google has already let people that reported the problem on their forum know that it is aware of the issue and is looking for a fix. To see if you've been affected hop on Google Photos and check your "People" album. If you see expected faces missing you're either one of the unlucky ones, or your parents' date at the school dance back in 1955 isn't going too well. In the meantime, if you discover that you are among those experiencing the problem, now you know Google is hot on the case. Should they provide an update on the forums relating to the trouble then we'll be sure to let you know.

I got around it by logging out of the Photos app on the phone and using using a VPN from the States. One time thing enables it permanently.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Google Google Photos will now stabilize your shaky smartphone videos Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal April 16th, 2017 at 3:00 PM Share Tweet One of Google’s most underrated smartphone apps just quietly got even better this week. According to Android Police, the latest version of the Google Photos app will allow users to stabilize videos with the press of a button. All you need to do to stabilize your videos is download the latest version of the app on your Android device, tap on the pen icon to edit it and look for the “Stabilize” button at the bottom left. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 sales are already explosive As Android Police notes, video stabilization has been in the works for Google Photos for quite some time. Google began working to bring the feature to the app last August, and although it took nearly a year for the company to finalize it, it will be a welcome addition for anyone who uses the app and frequently takes videos. Once you hit the “Stabilize” button, you will have to wait for the video to stabilize, which could be nearly instantaneous for a short clip or take well over a minute for a longer clip.

Li Published: Apr 16, 2017 6:04 p.m. ET Share Vanessa Marcotte was killed jogging in Massachusetts last summer Getty Images/iStockphoto Police found the body of Vanessa Marcotte last August in Princeton, Mass. By DavidK. Li A suspect was arrested in the slaying of a Google executive from New York – who played a key role in the capture of her own killer, Massachusetts officials said Saturday. Angelo Colon Ortiz, a 31-year-old Worcester resident, was arrested on Friday night after his DNA matched that found on victim Vanessa Marcotte’s hands, officials said. “Good afternoon, we got him,” Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. told reporters to the cheers of bystanders. After thanking a laundry list of law enforcement agencies, Early singled out the victim and how she played the key role in Ortiz’s arrest. “There is also one other person I’d like to thank in this case, that would be Vanessa Marcotte,” Early said. “It was through her determined fight and her efforts that we obtained the DNA of her killer.” Marcotte was visiting her mom in Princeton, Mass., when she went out for a jog the afternoon of Aug. 7. Her body was found hours later in nearby woods. The 27-year-old Google accounts manager’s slaying followed the Aug. 2 murder of Queens resident Karina Vetrano. Vetrano, 30, was also out jogging when she vanished, though no solid connections were ever made between the two murders, 200 miles apart. Massachusetts authorities announced on Feb. 23 they had recovered DNA of the suspect in Marcotte’s killing — and that it didn’t match Chanel Lewis, the Brooklyn man arrested in Vetrano’s killing. Early eyewitnesses accounts noted a dark SUV driven by a Hispanic male near Marcotte’s murder scene. A state trooper recently spotted an SUV matching that description and the lawman – without a piece of paper in reach – wrote the license plate number on his hand, according to Early. Detectives eventually found Ortiz, who gave up a cheek swab of his DNA which led to his arrest, the DA said. Ortiz has been charged with aggravated assault and aggravated assault with intent to commit rape. His first court appearance is set for Tuesday. This report originally appeared on NYPost.com.

Last November, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stood on stage at the LA Auto Show and proclaimed, "data is the new oil." This is not a news, of course. For years, tech companies from Google to Facebook have drilled for data shared by connected devices and tapped into geysers of cash. Now that cars are becoming connected, automakers and others want in on the data-for-dollars boom. It's estimated that over 380 million connected cars will be on the road by 2021 globally, more than double the number now. The data they generate will be red meat to marketers since they'll be able to log people's location, driving habits, in-car entertainment choices, and more, while automakers and others will be able to better predict maintenance issues and provide other services to keep customers happy and loyal. The automotive industry is still in the very early stages of figuring out how to cash in on connected car data. Through several partnerships and acquisitions focused on advancing vehicle connectivity and refining data analytics, automotive mega supplier Delphi's recent moves give a glimpse of what the future of driving data collection could look like—and how automakers could turn massive amounts of car data into big bucks. Delphi recently acquired a minority stake in two Israeli companies. One, Valens, develops chips that can move data up to six times faster within vehicles than current technology. The other, Otonomo, has designed an agnostic data collection platform that can serve as a broker between automakers and third parties. These latest investments in connected car big data solutions are part of a larger and long-term strategy by Delphi. In 2015, the company purchased data-analytics start-up Control-Tec, while earlier this year it acquired Movimento, which provides over-the-air software update capabilities for automotive applications. If you put together the pieces of Delphi's acquisition strategy, it's easy to get a larger picture of where the company—and the auto industry—is headed with connected car data. Concrete Example of Leveraging Car Data The Otonomo investment, which was part of a recent $25 million funding round for the start-up, perhaps provides the most concrete example of how automakers could leverage vehicle data and what it means for car owners. Car & Driver noted in an article this week that "what makes [Otonomo's] services attractive to automakers is the ability to aggregate data from multiple companies and provide a more comprehensive data set to interested parties." While automakers such as Ford with its Ford Pass platform and GM with its OnStar AtYourService feature are currently supplying data to third parties in order to offer discounts and perks to drivers, an industrywide data-collecting platform could supercharge the commercial potential of connected cars. Companies ranging from auto insurance companies to roadside retailers would, of course, be eager to buy such connected car data. Related Who Should Control Connected Car Data? Who Should Control Connected Car Data? But car owners may not be so keen to have automakers harvest driving data, and consumer advocacy groups such as AAA as well as politicians have asked automakers for details on how they extract, process, and use driver data. As part of legislation sponsored by Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.), the federal government would establish standards that not only safeguard driver privacy, but also force the auto industry to be more transparent about how it is used. Delphi noted to Car & Driver that data harvested by Otonomo is anonymized and drivers can opt out of receiving connected services, although the magazine added that this "doesn't mean that drivers who do use those services would have any say in what automakers do with the data those services collect." It also pointed out that since a Republican-led Congress recently voted to roll back FCC restrictions on how ISPs can sell data collected from their customers, Markey's legislation likely has the same possibility of passing as the proverbial snowball's chance in hell. You can bet that Delphi and Otonomo will be followed by other prospectors looking to strike it rich by mining vehicle data. And it's also not too farfetched that, as Otonomo CEO Ben Volkow predicted in a CNN article earlier this year, by 2020 automakers may make more money selling vehicle data than cars themselves.

About a truth that is seldom acknowledged, and yet – on reflection – cannot be denied. The truth that we are living in an inverse welfare state. Capitalism simply isn't working and here are the reasons why | Will Hutton Read more These days, politicians from the left to the right assume that most wealth is created at the top. By the visionaries, by the job creators, and by the people who have “made it”. By the go-getters oozing talent and entrepreneurialism that are helping to advance the whole world. Now, we may disagree about the extent to which success deserves to be rewarded – the philosophy of the left is that the strongest shoulders should bear the heaviest burden, while the right fears high taxes will blunt enterprise – but across the spectrum virtually all agree that wealth is created primarily at the top. So entrenched is this assumption that it’s even embedded in our language. When economists talk about “productivity”, what they really mean is the size of your paycheck. And when we use terms like “welfare state”, “redistribution” and “solidarity”, we’re implicitly subscribing to the view that there are two strata: the makers and the takers, the producers and the couch potatoes, the hardworking citizens – and everybody else. In reality, it is precisely the other way around. In reality, it is the waste collectors, the nurses, and the cleaners whose shoulders are supporting the apex of the pyramid. They are the true mechanism of social solidarity. Meanwhile, a growing share of those we hail as “successful” and “innovative” are earning their wealth at the expense of others. The people getting the biggest handouts are not down around the bottom, but at the very top. Yet their perilous dependence on others goes unseen. Almost no one talks about it. Even for politicians on the left, it’s a non-issue. To understand why, we need to recognise that there are two ways of making money. The first is what most of us do: work. That means tapping into our knowledge and know-how (our “human capital” in economic terms) to create something new, whether that’s a takeout app, a wedding cake, a stylish updo, or a perfectly poured pint. To work is to create. Ergo, to work is to create new wealth. But there is also a second way to make money. That’s the rentier way: by leveraging control over something that already exists, such as land, knowledge, or money, to increase your wealth. You produce nothing, yet profit nonetheless. By definition, the rentier makes his living at others’ expense, using his power to claim economic benefit. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘From Wall Street to Silicon Valley, zoom in and you’ll see rentiers everywhere.’ The Facebook main campus in Menlo Park, California. Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP For those who know their history, the term “rentier” conjures associations with heirs to estates, such as the 19th century’s large class of useless rentiers, well-described by the French economist Thomas Piketty. These days, that class is making a comeback. (Ironically, however, conservative politicians adamantly defend the rentier’s right to lounge around, deeming inheritance tax to be the height of unfairness.) But there are also other ways of rent-seeking. From Wall Street to Silicon Valley, from big pharma to the lobby machines in Washington and Westminster, zoom in and you’ll see rentiers everywhere. There is no longer a sharp dividing line between working and rentiering. In fact, the modern-day rentier often works damn hard. Countless people in the financial sector, for example, apply great ingenuity and effort to amass “rent” on their wealth. Even the big innovations of our age – businesses like Facebook and Uber – are interested mainly in expanding the rentier economy. The problem with most rich people therefore is not that they are coach potatoes. Many a CEO toils 80 hours a week to multiply his allowance. It’s hardly surprising, then, that they feel wholly entitled to their wealth. It may take quite a mental leap to see our economy as a system that shows solidarity with the rich rather than the poor. So I’ll start with the clearest illustration of modern freeloaders at the top: bankers. Studies conducted by the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements – not exactly leftist thinktanks – have revealed that much of the financial sector has become downright parasitic. How instead of creating wealth, they gobble it up whole. Don’t get me wrong. Banks can help to gauge risks and get money where it is needed, both of which are vital to a well-functioning economy. But consider this: economists tell us that the optimum level of total private-sector debt is 100% of GDP. Based on this equation, if the financial sector only grows, it won’t equal more wealth, but less. So here’s the bad news. In the United Kingdom, private-sector debt is now at 157.5%. In the United States, the figure is 188.8%. In other words, a big part of the modern banking sector is essentially a giant tapeworm gorging on a sick body. It’s not creating anything new, merely sucking others dry. Bankers have found a hundred and one ways to accomplish this. The basic mechanism, however, is always the same: offer loans like it’s going out of style, which in turn inflates the price of things like houses and shares, then earn a tidy percentage off those overblown prices (in the form of interest, commissions, brokerage fees, or what have you), and if the shit hits the fan, let Uncle Sam mop it up. The financial innovation concocted by all the math whizzes working in modern banking (instead of at universities or companies that contribute to real prosperity) basically boils down to maximising the total amount of debt. And debt, of course, is a means of earning rent. So for those who believe that pay ought to be proportionate to the value of work, the conclusion we have to draw is that many bankers should be earning a negative salary; a fine, if you will, for destroying more wealth than they create. Bankers are the most obvious class of closet freeloaders, but they are certainly not alone. Many a lawyer and an accountant wields a similar revenue model. Take tax evasion. Untold hardworking, academically degreed professionals make a good living at the expense of the populations of other countries. Or take the tide of privatisations over the past three decades, which have been all but a carte blanche for rentiers. One of the richest people in the world, Carlos Slim, earned his millions by obtaining a monopoly of the Mexican telecom market and then hiking prices sky high. The same goes for the Russian oligarchs who rose after the Berlin Wall fell, who bought up valuable state-owned assets for song to live off the rent. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘One of the richest people in the world, Carlos Slim, earned his millions by obtaining a monopoly of the Mexican telecom market and then hiking prices sky high.’ Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters But here comes the rub. Most rentiers are not as easily identified as the greedy banker or manager. Many are disguised. On the face of it, they look like industrious folks, because for part of the time they really are doing something worthwhile. Precisely that makes us overlook their massive rent-seeking. Take the pharmaceutical industry. Companies like GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer regularly unveil new drugs, yet most real medical breakthroughs are made quietly at government-subsidised labs. Private companies mostly manufacture medications that resemble what we’ve already got. They get it patented and, with a hefty dose of marketing, a legion of lawyers, and a strong lobby, can live off the profits for years. In other words, the vast revenues of the pharmaceutical industry are the result of a tiny pinch of innovation and fistfuls of rent. Even paragons of modern progress like Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Uber and Airbnb are woven from the fabric of rentierism. Firstly, because they owe their existence to government discoveries and inventions (every sliver of fundamental technology in the iPhone, from the internet to batteries and from touchscreens to voice recognition, was invented by researchers on the government payroll). And second, because they tie themselves into knots to avoid paying taxes, retaining countless bankers, lawyers, and lobbyists for this very purpose. Even more important, many of these companies function as “natural monopolies”, operating in a positive feedback loop of increasing growth and value as more and more people contribute free content to their platforms. Companies like this are incredibly difficult to compete with, because as they grow bigger, they only get stronger. Aptly characterising this “platform capitalism” in an article, Tom Goodwin writes: “Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Every sliver of fundamental technology in the iPhone, from the internet to batteries and from touchscreens to voice recognition, was invented by researchers on the government payroll.’ Photograph: Regis Duvignau/Reuters So what do these companies own? A platform. A platform that lots and lots of people want to use. Why? First and foremost, because they’re cool and they’re fun – and in that respect, they do offer something of value. However, the main reason why we’re all happy to hand over free content to Facebook is because all of our friends are on Facebook too, because their friends are on Facebook … because their friends are on Facebook. Most of Mark Zuckerberg’s income is just rent collected off the millions of picture and video posts that we give away daily for free. And sure, we have fun doing it. But we also have no alternative – after all, everybody is on Facebook these days. Zuckerberg has a website that advertisers are clamouring to get onto, and that doesn’t come cheap. Don’t be fooled by endearing pilots with free internet in Zambia. Stripped down to essentials, it’s an ordinary ad agency. In fact, in 2015 Google and Facebook pocketed an astounding 64% of all online ad revenue in the US. But don’t Google and Facebook make anything useful at all? Sure they do. The irony, however, is that their best innovations only make the rentier economy even bigger. They employ scores of programmers to create new algorithms so that we’ll all click on more and more ads. Uber has usurped the whole taxi sector just as Airbnb has upended the hotel industry and Amazon has overrun the book trade. The bigger such platforms grow the more powerful they become, enabling the lords of these digital feudalities to demand more and more rent. Think back a minute to the definition of a rentier: someone who uses their control over something that already exists in order to increase their own wealth. The feudal lord of medieval times did that by building a tollgate along a road and making everybody who passed by pay. Today’s tech giants are doing basically the same thing, but transposed to the digital highway. Using technology funded by taxpayers, they build tollgates between you and other people’s free content and all the while pay almost no tax on their earnings. Wolfgang Streeck: ‘Look at London – it’s a second Rome. This is what an empire looks like’ Read more This is the so-called innovation that has Silicon Valley gurus in raptures: ever bigger platforms that claim ever bigger handouts. So why do we accept this? Why does most of the population work itself to the bone to support these rentiers? I think there are two answers. Firstly, the modern rentier knows to keep a low profile. There was a time when everybody knew who was freeloading. The king, the church, and the aristocrats controlled almost all the land and made peasants pay dearly to farm it. But in the modern economy, making rentierism work is a great deal more complicated. How many people can explain a credit default swap, or a collateralised debt obligation? Or the revenue model behind those cute Google Doodles? And don’t the folks on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley work themselves to the bone, too? Well then, they must be doing something useful, right? Maybe not. The typical workday of Goldman Sachs’ CEO may be worlds away from that of King Louis XIV, but their revenue models both essentially revolve around obtaining the biggest possible handouts. “The world’s most powerful investment bank,” wrote the journalist Matt Taibbi about Goldman Sachs, “is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.” But far from squids and vampires, the average rich freeloader manages to masquerade quite successfully as a decent hard worker. He goes to great lengths to present himself as a “job creator” and an “investor” who “earns” his income by virtue of his high “productivity”. Most economists, journalists, and politicians from left to right are quite happy to swallow this story. Time and again language is twisted around to cloak funneling and exploitation as creation and generation. However, it would be wrong to think that all this is part of some ingenious conspiracy. Many modern rentiers have convinced even themselves that they are bona fide value creators. When current Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein was asked about the purpose of his job, his straight-faced answer was that he is “doing God’s work”. The Sun King would have approved. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘A big part of the modern banking sector is essentially a giant tapeworm gorging on a sick body.’ Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images The second thing that keeps rentiers safe is even more insidious. We’re all wannabe rentiers. They have made millions of people complicit in their revenue model. Consider this: What are our financial sector’s two biggest cash cows? Answer: the housing market and pensions. Both are markets in which many of us are deeply invested. Recent decades have seen more and more people contract debts to buy a home, and naturally it’s in their interest if house prices continue to scale new heights (read: burst bubble upon bubble). The same goes for pensions. Over the past few decades we’ve all scrimped and saved up a mountainous pension piggy bank. Now pension funds are under immense pressure to ally with the biggest exploiters in order to ensure they pay out enough to please their investors. The fact of the matter is that feudalism has been democratised. To a lesser or greater extent, we are all depending on handouts. En masse, we have been made complicit in this exploitation by the rentier elite, resulting in a political covenant between the rich rent-seekers and the homeowners and retirees. Don’t get me wrong, most homeowners and retirees are not benefiting from this situation. On the contrary, the banks are bleeding them far beyond the extent to which they themselves profit from their houses and pensions. Still, it’s hard to point fingers at a kleptomaniac when you have sticky fingers too. So why is this happening? The answer can be summed up in three little words: Because it can. Rentierism is, in essence, a question of power. That the Sun King Louis XIV was able to exploit millions was purely because he had the biggest army in Europe. It’s no different for the modern rentier. He’s got the law, politicians and journalists squarely in his court. That’s why bankers get fined peanuts for preposterous fraud, while a mother on government assistance gets penalised within an inch of her life if she checks the wrong box. The biggest tragedy of all, however, is that the rentier economy is gobbling up society’s best and brightest. Where once upon a time Ivy League graduates chose careers in science, public service or education, these days they are more likely to opt for banks, law firms, or trumped up ad agencies like Google and Facebook. When you think about it, it’s insane. We are forking over billions in taxes to help our brightest minds on and up the corporate ladder so they can learn how to score ever more outrageous handouts. Meet the rightwing power players lurking beneath Silicon Valley's liberal facade Read more One thing is certain: countries where rentiers gain the upper hand gradually fall into decline. Just look at the Roman Empire. Or Venice in the 15th century. Look at the Dutch Republic in the 18th century. Like a parasite stunts a child’s growth, so the rentier drains a country of its vitality. What innovation remains in a rentier economy is mostly just concerned with further bolstering that very same economy. This may explain why the big dreams of the 1970s, like flying cars, curing cancer, and colonising Mars, have yet to be realised, while bankers and ad-makers have at their fingertips technologies a thousand times more powerful. Yet it doesn’t have to be this way. Tollgates can be torn down, financial products can be banned, tax havens dismantled, lobbies tamed, and patents rejected. Higher taxes on the ultra-rich can make rentierism less attractive, precisely because society’s biggest freeloaders are at the very top of the pyramid. And we can more fairly distribute our earnings on land, oil, and innovation through a system of, say, employee shares, or a universal basic income. But such a revolution will require a wholly different narrative about the origins of our wealth. It will require ditching the old-fashioned faith in “solidarity” with a miserable underclass that deserves to be borne aloft on the market-level salaried shoulders of society’s strongest. All we need to do is to give real hard-working people what they deserve. And, yes, by that I mean the waste collectors, the nurses, the cleaners – theirs are the shoulders that carry us all. • Pre-order Utopia for Realists and How Can We Get There by Rutger Bregman • Translated from the original Dutch by Elizabeth Manton Topics Money Opinion Banks and building societies Economics Economic growth (GDP) Google Facebook comment Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Post an ad EDITORIAL: Trump lets generals manage our wars By: The Gazette editorial board April 16, 2017 Updated: April 16, 2017 at 11:08 am 0 This photo provided by Eglin Air Force Base shows the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb. The Pentagon says U.S. forces in Afghanistan dropped the military's largest non-nuclear bomb on an Islamic State target in Afghanistan. A Pentagon spokesman said it was the first-ever combat use of the bomb, known as the GBU-43, which he said contains 11 tons of explosives. The Air Force calls it the Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb. Based on the acronym, it has been nicknamed the "Mother Of All Bombs." (Eglin Air Force Base via AP)  The Air Force dropped "the mother of all bombs" on Afghanistan on Thursday. Public anxiety caused "World War 3" searches on Google to hit their highest level since the search engine began keeping records in 2004. The bombing has the world's population on edge, as people of all nations speculate whether such aggression by the United States will subdue America's enemies or inspire retaliation. Only time will reveal the ultimate ripple effects of this maneuver and other actions our military could take soon. President Donald Trump has given military officials broad latitude in deciding how to defeat IS and other enemies of the United States. White House micromanagement of the battlefield is officially over. The decision to bomb Afghanistan was reportedly made by Army Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Early reports indicate the bomb killed 94 IS fighters. The Department of Defense reports no civilian casualties. Among many who have fought on the ground in the Middle East, the bombing and empowerment of generals comes as welcome relief. "You're dealing with people who only understand force," said Rob O'Neill, the former Navy SEAL credited with killing Osama Bin Laden. Former Marine Johnny "Joey" Jones was a bomb technician in Helmand province in Afghanistan in 2010. When Jones was 23, his legs were blown off as he worked to diffuse and clear roadside bombs from a shelled-out "ghost town." After Thursday's bombing, he tweeted appreciation for Trump allowing generals to manage the war. "I lost my legs because my gov't was afraid to use the tools they had and saw me as expendable. I wish I'd had this admin.," Jones wrote. When challenged by someone who wanted to know how a bombing could possibly have saved his legs, Jones responded. "We begged to use bombs on the minefield ghost town I lost my legs clearing. But by all means-continue your rhetorically righteous tweeting," Jones wrote. On Fox News, Jones said he felt President Barack Obama's administration was more worried about public opinion than the lives of combat troops. "At the time, you know the headline, 'U.S. drops bombs' or 'fires artillery' just wasn't worth it. I guess risking us was. That's how I feel, that's how we felt then," Jones said. Americans don't like war. We should use our military might with great discretion. Intervention should be an option of last resort, when all diplomatic measures fail to uphold our vital interests. When we are at war, for whatever reason, we have the moral obligation to win. Trump has given his top generals "total authorization" to do so. Humanity should hope and pray they use it to achieve world peace. Comment Policy You must be logged into gazette.com in order to post comments. Please log in or Create an account to start commenting.

Fact Check goes global for Search and Google News results Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 8:33am PDTApr 7, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 72 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares151 Google News The internet is a vast, wonderful, and sometimes dangerous place that allows for most people to find troves of information. Unfortunately, as we all know, not all of that is factually true. Back in October, Google introduced a method for publishers in certain countries to display a "Fact Check" tag next to their content in Search and News results. This signifies that the article had been verified as true by news and fact-checking organizations. The big announcement today is that this is rolling out globally in all languages. The information will appear clearly in a relevant search result, as you can see in the image above. It is important to keep in mind that not everything you query will be applicable and that there may be conflicting statements of "true" or "false" if multiple entities have fact-checked the information and arrived at differing conclusions. Google makes it very clear that it has nothing to do with this process; it is simply contributing to giving users the ability to make informed decisions for themselves.

M. Luciano They're not taking any action against them, just applying an informative label .. which is sorta what they do - provide information. Jordan Palmer Again, not sure what this has to do with censorship. Google is simply providing a tag that labels if an article has been fact-checked and by whom. You make the decision for yourself if you're willing to read/believe it. Nick I think people see it as Google delegating fact-checking to certain parties and people do not trust these certain parties or fear they will not be trustworthy sometime in the future. I don't have these problems, but it does highlight some deeper issues, some of which this does not solve. M. Luciano Right, but even if the labels are wrong, they're still labels. Are they changing the search rankings or choosing not to display content based on the labels? 7-down "Are they changing the search rankings or choosing not to display content based on the labels?" Not right now, no. But I have a feeling that it will happen in the near future once Google's algorithm orders what it thinks "fake news" should be listed and what shouldn't. Nick I trust Google to provide correct and relevant information all the time, most of us do. However, since this is a politically related feature people are afraid that suddenly an algorithm is going to give them incorrect information. While I do find that notion silly, I think it would be better for these folks if such an algorithm would be open source so people can verify that Google didn't code in some intentional bias into it. Klark Kenneth It was my understanding that at it's most basic level, Google isn't providing the information, at least not the foundation of the information itself but rather an index, or aggregate if you will, of all the information that's already out there. So I wouldn't blame Google or hold them responsible if I read an article on a certain news site that I found from a Google search and that said article wasn't factual. Nick That was my basic understanding too, but you can provide favorability when you are indexing. Again, I do find the notion silly, but speaking strictly for American thought on anything political, we don't fully trust anyone. Klark Kenneth I wholeheartedly agree! DKBNYC Google does not provide information. It only gives you access to information. Klark Kenneth "Google does not provide information. It's only one a several search engines that points you to relevant information you're looking for." FIFY abc Yes, Google should just open-source the algorithm that helped build the entire company. Nick Haha, I was highlighting how absurd it was for people to suddenly become afraid of an algorithm, sorry if that wasn't obvious enough. M. Luciano Even if they do start ranking results based on this information, wouldn't that be a good thing? Pushing the most relevant and accurate information to top and reducing the prevalence of false data? Klark Kenneth I see it as good thing but the question has to be asked of the news and fact checking organizations in reference to their credibility and integrity as it relates to their fact checking. Who do we trust? I mean I can further fact check the fact checking that's already been done so that I end up trusting my own research, which I do half the time anyway. 7-down "Even if they do start ranking results based on this information, wouldn't that be a good thing?" But how would Google know which is true and which isn't? Google got in trouble in past for promoting spammy/pirate sites. These machines aren't as smart as we think they are, problems will happen. M. Luciano I assume it'd be based on an analysis of the 115 or however many there are at the time trustworthy fact checking organizations, but obviously I can't know how that hypothetical would work. I'm not suggesting they should do it, just that if they were to decided to do so and could do so accurately, it wouldn't actually harm anyone. https://reporterslab.org/fact-checking/ Nick Uh, well, if we're going off feelings here, I feel that Google would not ruin their reputation, in fact that'd be a very poor business decision. I'd actually to go as far to argue that something like this is perfect for an algorithm to do because evaluating sources can be open to a person's bias and cross checking the information is tedious and time consuming. TheSpaceUnicorn If the labels can be wrong, then there's literally no point in even having them. Dundun Dundun I do that already though. Also, now that I think of it, this is actually the height of arrogance from Google. I already knew they thought they were better than everyone else, but wow, they think we're all idiots. abc It gets even worse. You know how Google gives you search results right? But what about all the results they don't show you!!! George Byers The beginning of censorship on the Internet. M. Luciano Labeling whether or not something is accurate is censoring it? Sir_Brizz This isn't just "labeling". The sites that are used to "fact check" all have an unhealthy record of fact checking. It's not very hard to find a supposed "fact check" where the content of the check doesn't match with the score that was given. There is no scenario in which this ends well. M. Luciano It literally is just labeling, even if you disagree with the labels or even if the labels are incorrect. No content is being removed or even ranked differently from what we can tell - so all the content is still there, unchanged, with an extra information box available for those who care to know how accurate the information is. Pretty simple. And of the organizations here: https://reporterslab.org/fact-checking/ are producing incorrect information? Source? Sir_Brizz The problem is that the labels aren't always correct. But the implication of including them in the search results is that they are correct and inform the people searching what is correct and incorrect information. That's not a good thing. Also, Snopes and PolitiFact and FactCheck have all been caught giving wrong scores, scoring based on partisanship, and giving opinion based scores multiple times. The roll up scores are utterly meaningless. They also cherry pick the things they even decide to fact check so they can use aggregated data to show trends that don't even exist. There is no such thing as a good fact checker. M. Luciano Even if 100% of the labels were incorrect, they don't actually impact the visibility or veracity of the content they are labeling. So even if you believe the effort is misguided, it's pretty much impossible to accurately call it censorship. I haven't heard of any of the fact checking places intentionally providing incorrect information, so if you have sources for them being dishonest I'd love to read about that. Sir_Brizz I never said censorship, but it is far from simply labeling the information because the label carries an implication of accuracy. M. Luciano Roger that; we're in a comment chain that begins with me questioning how this is censorship. My fault for the confusion. Sir_Brizz You also said it was labeling, which is what my comment stemmed from. Sorry for the confusion. pfmiller I've seen that accusation made about Snopes, but it always turns out the person saying they're wrong misread the article. So do you have any specific examples you can provide? Sir_Brizz I didn't call out Snopes specifically, although I know they have some incorrectly reasoned conclusions while being generally accurate. PolitiFact, however, has a pretty horrible track record, doesn't follow their own procedures and standards, and has several fact checks that say they are not true at all while reading the content of the fact check shows that the statements were mostly true but injecting PolitiFact's own biases into them makes them false. Who are the whistleblowers on the fact check industry? Here's one blog that at least tries to keep them honest. Not that it has been effective over the years they have been doing this. http://www.politifactbias.com/ Still, the more important thing about the fact that a blog like this can exist is that facts are rarely black and white, and that you can slant almost any factual information in any way you want. And rollup truth meters are meaningless and undermine fact checking. A Person Who decides what is accurate and how did they reach their conclusion? M. Luciano For now it seems to be associated with these folks: https://reporterslab.org/fact-checking/ But as indicated below, whether or not something is labeled correctly does not impact whether or not it is censorship. The information is not being hidden or removed, it simply has additional information available for those seeking more knowledge about the content. A Person That was a rhetorical question. M. Luciano Weird, because it has a very straightforward and easily ascertained answer as a sincere question as well. Dundun Dundun So if I label you as a criminal of some sort, it won't have any impact on you at all, it's just a label.... right... M. Luciano Would you be doing so based on an independent objective analysis of my statements? Dundun Dundun How would you know? But sure, Google told me. M. Luciano Sounds like we're not talking about the topic at hand. Dundun Dundun Wtf are you talking about then? This is about Google using private sources to inform an algorithm of how "true" or not news is, and then displaying that information on the search results. This will lead to filtering, guaranteed. If everyone decided you were a rapist because you said "grab her by the pussy" then it would be deemed true, because they'd all be in agreement. Half the articles about Trump were fake news, since it was all mostly hyperbole and extrapolation, and most of it was by the MSM. Same shit happened to Nigel Farrage in England, but obviously to a lesser extent, but branded a racist. I doubt somehow this algorithm would recognize the bias, and I wouldn't trust Google to check for it either since they consulted Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe fucking whatever on how to police the internet. If nothing else, at least step back and ask "why". What in particular prompted this? Why is this needed now? Is this even a good thing for free press? (answer: no it isn't) M. Luciano Read the source link, what you're describing is not what's happening. Dundun Dundun Don't say I didn't warn ya. What I described is happening. Schema? Never heard of them. Why is Google turning itself into wikipedia-but-only-some-people-can-edit? Because you have to be a recognized/approved source on Schema to contribute to the Google shit, why? Who the hell is Schema?? But whatever. If you think you need this to decipher truth from non-truth, or you think the truth is that clear-cut, then have-at-it! Personally, I will drop Google and use Bing. abc Read the article. It's been answered. TheSpaceUnicorn He didn't say it was, it said it's the beginning. Only a fool wouldn't see the dangerous slippery slope this creates and the implications this has on the future if it's approached with ill intent. M. Luciano What's the intent behind this? https://blog.google/products/search/fact-check-now-available-google-search-and-news-around-world/ TheSpaceUnicorn It's like you didn't even read my comment. M. Luciano Implications of this is done with I'll intent. Is this being done with bad intentions? Seems pretty important to discern that. TheSpaceUnicorn Please, quote where I said this is being done with bad intentions, because that's not what I said. M. Luciano You indicated that it would be bad if this were to be done with bad intentions. I am asking for your assessment of whether or not this current action is being done with positive or negative intentions. Is what Google is doing right now a step that they are making out of malice or is it something they're doing to try to help? TheSpaceUnicorn It's obviously something they're doing to try and help, that however doesn't alleviate them from the slippery slope this presents. Chris Lambert I don't see a slippery slope when the phrase "Hold on, this is bullshit!" is used. It probably should be used more often. TheSpaceUnicorn Really? You don't see how this could potentially turn into something where Google promotes a political agenda they agree with? Understand, I'm not saying this is a bad thing, I'm just saying we all need to be absolutly sure this will always remain third party and impartial. Dundun Dundun It actually doesn't have to be done with ill intent, it can be done with "good" intent. The whole thing is being done with "good intent" in the first place, but it's totally unnecessary and won't make any positive difference and will have false positives, and false negatives, and the end result is that people will be misinformed on some issues when they shouldn't be. It's an attempt at poisoning the well, which is an attempt to control what you think. That is literally all this will accomplish. People can already do their own research if they're so inclined. Today's media is powerful enough without having Google award them with a badge of truthiness. No good can come from this, it's transparent as day that this is a political move. Do you actually think that papers like the Guardian will ever be deemed "fake news" even if they're 100% wrong? 4Ui812 That sounds like fearing mongering. verboze By this logic, one could argue censorship has been in place for decades. After all, search engines only surface results they deem relevant, and most people won't bother looking past the first few results. I don't see how offering additional information is implicative of censorship. The original information is presented alongside the results, and users are free to decide what to believe for themselves. I would bite your argument if they were removing the original assertion. abc Uhm, if search engines wanted to censor content, they could, you know, simply not display it in the search results. TheSpaceUnicorn Sure, and who's to say in the future they won't start factoring in what fact checkers say to influence what content doesn't get displayed in the search results? There just needs to be a guarantee that this will never become anything more than just a label and that the labels will always be true and purely objective. Amarus Kh What's being censored? The way I see it, it's basically the same as showing movie ratings when you look for a movie. You can still choose for yourself what you want to read and believe or not. Jordan Palmer This has absolutely nothing to do with censorship. Vivek Rameses This is the very definition of censorship. M. Luciano How so? They're applying a label to results, not changing results. They're informing people about what type of content they're presented with. What do you think censorship is? Ryan Cavitt It's trying to silence things by applying negative labels to them. Much like people are labeled as racists for disagreeing with Black Lies Matter. M. Luciano That's a very poor definition and it misses the point of this proposal. Presumably you think that applying a label that something is factually incorrect is a negative label which would mean that a label that says something is factually correct is a positive label. So if there are both positive and negative labels then you could also look at this as promoting the truth rather than disparaging the lies. The fact that you choose to look at this as an assault against something is very strange since all it is doing is giving consumers more information to be able to make Intelligent Decisions about how they choose to use their time. Ryan Cavitt These fact checkers always lie by omission, they always leave out a key part of the story that changes the situation entirely, that or the rating does not always line up with the associated article. So they are using the label "incorrect" as a way to shame and silence the smaller media outlets. If you rely on a "fact checker" instead of doing the homework yourself, then you are incapable of making intelligent decisions and you should be laughed off of any debate floor. M. Luciano Can you please provide evidence that every fact check always misrepresented the facts? As indicated elsewhere, the fact checkers typically provide their sources, meaning that you can easily read those sources for yourself. Ryan Cavitt Where did I say they always misrepresented that facts? That is a logical fallacy known as Strawman. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LimZhkArmXU M. Luciano "These fact checkers always lie by omission, they always leave out a key part of the story that changes the situation entirely, that or the rating does not always line up with the associated article. " Did you mean something else? Sir_Brizz You said that he claimed "every fact check always misrepresented the facts". He did not say that or imply that. M. Luciano He literally said they always lie by omission or give a rating unjustified by the article. Sir_Brizz He said they always do one of two things: misrepresent the facts, or the rating doesn't line up with the facts. M. Luciano And producing a conclusion that doesn't accurately reflect the data is misrepresenting the facts, as is lying by omission. So either way, they are implying every single fact checking article by every single fact checker is intentionally misleading readers. So that type of far out claim should require substantiation. Otherwise we could say that sometimes they do or occasionally they do... But even that sort of an outrageous claim attacking their work should be backed up by evidence. Has it ever happened? Are you positive they did so maliciously? Was that proven? Did they post a retraction? Sir_Brizz I'm not going to argue what anyone "always" does. However, you should be a bit more specific about what you disagree with if you're going to split hairs. Also, I wouldn't call the rollup score "misrepresenting facts" explicitly because the rollup score is based on what the author thinks. It doesn't have to line up with the stated facts. That's why rollup scoring is stupid on fact checks, and why including rollup scores on Google is equally stupid. M. Luciano I could be led to accept that as possible, but that's pretty different from what the person that's accusing me of lying said. Sir_Brizz Fair. Ryan Cavitt Isn't it nice when you can twist words to suit your narrative? I am glad I am able to debate honestly. M. Luciano You said they always lie. Prove that. Right now you're pretending I'm lying, which is dishonest in itself. If I misunderstood you, then explain yourself clearly. Ryan Cavitt I am under no obligation to prove your strawman and Sir_Brizz already explained your mistake. M. Luciano It's not my straw man; I restated yours. We can be done though, you're clearly disingenuous. If you were sincere, you would have welcomed the opportunity to clarify your position. Anyway, have a good one. Ryan Cavitt I dont need to, you need to grasp the English language. " they always leave out a key part of the story that changes the situation entirely, THAT OR THE RATING DOES NOT ALWAYS LINE UP WITH THE ASSOCIATED ARTICLE." Until you take the entire argument instead of a cherry pick, you have lost. M. Luciano Sound good mate, cya later. Chris Lambert He literally just quoted you. Ryan Cavitt No, he really didn't. He just cherry picked out what he liked then left out the rest. He'd make a great writer for a "fact checker!" Maybe he could also give a rating that does not exactly line up with the article too! Klark Kenneth Yes, please give us the updated definition of censorship since it obviously no longer means suppression or prohibition of, in this particular case, news and information. We'll wait. verboze lol abc No, it's not. A Person I would argue that it censors credibility. M. Luciano Can you elaborate on what you mean by that? A Person You're researching any certain topic and before you even have a chance to read the article and form your own opinion, you're told whether you should find it credible. Just remember that "fake news" didn't exist prior to Hillary's 2016 election loss... so who do you think is at the wheel of this bullsh!t monolith? M. Luciano That's actually a great reason to do this. You're doing research and a) you don't have to waste your time on things that have been proven to be incorrect and b) you don't have to waste your time on things that have been proven to be correct UNLESS you want to link to the fact checker's analysis and use THEIR primary sources. Because you don't use CBS and NBC, Wikipedia and Snopes or whatever for research, you use actual credible sources - scholarly research that's held up to critique, primary sources, etc. So if you see this tag, it's only usefulness in a research setting is to click on the fact checker's analysis in order to get the fastest access possible to the actual facts you'd need to do a credible analysis of your own. Also, fact checking organizations have been around for a long time. They didn't start last year. Sir_Brizz "you don't have to waste your time on things that have been proven to be incorrect" That might work if this was that, but it's not. "A fact checker found this to be wrong" doesn't always line up with "this is actually wrong information". M. Luciano I am describing that it is a quicker way to get to the actual information. So rather than reading a bunch of irrelevant sources or their interpretation of events and rather than taking the fact Checkers word for it, you can instead just use their link to the original data itself and analyze that. Knowledgeborn Allah That sounds good in theory, but how many people do you actually expect to do that? I can assure you that most people won't... And then, citing this precedent, it's only a matter of time before other "news" organizations, like Fox News and Breitbart, start coming out with their own 'fact-checkers' to support their perspectives. Sir_Brizz The point is that they are baking an implication into the search results already. The fact that they show up next to the news sources themselves gives the fact checks higher relevance than they might otherwise have. That doesn't help anything. Sir_Brizz "Fake news" has existed for centuries. The past 30 years roughly are the first time in the history of the world that we even have the capability to understand what is true and what is false from the media or anywhere else. As long as a media has existed, it has been used to spread propaganda and drive public opinion. This time in history is not unique on that in any tangible way. That being said, you're right that the first time anyone cared about it was when Hillary's campaign started trotting it around as the exclusive reason for Trump doing so well. A Person I'm not going to pretend you're stupid simply because we disagree. I am obviously speaking of the new found and near-daily media coverage. You know that's what I mean. I know fake news has existed forever. I'm speaking specifically to the media attention it's garnered since the election: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=fake%20news Sir_Brizz I wasn't saying that to disagree with you but to point out that this whole "post-truth" hysteria has no basis in fact itself. Chris Lambert Bullshit has been around for a long time. abc Sure, it didn't exist because there are no countries on earth other than America. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lying_press O’Malley (Deplorable) Fact checking is a made up liberal construct Klark Kenneth What?!? The liberal comment aside, checking if something is factual or not is made up? Nick It's a joke about America's political climate. Then again I can never tell anymore. Klark Kenneth Well in that case, LMAO. After I posted the comment I wondered if I'd missed the point and I see that I did, or may have. pfmiller If someone calls themselves deplorable, believe them. O’Malley (Deplorable) Let's see... Google practically had their own office in the Whitehouse when Obama was president. Google is run by liberals so their fact checking is, by default, a joke. Klark Kenneth Can I fact check your practicality claim? Let me search Google... O’Malley (Deplorable) Please do. I believe Google accounted for the most visits to the Whitehouse Jordan Palmer Once more, Google is NOT doing the fact-checking. O’Malley (Deplorable) Hahaha ericshmerick But they are deciding which fact checking sites to include in their search results. So, they are fact checking. And lol @ snopes. Their agenda is really obvious. M. Luciano They are testing each site that chooses to apply to see if their publication meets standards. Those that are not qualified to do so are not included. That's not like cherry picking which fact checkers agree with you, it's a simple step to exclude those that are going to sabotage the project. MJ See folks... This man's brain has been so damaged by fake news and other Internet morons over the years all he can see is "liberal" conspiracies in everything. So sad it's to late for him... O’Malley (Deplorable) The real difference between you and I is that I can do my own fact checking. I can do critical thinking. You (liberals) need some monkey in an office to tell you what to read. YOU need censorship because you can't think for yourself. M. Luciano No one is censoring anything. Based on some of your comments, you're not even capable of comprehending the article here, let alone fact checking it. A thing is true or not regardless of any individual's political leanings. That's how facts work. Are you suggesting that you could see one article that's confirmed as accurate and another that's confirmed as false and somehow through your powers of critical thinking you'd believe that the false one was true and the true one was false? That doesn't make you smart, that makes you either gullible or delusional. Neither one of those are strong indicators of critical analysis. George if you're doing your own fact checking... then you're a liberal... M. Luciano Facts don't have political bias. They are true or not on their own. Sir_Brizz "Facts" can be slanted to support just about any worldview you'd like to support. pfmiller Sure, "facts" can be. Facts, on the other hand, can not be. Sir_Brizz Lots of facts are "facts" and the only reason you think they are facts is because the person fact checking them is someone you agree with. pfmiller No, the reason I think they are facts is because they have been documented as so. Legitimate fact checkers always provide their sources. Sir_Brizz So you don't consider Snopes or PolitiFact as legitimate then, since they have failed to provide their sources on numerous occasions? If a fact checker injects any bias into their fact checks (which happens a lot in all directions) it casts doubt on both their ability to fact check and the entire fact checking industry. Fact checkers are the ones destroying fact checking. pfmiller I don't recall ever seeing an unsourced article on Snopes. Again, do you have any specific examples? Sir_Brizz I didn't say "unsourced". I'm not sure there is an article on Snopes without a single source. Still, providing sources doesn't even make them legitimate. There is this story: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/12/22/the-daily-mail-snopes-story-and-fact-checking-the-fact-checkers/#152ec7ef227f There are numerous cases where a fact check was determined to be True or False based on hearsay (where an "unknown" or "unverified" would have been more accurate). There are also several cases where the claims that are fact checked don't really line up with the statement they claim to be fact checking. There is more to fact checking than providing sources. pfmiller I don't understand. There is nothing in that article or the article it is about that provides an example of a misleading article on Snopes. Sir_Brizz I never said that article had an example of a misleading fact check. That article, and lots of other things, cast doubt on the accuracy and neutrality of Snopes. There are similar problems with PolitiFact. These organizations drag down the credibility of the entire industry. Someone else posted a video that has multiple examples of misleading fact checks by Snopes. They are also not that hard to find. pfmiller If they aren't so hard to find I'm surprised you haven't found one yet after multiple requests. This article doesn't do anything to cast doubt on Snopes' credibility since their credibility is based on the quality of the articles themselves. Sir_Brizz http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-freed-child-rapist-laughed-about-it/ Let's see if you can figure out what is wrong with this fact check. Also, the credibility of the organization Snopes absolutely has something to do with the credibility of their fact checks. More than anything, that article points out the multitude of ways that Snopes is not transparent or open about their processes and why being that way casts doubt on their credibility. pfmiller I'm going to say it doesn't fit the narrative the right has created about Clinton. Am I right? Sir_Brizz LOL. I see that you don't have any interest in objectivity here. I don't think this story mattered at all. However, whether the story matters or not has nothing to do with this fact check. pfmiller So what do you think is wrong with the article? M. Luciano The fact is a bit of information that exists independently of the person perceiving it's perception of it. Whether or not someone is able to add information or context in order to mislead does not impact the actual fact itself. Sir_Brizz Please show me a political based fact check that does nothing other than deal with the very specific and narrow definition of whether the stated information is factual or not. Knowledgeborn Allah And this is exactly why I'm not a big fan of this change... Fact-checking is good in theory, but people manipulate facts all the time to justify their biases and preconceived worldviews. Recently, that's proven to be especially true when it comes to politics. There's no such thing as unbiased (or neutral) journalism. And, at the end of the day, people are going to believe whatever they want to believe anyway. George that was in response to O'Malley (Deplorable)....... you missed the /s Chris Lambert This. MJ The difference between me and you is I am NOT idiot. There is NO censorship going on so you don't even understand the basic facts of what this post is about. You presume I am liberal and I don't do my own fact checking. You literally have NOTHING to contribute to this discussion. Thanks for playing. M. Luciano Fact checking is only controversial if you have a worldview that is based on feelings rather than facts. A Person Don't remove a key part of the statement's context and then ask him to justify the new one that you've constructed. M. Luciano Ok, let's try this one: "In what way is 'fact checking a made up liberal construct'?" A Person "Fake news" wasn't a thing till the moment the Democrats were absolutely raped in the 2016 election cycle. Now, it's all you hear about. Same with Russia: "The '80s called, Mitt, they want their foreign policy back, lol"... "Mr. Trump should grow up. Our elections cannot be hacked"... and then they lost, and now? Surprise surprise! M. Luciano Weird verboze While we're here debating the veracity of fact-checking, those who benefit from the doubt cast are on to their businesses. Right or wrong, fact-checking OPTIONAL analysis to consider, and does not deter from actually reading the original content and forming one's own opinion. No one will be forcing you to accept fact checks. As for the liberal thing... Beats me where you pulled that one from. EDIT: saw your reply to Klark below. LOLZ. Dundun Dundun Why are they doing this at all? Things were fine before. Idiots will still believe what they want to believe and others will still check statements out, this much is non-partisan. None of this does anything except put things in favor of one political position. Guess which? But ultimately this will hurt Google, because in case they didn't get the memo, half of America hate the far left and its methods! And guess what this is? A horribly ham-fisted forcing of position, just like what happened before Trump was elected. This is the sort of thing that will kill Google. Nick Don't be so overly dramatic. DKBNYC Couple of things here. First, the internet is already censored. Always was. Second, " if multiple entities have fact-checked the information and arrived at differing conclusions." Then one of the conclusions is not a fact. Sir_Brizz Then who would decide which fact checker was the one with the correct facts? Klark Kenneth The 'who' certainly doesn't include Google; it's not Google's job here. They're merely providing the tag for what's already been done by others. Sir_Brizz I'm not really arguing that point, but this label doesn't really deal with conflicting "fact checks". Max Johnson That whole election ordeal made me switch to DuckDuckGo. M. Luciano What is "that whole election ordeal"? Vilmar When people typed a "Hillary Clinton/Trump is a" and got quick suggestion based on what people searched for most, some decided this was Google manipulating things. M. Luciano So relevant and personalized search results? DKBNYC No, lies and Russian propaganda. M. Luciano "and got quick suggestion based on what people searched for most" is what the commentor said. That's how all of Google's autofill works. It tries to predict what you're searching for based on both your search history and on the most common searches for people typing the same thing and with similar search histories to your own. That's relevant and personalized search results. What is it that you're talking about that they were not talking about? DKBNYC Sounds like it keeps people closed minded to me. M. Luciano How so? Vivek Rameses This is the most ridiculous bullshit ever. I'm surprised their fan base hasn't dropped significantly. M. Luciano What is ridiculous about it and what do you think their "fans", or users, wouldn't like about it? Nogib Except that the third party sites they are using for their *cough* "fact checking" are literally so neck deep in their own political biases that it isn't even funny. Objective is not a word one could use to describe this alleged fact checking. M. Luciano Guess that's why there are 115 organizations and a thorough screening process - to eliminate any perceived bias. But just curious, what exactly are you referring to? pfmiller People who don't like the truth always get butthurt over fact checking. Devin Rodriguez Politifact finds this argument to be mostly true. Ken Mitchell Politfact also assures us that Syria has no more chemical weapons, so I guess those dead babies are mythical. M. Luciano Link to that? Devin Rodriguez I think he didn't quite understand my sarcasm. Mine was the good kind, his was just mean. Sir_Brizz You mean this? http://www.politifactbias.com/2017/04/politifact-fixes-fact-check-on-syrian.html M. Luciano I may be missing something, but looks like they *may have* made a mistake and another blog doesn't like how they updated on the situation. Even the blog notes that the information may have been correct and just out of date, since it's an article that's 2-3 years old and new things could have transpired in that period. Something being probably true in 2014, when commenting on the current political state of events, can't be expected to be permanently true, right? Or is there another angle to this that we should be discussing? Sir_Brizz The blog is pointing out how PolitiFact doesn't treat mistakes properly. I don't think they were necessarily trying to say there was anything wrong with the initial conclusion they came to (although the lack of actual facts should have been a giveaway that they didn't know), but they didn't handle updating the fact check in a transparent or open way at all. takpro So, It's your assertion that all the chemical weapons were gone in 2014, but somehow returned in 2017 without notice? Accum's Razor: It's more likely they were always there. The people that assured the American public that they were gone, were wrong...at best. M. Luciano Oh no, that's not my assertion at all. I said that a long time had passed in a war zone and it's possible things changed. I don't see this example as an organization intentionally misleading their audience. But I have no idea whatsoever if they were correct or not in 2014. USCanthony You do realize that you are linking to a website that exists simply to hate Politifact. The person or persons that started and maintain this blog believe that Politifact is very biased which is why Politifact is always stating that the things they believe are untrue.That in itself is extreme bias on the part of the people who run that blog and therefore you cannot take anything you read there with a grain of salt. Sir_Brizz You realize you are dismissing a site that is critical of PolitiFact just because they clearly state they are critical of PolitiFact. Fact checkers need people to keep them honest. They are not above reproach. Also, that blog does not claim that everything PolitiFact says or does is wrong. In the post in question, please let me know how the reasoning of the author is wrong. USCanthony I am actually stating that you cannot provide proof of bias on Politifacts part when that proof is a link to a website that has a reputation for having an anti-politifact bias. I was not questioning whether politifact themselves had any bias. It is very difficult to be 100% unbiased at all times and I have no doubt that at times Politifact may have come across as being biased but as a whole, they do a pretty good job of being balanced. They stick to the provable facts (information that has supporting empirical data from multiple sources) but sometimes their delivery of those facts comes across wrong. They have also been incorrect every now and then but that had more to do with what was thought to be proven facts was actually a ruse or scam that even multiple news outlets were suckered in with. That happens sometimes and it is usually a very sophisticated and targeted attempt to change a narrative that succeeds in fooling professional news organizations. When that happens though, people need to keep in mind that the news organization was not trying to deceive the public or purposely mislead with a false narrative. They believed that the data they had gathered was correct. They vetted and verified that data with multiple sources and it passed all of their vetting without any red flags popping up. They thought they were presenting a factual story/arguement. Unfortunately they were victims to a very sophisticated operation to spin an alternate narrative and they did not realize this until much later. That doesn't make them dishonest though. They truly believed what they had reported. It sometimes looks like they are very biased though because the majority of their fact checking has not gone in favor of the GOP' Sir_Brizz "you cannot provide proof of bias on Politifacts part when that proof is a link to a website that has a reputation for having an anti-politifact bias" This is wrong. The proof of PolitiFact bias is present in the content of the post you refuse to even read or critique. If you think it is wrong, why? It's laughable that you think PolitiFact (or any other fact checker) stick to "provable facts". Many of the fact checks rely heavily on what people say as fact and ignore what is actually happening. That fact check was no different. As I said above, I don't even necessarily think it was that bad for them to have posted the original article (although they had no real evidence to come up with their rollup score, which is just more proof that the rollup scores are stupid), what's worse is how they corrected it when new information was presented. USCanthony Who said I did not read that post? I read it and it was exactly what I expected it to be based on the reputation of that blog. The person or people who run that blog feel that fact checking sites spin the facts to support a far left agenda. It is a veiled conspiracy theory way of thinking. By the way, I did not say that any fact checking site completely sticks to provable facts. I purposely got a bit verbose because I was trying to make it clear that fact checking sites don't always get it right. Sometimes what looks like indisputable facts turns out to be a very good scam or con and even professional journalists fall victims to a good scam sometimes. The point I was trying to make it that they do not purposely disseminate information that they know is incorrect. Professional journalists take their jobs very seriously and they are aware of the tremendous responsibility they have to get it right. Unfortunately more and more people are buying the false narrative that the Trump campaign and now his administration has been spewing forth about how the media is so crooked and how they do not report the truth. As with 80% of everything that comes out of Trumpland, those statements are purposeful lies that are intended to destroy the public's confidence in the free press. The Trump administration cannot afford to have the majority of Americans believing what is being reported in newspapers and on news shows. But see....it does work that way....facts are the facts. The isn't such a thing as alternate facts or a differing viewpoint that makes the same set of facts mean something entirely different. Alternate facts are better known as lies and the ability for two groups of people to read the exact same set of facts and walk away with entirely different ideas of what those facts were proving is a sure sign of ideology overriding common sense. For the most part the fact checking sites do get it right and it is not hard to verify that because if people just take the time to cross reference the data they will find all sorts of supporting and corroborating information. But for those people that are so mired in their ideological beliefs, that the obvious truth/facts of a story if the story does not support their ideological viewpoint simply cannot and will not accept those facts as actual real facts. To do so would destroy most of their long held belief's and would force them to question their own values. They are simply not going to do that. Sir_Brizz You can bluster all you want, but please refute that post if you think that they were wrongly critical. Every person on this Earth has ideological beliefs. Fact checkers are not immune from what you're talking about and couldn't be even if they tried. That's exactly why it's easy to slant a fact check. Additionally, they will get anyone that agrees with them ideologically defending their ability to neutrally fact check. It doesn't take a high IQ to realize that there is no such thing as a neutral fact check. There are lots of wrong fact checks, there is a lack of transparency and openness in the fact check I dustry, and fact checkers consistently fail to either have a policy for.corrections or stick to the policies they do have. You can't have faith in fact checking just because they try to do their best. How would that be any different than just trusting the media outlets? It wouldn't be. USCanthony I am hardly blustering. I am telling you what you cannot admit to yourself. I have taken journalism in college. I have a good understanding of the ethics that good journalists try to hold themselves up too. I also understand that anyone can spin a story too meet their own ideological viewpoint. I do not think you understand that though because you are completely missing the fact that this is what you are doing. I also do not think that you have any understanding of journalism and the standards that ethical journalists strive to hold themselves up to on a daily basis. Just look at the winners of the Pulitzer prize this year. Some of them are the very individuals that our current President has tried to paint as dishonest and biased. He does not understand journalism either. Of course he understands very little. vwnut13 "If you want to fact check, just visit hillaryclinton.com!" - Hillary Clinton Sir_Brizz I know this was meant to be a joke, but the fact checking sites generally do use people's own words as evidence in whatever they are fact checking as if words = action.

For example , Bruce Jenner "identifies" as a woman and Rachel Dolezal "identifies" with being black. How will this algorithm account for that considering some people in the media defend this practice of insanity? M. Luciano A falsifiable claim is either true or it isn't. People's interpretation of it or even ability to discover whether or not it is definitely true or false does not impact the truth of the claim itself. So "Is Rachel Dolezal black" might have a definite yes or no answer and, if it does, whether or not you or I agree with that answer does not actually change the answer. 4Ui812 Tillerson pointedly said the United States did not discuss the military strike with Russian President Vladimir Putin or the Russian political leadership in Moscow either before or after it occurred. But the U.S. military said it communicated with the Russian military to minimize any chance of Russian casualties -- in particular Russians operating out of the targeted airfield. This paragraph here contains truth, spin and while technically not a lie a lie all the same. How would a fact checker rank this? Deductive reasoning is why I said it's a lie all the same. Bruce Wayne That makes no sense. Of course it doesn't change the answer but it's still false. M. Luciano I don't know who she is to know if it's yes or no, but it's definitely one or the other unless she's partial, then that's pretty much yes. Sir_Brizz You should read up on her then? She was in charge of the NAACP until it was learned that she had no black heritage whatsoever and was misrepresenting herself as black. This week, she stated that she identifies herself as "trans-black". M. Luciano I'm not a psychiatrist but I'm not sure that's a thing one can be. Sir_Brizz You don't have to tell me twice. Ken Mitchell "A falsifiable claim is either true or it isn't. " Politifact, one of Google's Anointed Ones, rates as "True" the John Kerry claim that Syria destroyed all of their chemical weapons. And yet, there are STILL dead babies on the ground. Dundun Dundun Jesus Christ you're an idiot, no wonder the world is doomed. M. Luciano All of this stuff is many days old. You're late to your trolling party. Feel free to go troll other people. Hopefully you can read well enough to understand this post, because you clearly haven't been able to understand any of the posts of mine that you've quoted. Dundun Dundun Hah! No I understood your posts quite well, you were defending Google for some weird reason. Look through the thread, you reply to everyone, my replying to you several times shouldn't bother you? I also like how you respond to this one but not my other comments. If you can't take it, don't dish it out. Peace out. Dundun Dundun Ah, I was just being nasty. I don't think you're an idiot. That's some good patronizin' though. Enjoy policing the comments round here, not sure why people put up with it though. Vorastra The irony... something_new This will not work. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People debate the definition of censorship. Jason so google wants to "give users the ability to make informed decisions for themselves." by taking away the need to make an informed decision FOR YOURSELF!!! so we started with facts. but some facts werent facts so we needed to fact check. and now we have fact checked facts. of course fact checked facts may contradict each other. but thats because we want you to check the fact checking of the facts and then decide for yourself if it is in fact fact. got it? Vivek Rameses Just more reasons to not use this shitty company. Ken Mitchell Neither PolitiFact nor Snopes are reliable thought-police; both are pretty far left. Politifact, for example, rated John Kerry's assurances that Syria had NO chemical weapons as "Mostly true". Tell that to the dead babies. M. Luciano Just read what another poster linked about this. In 2014 they thought it was probably true. Are they expected to be psychic and predict what may happen 2-3 years later? Sir_Brizz If they are actually fact checking, then the lack of information should not lead to anything other than an "unknown" result. Imparus Wrong, every law in physics is based on only being "mostly true" until we find something that get closer to the truth, from your logic we should never have any laws to describe things that happens, since nothing can actually be proven with a 100% certainty Bruce Wayne Like I would ever trust a far left liberal company like Google to provide accurate fact checking. M. Luciano Luckily, they're not checking facts. They're providing links to others with qualifications to do so when they have done so. Also, Google isn't really liberal. Sir_Brizz Unluckily, the organizations they are trusting are not any less liberal than they are. For this system to be as neutral as it can be, they should find fact checks by multiple sources with differing conclusions and political leanings and present them all. However, this minor change alone really made Search UX an utter mess so adding even more info isn't a great idea. M. Luciano Neutrality, especially politically, is not a valid goal of journalism. Objectivity is. So what is true matters, not whose narrative is served by it. Sir_Brizz Is fact checking journalism? If it is, they are doing it wrong. If it's not, they are doing it wrong. In the case of fact checking, objectivity should equal neutrality. vwnut13 Politifact and Snopes... LMAO! Kurt Schultz "[...] a method for publishers in certain countries to display a "Fact Check" tag next to their content in Search and News results" So publishers get to mark their own content as fact checked? That makes absolutely no sense! StopBeingOffendedDERP Right...from a company that has ties to US intelligence agencies. Sure. MANOJ Is this kind of censorship essential for Google ? Techngro 'This signifies that the article had been verified as true by news and fact-checking organizations." It depends on what the meaning of the word 'as' is. But seriously, does anyone still trust that 'news organizations' don't twist the information that they report and 'fact check' to suit their own biases? Laurajjeske Google is paying $97 per hour!

Matein Khalid/Dubai Filed on April 16, 2017 | Last updated on April 16, 2017 at 08.40 pm Share More > Vote Jack Ma owns the most attractive e-commerce platform in the world other than Amazon.com. (AFP) Digital/mobile advertising growth rates beginning to accelerate and are a fabulous money-maker Even as Amazon, Google and Facebook's meteoric rise mesmerise Silicon Valley and Wall Street, I am awed by the hyper-growth potential of the global e-commerce industry, demonstrated by Amazon's takeover of Souq.com after a bidding war with Emaar Malls. The mobile Internet and social media (800 million active users on Tencent's WeChat messaging platform in China!) are game-changers, as are mobile wallets such as Alipay in China, MercadoPago in Brazil or Paytm in India have created payment solutions for emerging markets. Digital/mobile advertising growth rates have begun to accelerate and are a fabulous money-maker for a handful of Internet companies form the emerging markets listed on the New York Stock Exchange. India, China, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico and Vietnam alone could add one billion more smartphone users in the next four years. China alone boasts 750 million smartphone users, half the population of the Middle Kingdom, even now. E-commerce by far superior to China's fragmented, archaic, expensive and limited-range brick-and-mortar retail industry. Alibaba is unquestionably the most attractive e-commerce platform in the world other than Amazon.com. I talked to a buy side e-commerce analyst in the Bay Area who estimates that Alibaba's move to e-commerce/B2B market place platform is worth at least $110 a share Ant Financial is worth at least $8, Ali Cloud is worth $16, Digital Media and net cash is $5. This valuation paradigm suggests Alibaba shares could be valued by the stock market at $140. The Graham and Dodd deep-value DNA is my investment soul thus likes Alibaba below $100 a share, given its 35 per cent rise in the past 12 months. The SEC investigations into Alibaba's accounting will have an impact on the share price, which could be a buying opportunity for investors who share my valuation paradigm. Alibaba could well earn $4.50 in 2018. So one of history's most unique shares trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of only 22 times even though it can well deliver compound annual growth rate of 25-27 per cent in the next five years, powered by mobile, cloud and rural China hypergrowth. True, Jack Ma has eroded his credibility by spending billions in non-core areas, Chinese consumer growth could well be derailed by a property bubble collapse and potential SEC black swan mean downside risk to $80 a share. Baidu has been a Cinderella compared to Alibaba, Tencent Holdings and Ctrip, stellar performers in the past six months. Despite the 100 per cent revenue growth rates in its iQiyi video portal, Baidu is expensive at 30 times earnings and trades at an unjustified valuation premium to Alibaba, despite a far less diversified business model more vulnerable to the Great Firewall of China. I would only reconsider Baidu's ADR if the shares fell below $150. Russia's Yandex has risen 30 per cent from its early-2016 lows. Yandex is Russia's Google, with an unassailable market share in search/digital advertising on the Cyrillic Internet. Yandex is the most popular search engine in Russia and has a footprint in nine ex-USSR countries. Yandex shares still trade below its May 2011 IPO price of $25, a victim of Russia's financial trauma after the Kremlin invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014 and the Russian economy, handcuffed by Western sanctions, slipped into recession. For now, I expect Yandex to range trade at 18-24. South Korean technology conglomerate Samsung Electronics is not an e-commerce or Internet media stock but its critical role in the global smartphone component and semiconductor markets makes it impossible to ignore for an investor in emerging markets. Samsung shares have risen 60 per cent in the past year, despite the political crises like the arrests of both the now-former South Korean president and Samsung's vice-chairman/dynastic heir apparent Jay Y. Lee for corruption. Samsung still trades at nine times forward earnings, despite its spectacular stock market performance in 2016-17 due to its fabulous earnings growth, strong free cash flow and rising dividend payouts. Samsung also contributes 25 per cent of the GDP of Asia's most "broadband wired" society, making it the epicentre of one of global technology's most powerful and innovative ecosystems. There is no doubt in my mind that Asia's preeminent high-technology conglomerate will command a higher valuation multiple if corporate governance and shareholder payouts standard improve.

Plantronics BackBeat 500 review: Budget headphones have a new challenger Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 5:00am PDTApr 14, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 19 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares63 Audio Reviews News Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 PLT Allthethings! 4 Design and controls 5 Comfort and usability 6 Sound quality 7 Great starter headphones I am not an on-ear headphones person so it's difficult for me to review them objectively without saying how much I dislike the idea and pressure they exert on my ears. Oddly, that's not the case with the BackBeat 500, the newest release from Plantronics. I don't hate them and I can manage wearing them for a couple of hours without wanting to rip them off my head. That's a good start. I've reviewed many of the brand's headphones over the years including the in-ear BackBeat GO 3 and the big over-ear BackBeat Pro+ and Pro 2, and I've spent some time with the on-ear BackBeat Sense, so I do know what to expect: better value for the money than most brands, good sound quality, and nice design and build. The BackBeat 500 fit right in with that trend so let's take a more in-depth look at them. The Good Comfort For on-ear headphones, these are actually nice to wear and don't force themselves on your ears. The memory foam in the cushions and headband probably play a role in that. Battery life With 18 hours of battery life and 6 months of hibernation, these can rock you continuously through a long day or a few hours per day every week. No need to worry about turning them off either. Multipoint Bluetooth and wired listening You can use the 3.5mm plug to listen in wired mode or Bluetooth for wireless. They can also connect to 2 Bluetooth devices simultaneously. Sound It's more than decent given the on-ear design and affordable price. Price For $79.95, you get a really nice starter headset with many things done right. The Not So Good Branding I count 5 visible instances of "Plantronics" or "PLT" on the headphones. Is this product subsidized by the free advertising it generates? On-ear design Not everyone is a fan. If given the choice, I'd go for over-ear anytime, so make sure you don't mind that before buying them. Size It's small, but doesn't bend to be more easily stored. Only the earcups twist to be flat. PLT Allthethings! I rarely notice and even more rarely get annoyed by branding on products, even if they're on the face of a smartwatch, but the BackBeat 500 surprised me and not in a positive way. The headset has so much product branding that you start wondering if its affordable price is subsidized by the free publicity you do while wearing it. The word Plantronics is on the bottom of both sides of the headband, the acronym PLT is in big on the top of the headband and the face of the right ear cup, and there's an orange fabric sticking out of the headband with PLT on one side and Plantronics on the other. That's too much, seriously. I'm not even counting the Plantronics on the inside of the headband with the IC certification and model plus serial number. Above: "PLT" orange fabric, white "Plantronics" on the headband, black "PLT" on the earcup. Below: Large black "PLT" and small white "Plantronics" on the headband. Most of these are subtle and I probably would have found they added flair to the headset (I especially like the large PLT on the top of the headband), if it weren't for the orange fabric sticking out like a cheap clothing tag. That's the one that tipped me over the edge and got me to see all the others in a worse light. Why? It's not traditional for me to start a review with a negative point, but in this case I had to because some users will be irked by the overzealous branding and thus never ever consider the BackBeat 500. For those who aren't bothered by it or who can grow to ignore it (like me), then these are very nice on-ear headphones and try as I might, I couldn't really fault them at anything else for the price. Design and controls The BackBeat 500 is solidly built with thick mostly matte plastic, soft faux-leather, and clean finishes. It looks clean too, especially in the dark grey and black color that I have. There's a bright white and light grey version and another dark grey and green one that is super cool. In almost all-black though, the headset appears understated. The most remarkable thing about it are the sharp angles that the headband takes when curving toward the earcup, and even those aren't that distinguishable. Despite the two sharp edges on the headband, the design is very understated. Being an on-ear headset, the earcups are tiny and the overall size and weight is considerably reduced compared to over-ear sets like the Bose QC35 pictured below for comparison. The right earcup houses the Power + Bluetooth toggle that turns the 500 off, on, and puts them into pairing mode. There's a small LED light nearby that momentarily switches to blue when they're on and red when they're off, and hops between both when pairing. And there's a large call button that can redial with a double click or launch Google Assistant (or OK Google) with a long click. Right earcup: Power/Bluetooth pairing button, LED light, and call/Google Assistant button. The controls and ports are on the left earcup: MicroUSB for charging, 3.5mm for wired listening, Volume up and down, and Play/Pause, skip, and rewind. Left earcup: Ports and playback controls. The buttons and switches are all very clicky and the playback controls are easy to feel thanks to their embossed symbols. When other and more expensive headsets skimp on buttons and double the volume controls as skip and rewind, it's nice to see they are separate here, resulting in less confusion and simpler usage. Comfort and usability For a pair of on-ear headphones, the BackBeat 500 are surprisingly comfortable to wear. I've been able to keep them on for a couple of hours without wanting to rip them off my head, which is a change from many other sets I've tried before; even Plantronics' own Sense was too annoying for me to keep for more than 10-15 minutes. At 155g, these are very light and thanks to the memory foam on the inside of the headband and the earcups, they sit softly on your head and ears. The headband is flexible and not too tight so it doesn't exert too much pressure on your head while you're wearing it. And as with any headphones, you can extend the headband by several levels on each side to adjust to the size of your head. I found the mechanism very solid and once it sets on a level, it doesn't budge unless you exert enough pressure on it. Headband memory foam (left) and extendability (right). Beside being comfortable to wear, the BackBeat 500 up their usability thanks to two features. One, Multipoint Bluetooth lets me connect them to my phone and my iMac at the same time, so I can enjoy music from the desktop and take phone calls without having to take off the headset. Two, the long battery life and standby capability mean that I don't have to charge them often and I don't even have to worry about leaving them unadvertentyly on. As an anecdotal case, I left the BackBeat 500 with the toggle on for an entire weekend at work and when I came back on Monday, I thought I'd have to charge them to be able to test them. Turns out they had kicked into standby mode and hadn't lost any significant amount of battery. Sweet! Compared to Plantronics' other headphones that I've reviewed, these have the least options. There's no sensor to automatically pause and resume playback when you put them on, no NFC for easy pairing, and no OpenMic to hear your surroundings with a quick click without pausing the music. If corners had to be cut to keep the price down, those were the right ones to ditch. They're very cool features, but not essential ones. Sound quality I wasn't expecting much from an $80 pair of on-ear headphones, but like many of Plantronics' other models, they pack a lot of bang for your buck. Although the on-ear design typically shouldn't seal the earcups tightly, causing sound to escape in and out, that's not the case here. With the music near 80% volume, my friend sitting near me can't hear a thing. And at an even lower 50-60% volume, I feel outside noise and speech being relatively blocked from reaching me. Okay so we're nowhere near real noise cancelation and zero sound leak, but it's pretty darn impressive for a small on-ear headset. I'm sure the memory foam around the earcups plays a significant role in reducing leakage, even if they're just resting on your ear and not around it, and having the same 40mm dynamic drivers as the BackBeat Pro 2 helps with the quality of the sound. Speaking of, the sound is warm, rather balanced, with a slightly heavier preference for bass, though without too much sacrifice on the mids and highs. The lows and highs at the beginning of Loic Nottet's Rythm Inside resonate accurately even at the highest volume and when vocals are added to the mix, there's no muddying and a great surrounding feel from the music. You get the same clarity and engulfing sound in Imagine Dragons' Believer and Fall Out Boy's Centuries. And you can sharply hear the notes ring at the beginning of Occidentali's Karma while still enjoying the subtleties of Francesco Gabbani's raspy voice on top. The heavier focus on bass won't be obvious all the time, but it's there. The beats in The Weeknd's Starboy feel a little more overpowering compared to the rest of the music, but I'm pretty sure this is exactly what anyone hearing that song expects. I have one picky thing to point out though. Rock/Pop tracks with clear background music and average rhythms where there's less chance of overlapping notes play well, but I found faster and heavier rock tracks to be more confusing on the BackBeat 500. When the chorus kicks in in Three Days Grace's I Am Machine, I kept feeling like everything was being more jumbled than I'd like, and the same happened with Halestorm's I Miss The Misery and Minus-One's Cold. It's a small annoyance but those with fast and heavy rock preferences might want to look elsewhere. However, I keep telling myself that anyone picky enough to notice this wouldn't and shouldn't be looking at an $80 pair of on-ear headphones, so that's why I didn't even point this out in the negatives at the top of the review. When all is said and done, the sound you're getting here is more immersive and powerful than you'd expect with little distortion and just a bit more focus on bass. If your tastes veer toward pop, electronic, RnB, latin, and the more subtle rock songs, then you're in the clear. Great starter headphones If you can't afford the larger, more powerful, and more comfortable over-ear headphones, the market for on-ear headphones will drown you with dozens upon dozens of options. But the BackBeat 500 comes in as a heavy contender in the category, packing as much oomph as it can for the price. Solid build, clean finishes, comfortable wear, and great battery life make this one of the most attractive options you can consider, if you can look past all the branding on the headset. The sound quality, good seal, and little sound leak, are where the BackBeat 500 shines. For $80, you're getting what you pay for and even some.

I'll write this model to watch it's price falling for the next year's. Justin W It definitely depends on the country, but given they're wireless and a decent pair of those goes for $120-$200, this would fall pretty well into the budget range in my opinion. Sure, you can get those cheap $20-30 ones on Amazon, but those are just horrid in my experience. Thalles Ferreira Yeah, but 120-200 you can even buy a budget smartphone (with its own limitations for being budget, of course), 30 bucks barely brings you a dumbphone, that's why I was talking... The experience between 30 and 200 is very different, sure, but as from 600$ and 120$ phones. Derik Taylor This seems like a good set of headphones to keep at my desk at work. Rita El Khoury That's where I'm keeping these. They'll come handy when I want to focus on a long post and block a bit the distractions. iKon Saw the title and thought they would be around £20.... Guess not. matteventu I have the first BackBeat Pro model and they're awesome. Also the "special features" are something that you can't live without after getting used to it. crutchcorn Guys, I hate to say it, but ~$30 isn't budget here in the states (or even Europe for that matter). These are absolutely budget, given how many of these bluetooth headphones go well above the pricetag of $150. I myself bought a pair of wired headphones for $200 a year or two ago and I'd consider what I have fairly budget friendly, to be frank. It's all a matter of quality and what you're looking for; and given the field there are in, I'd say they're very budget NooSH i have to agree with everyone else Rita , $80 may be budget for people that can afford it or audiophiles , but for us casual users, $80 is premium status. but i like the review , glad you did it ..i would of saved up for them had they been over-ear .. even though i like those pads over the standard "leather" ones , on-ear hurts over a short period of time and my ears can only take so much pain lol. Marti Abernathey Nope. You being cheap doesn't move these into a premium category. If i don't like paying over $500 for a handset, that doesn't magically change the 3t from a budget handset into a premium one. Impulse_Vigil Ehh, I'd say anything < $100 is budget priced too, $50 is like bargain bin heh... There's not a lot of stuff I'd recommend at or under $50, and definitely not with BT etc... There's the Creative Aurvana Live (first version not 2nd), and uhh... Koss KSC75? They're clip ons tho. I'm not being snobbish, I have headphones ranging from $20 to $400 and I've spent a grand on an amp for me better ones (ironically HD600 I got for $250...), and I enjoy them all. If you're really that cash strapped just stick with IEM, you'll get more for your $. Xiaomi Piston 2/3 are pretty great for <$20 and have Android compatible volume controls, still a rarity.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Huawei Reportedly Started Internal Testing of Android O on the Mate 9 By Zara Ali Apr 12, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Google released Android O Developer Preview, last month, to give developers the platform to test their apps and services before the final version goes live. However, it seems like Chinese manufacturer, Huawei has taken up this opportunity to test Android O on its Huawei Mate 9 smartphone. The report comes from XDA Developers forums, which has spotted an image of Huawei Mate 9 running Android O. Going by the report, it looks like some senior member on the XDA forum has got the access to test internal build of Android O on Huawei’s Mate 9 phone. Related Android O Improves User Privacy by Using Random Address for Wi-Fi Scanning & Limiting Device Identifiers Regarding Android O’s performance on the Mate 9, XDA wrote: Advertisement There are a few new things in the build such as a new files app and new developer options. But it is missing all language options apart from Chinese (Mandarin) and English and also does not feature a System Update app or eRecovery. XDA has not revealed the name of the users who posted the images, but it did try to authenticate if the pictures are real or not. The folks at XDA, requested the uploader to share a photo of “About Page” of Android O running Huawei Mate 9 along with an image of the “Picture-in-Picture mode” in action. The uploader supplied the images asked by XDA, which somewhat authenticates the claim. Android O features like picture in picture seem to be working on the Mate 9. Related Huawei Honor 8 Pro Is a Premium Phone With a Dual-Camera and Everything You Want From a Top-Notch High-End Phone Android O on Huawei Mate 9: Images There are fair chances that someone internally linked with Huawei has deliberately posted these images to show how Huawei has already started testing Android O on the Mate 9. If all this is happening at Huawei, then we can expect the manufacturer to deliver Android O update faster than other makers. However, we do have our fair share of doubt as Huawei has never made it to the list of manufacturers who push quick updates. The ROM used for the Mate 9 comes pre-rooted with SELinux set to permissive and it entails several issues that are not suitable for daily drivers. Anyway, Huawei has not yet spoken on the alleged images of the Mate 9. Also, Android O first needs to be completed by Google. The tech giant has not even revealed what the “O” stands for, yet. Oreo, anyone?

When the Nexus 6P debuted, it was lauded for its big size display and collection of hardware and features at a serviceable price point. It even earned our Editor's Choice award during our own evaluation. Fast forward to today and unfortunately the same handset is now drawing criticism by some users who are experiencing shutdown problems. There are enough users having trouble with the Nexus 6P that Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating a potential class-action lawsuit against Google. According to user complaints cited by the law firm, consumers are reporting a battery issue that causes the phone to power down when the battery gauge still shows anywhere from 10-60 percent of battery life remaining. Some reports suggest it's a bug in Android 7.0 Nougat, but even after flashing back to Android 6.0 Marshmallow, affected users say the problem persists. "Although Google has assigned the issue in its tracker, the problem has been given low priority and there is no indication of an incoming fix. Reports indicate that consumers who have attempted to receive warranty service from Huawei—the phone manufacturer—have been turned away, with Huawei telling them the problem is not the phone or the battery, but instead it is a problem with Google’s software," the law firm states. Yet other Nexus 6P owners are complaining that their handsets are getting stuck in a boot loop, where the phone continually restarts without ever fully booting into Android. This happens until the battery runs dry. Even wiping the phone's memory and reflashing Android doesn't seem to fix the issue. The law firm says that points to a hardware issue, not a software one. If all of this sounds familiar, it is because LG is also facing class-action lawsuit for similar issues related to its G4 and V10 handsets. LG actually admitted to a problem with its G4 handsets a little over a year ago, blaming the problem on a "loose contact between components," but never issued a recall or a satisfactory remedy to affected owners.

Vanessa Marcotte, 27, fought back against her attacker and left him with bruises, scratches and cuts during the ordeal. Now eight months after the brutal killing, DNA samples from the woman's hands have matched with prime suspect Angel Colon-Ortiz. Vanessa, who worked as an account manager for Google, was murdered in August last year when she went for a jog near her mum's home in Massachusetts, US. Her naked body was found that night in woodland half a mile away after she had been sexually assaulted and killed. Colon-Ortiz, 31, was arrested on Good Friday after being spotted by a state trooper who believed he matched the killer's description. Worcester County district attorney Joseph Early Jr told a press conference: "We got him. This has been a rollercoaster all along."

After the suspect was arrested, his DNA was tested against samples from Vanessa's hands and a positive match was recorded. "We’re very confident we have Vanessa Marcotte’s killer," Mr Early added, according to Fox News . Police believe Vanessa was killed between 1pm and 3pm on August 7 - shortly before she was due to travel from Massachusetts to New York. Her death sparked fears of a serial killer on the loose. Vanessa pictured on a beach trip (Photo: Instagram/v_marcotte) Karina Vetrano, 30, was sexually assaulted and murdered while out running in Queens, New York, just days earlier. NYPD spokesman Peter Donald said at the time: "We haven’t ruled anything out. We’re going to continue to investigate this case and follow the leads where they take us." Google said in a statement after Vanessa's death: "Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half - and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports. "We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends."

But first, a little bit of history. When the Market was released, all reviews were sorted in a natural reverse chronological order. At some point later, Google changed the sort to float most helpful reviews to the top (whatever that algorithm may be), which infuriated many as now old and oftentimes irrelevant reviews showed up above newer, more useful ones. Today, we, the users, can finally sort reviews any way we see fit: newest rating helpfulness Yay! Now if we could only filter by version number... can we have that next, Google? Pretty please? Oh yeah, and any chance of the same in the device Market? Tags Android helpfulness market newest order rating review sort update user subscribe ...

Jim About effing time! dubqnp /me 'Sorts comments on androidpolice by helpfulness' ;) bounce games We all know the story. China and Google don’t get along. The world’s most populous nation and the internet’s largest entity don’t see eye to eye on fundamental issues such as access to information and freedom of expression. The tenuous relationship has led to the ban of a number of Google products in China over the years, and the Android Market is only the latest to see a country-wide ban. Access to market.android.com from within China is denied across five major provinces, blocking smartphone users from accessing and downloading applications from the portal. hillbilliegreg Good, I wish they would block all apps from china BobB I am using version 3.1.5 and I can't figure out how to get to the "Sort by" setting pictured above.

Richie The race to develop self-driving cars is on with big players like Google, Uber and Tesla in the game. But a lesser-known Atlanta based company, Wheego Technologies, is also poised to compete. Lead by Mike McQuary, CEO and former President of MindSpring/EarthLink, Wheego’s team works on emerging vehicle technologies in artificial intelligence/machine learning, self-driving vehicles, and connected devices for home, business and roadway. “I want the best and the brightest to know that there is a company right here in Atlanta that is going to help change the world for the better,” McQuary said. Atlanta is the headquarters for Wheego’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) development team while all electric vehicle (EV) and automotive work is done in Sonoma, CA.  McQuary founded the company in 2008, originally named Wheego Electric Cars Inc., to produce small EVs. Its Wheego LiFe sold 400 cars in the U.S., but in 2014, Wheego decided to switch gears and focus on autonomous vehicle development rather than EV production. “Continuing to make and sell EV’s would require a lot of capital without a defensible competitive advantage in the long run,” McQuary explained. “However, I believe we are one of the best in the world at creating an AI platform that will deliver products to change people’s lives.” With this change came a new name – Wheego Technologies, Inc. – and a team of industry experts in AI, networked communications and autonomous driving technologies. “We have created an AI platform and our first product is an Advanced Driver Assistance System. The highest level of which is self-driving cars. It is one of the greatest challenges for AI because of the complexity of recognizing all of the stimuli in the environment around a vehicle that is moving and translating it all into driving maneuvers that are safe,” McQuary said. Mike McQuary Last fall, the California Department of Motor Vehicles awarded Wheego a permit to test its autonomous systems on public roads in California. It can run tests with a single vehicle and four drivers. When will self-driving cars reach Atlanta? McQuary is optimistic that the promise of alleviating traffic congestion will motivate our city and state government to support these technological advances. “The City of Atlanta is being very ambitious in their desire to test this technology and the state of Georgia is also showing early signs of legislative support for autonomous cars,” he said. McQuary is using the same foresight that lead him to create MindSpring (which later merged with EarthLink) more than 20 years ago. The extremely successful Internet business had more than 5 million subscribers and 5,000 employees. “AI in 20 years will be woven into the fabric of our lives as the Internet is today. A very near term simple example: your AI system knows that you set your alarm for 6:30 a.m. to wake and take your kids to school and get to the office on time. It realizes on a particular day that a traffic accident has occurred and it changes your alarm to wake you up 30 minutes earlier so you can still make your itinerary on time,” McQuary said. For this entrepreneur, lessons learned at MindSpring will propel Wheego forward in a very competitive environment. Namely, how a company “treats their customers, employees, and investors, provides a real and meaningful competitive differentiation. That small smart companies can beat large corporations. That the best and the brightest coming out of college want to work where they can make a difference and change the world.” by collin Website Related Posts Theatre Review: 'Hamle… By Manning Harris fmanningh@gmail.com “Poem Unlimited”:  That’s… Tasting Intown: A revi… By Megan Volpert For the last 10… Report: Two killed in … A young child and a woman were… Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Vanessa Marcotte, 27, fought back against her attacker and left him with bruises, scratches and cuts. Now eight months after the brutal killing, DNA samples from her hands have matched with prime suspect Angel Colon-Ortiz. Vanessa, who worked as an account manager for Google, was murdered in August last year when she went for a jog near her mum's home in Massachusetts, US. Her naked body was found that night in woodland half a mile away after she had been sexually assaulted and killed.

Worcester County district attorney Joseph Early Jr told a press conference: "We got him. This has been a rollercoaster all along." He said Colon-Ortiz will now face charges of aggravated assault, aggravated battery, assault with intent to rape and murder, according to ABC News .

"We’re very confident we have Vanessa Marcotte’s killer," Mr Early added, according to Fox News . Police believe Vanessa was killed between 1pm and 3pm on August 7 - shortly before she was due to travel from Massachusetts to New York. Her death sparked fears of a serial killer on the loose.

While authorities still do not believe the two killings are linked, Mr Early said when asked again about the possibility of a serial killer: "We haven't ruled anything out."

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Patent suggests Microsoft’s CloudBook may focus on roaming profiles 1 by Surur  @mspoweruser Apr 16, 2017 at 13:00 GMT18 hours ago There is growing momentum behind the idea that Microsoft’s locked down Cloud OS would be targetted at the education environment and specifically be designed to take on Google’s successful Chrome Books. By restricting users to the Windows Store it should, like Chrome Books, vastly improve the safety and manageability of the devices, but so far we have not heard of a second major benefit of Chrome Books – that of being able to log into any device and have all your apps and files available automatically. Now a recently renewed patent by Microsoft filed in December 2016, suggests this feature will also be part of the OS. The patent for APPLICATION INSTALL AND LAYOUT SYNCING, “relate to synchronising configuration information between devices associated with a user. The synchronised configuration information can relate to application installations and uninstallations as well as to user modifications to user interfaces for managing and invoking the applications.” The patent notes “this description of inventive embodiments will begin with an overview of cloud-linked computing and computing devices used therefor” and continues to say “FIG. 1 shows an example of a multi-user multi-device cloud-oriented operating environment. Users may use or control respective sets of computing devices. Each user may have a user credential, user account, user identity, or some functional equivalent for distinguishing identity across computing devices forming and using a computing cloud. Account names, email accounts or addresses, and website accounts, are examples of user identities. Other information that can uniquely identify users can also serve as a user identity, such as a public key, a digitally signed certificate, a cookie, a hashtag, a biometric, etc. Such will be referred to as user identities. The computing devices or servers providing these services or resources may have infrastructure that coordinates and facilitates cooperation among the servers, for example, midware, clustering management, standby servers, data mirroring, virtual machine management, migration software, database engines, and so forth.   The account service manages the user identities 102 that are used within the cloud and on the user computing devices. The user identities might be stored in a table or the like…. Returning to FIG. 1, the account service may also track user computing devices in a table or data store of environment or device identifiers .” Windows of course long had the underpinnings of this technology, and since Windows 8 we have also been able to roam using our Microsoft Accounts. It is likely Windows 10 Cloud will take this one step further. Of note is that Windows 10 being abe to run on ARM would make the OS a drop-in replacement for Chrome OS, which is also available on both ARM and x86 devices. It is clear to me that for Microsoft to take on the very successful Google Chrome OS in the classroom they would need to be feature competitive, which means not just being locked down and secure, but also cloud-based and specific device agnostic. While current Windows 10 Cloud builds do not yet reveal these elements it is likely that we will hear much more details about the OS at Microsoft’s upcoming Education event on the 2nd May.

Vanessa Marcotte, 27, fought back against her attacker and left him with bruises, scratches and cuts. Now eight months after the brutal killing, DNA samples from her hands have matched with prime suspect Angel Colon-Ortiz. Vanessa, who worked as an account manager for Google, was murdered in August last year when she went for a jog near her mum's home in Massachusetts, US. Her naked body was found that night in woodland half a mile away after she had been sexually assaulted and killed.

Worcester County district attorney Joseph Early Jr told a press conference: "We got him. This has been a rollercoaster all along." He said Colon-Ortiz will now face charges of aggravated assault, aggravated battery, assault with intent to rape and murder, according to ABC News .

"We’re very confident we have Vanessa Marcotte’s killer," Mr Early added, according to Fox News . Police believe Vanessa was killed between 1pm and 3pm on August 7 - shortly before she was due to travel from Massachusetts to New York. Her death sparked fears of a serial killer on the loose.

While authorities still do not believe the two killings are linked, Mr Early said when asked again about the possibility of a serial killer: "We haven't ruled anything out."

"We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends."

YouTube app is testing another revamp that makes comments both more and less prominent Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/30 10:04pm PDTMar 30, 2017 40 Plus 1 on G+ 54 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Applications Google News Videos Out of all the Google apps that receive server-side changes, YouTube is one of the most prominent examples. It seems like YouTube is always experimenting with some sort of revamp, whether the changes are large or small. In this case, the changes are rather large; the comments section, which has been made a pop-up instead of a permanent part of the UI, now has an icon alongside the 'like' and 'dislike' functions. This test focuses entirely on the comments section, which is an integral (and sometimes dark) part of YouTube. Essentially, the comments are no longer a permanent piece of the interface; instead, it's now a pop-up that you open with a new comments button that sits next to the 'like,' 'dislike,' and 'share' icons. And by the way, that 'save' function is part of YouTube Red, not the test itself.      left two: old. right two: new. This seems like a fun video. The new comments icon also displays the number of comments that people have made; in the case of this "Little girl busted MythBusters" video, it's 368. It's also worth noting that if you have YouTube Red (which adds that additional 'save' button) and a small-enough DPI, you may get two rows of icons with a slick animation when you expand the video's title to read the description. See the embedded video above for an example of this.   left: old. right: new. Also, have elephants actually been confirmed for racists? You'll need to click that comments icon that you saw above to view the comments section with this change. Notice how in the screenshot of the current UI (the one on the left), you can scroll directly from the "What's New" section to the comments. That's not possible with the new comments interface; you have to enter comments by hitting that speech bubble icon. To exit, you press the 'x' on the top right of the pop-up. The replies will still expand underneath the video, as we first saw here. Personally, I don't really have a strong opinion about this new layout for comments. It doesn't make comments any easier to navigate, but it's not really any harder either. The only real advantage is the ability to see the number of comments without having to scroll down, but I doubt that's something that most people are concerned about. I suppose this layout makes things a bit less cluttered, with the comments tucked away until you want to read them? Anyhow, keep in mind that this is just a test; there's no guarantee that this will be coming to everyone's devices.

One on the video overlay, another by the like/dislike buttons. Like, why? Atique Ahmed They also need to move the Cast button. I've accidentally pressed it too many times. Carson Saldanha Prob want to keep it in line with YouTube desktop. Taco Monster It's also the wrong share button. tim242 I disabled this awful app. If I need to see a video, the mobile site is much better. SpasilliumNexus Said no one ever... tim242 WTF Ever. The app is awful. Artem Russakovskii I'm with @SpasilliumNexus:disqus. You're nuts if you think the mobile site is better/faster. tim242 On the mobile site, you can go down the list and open the videos you want to see in new tabs. In the app, it constantly jumps back to the top of the list. If they could fix that, then I would favor the app. Roger Moum So Add to que isn't good enough? I for one never watch 2 videos simultaniously so the apps Add to que works fine :) Cakefish I wish YouTube would automatically remove videos I've watched from my Watch Later list. It's annoying having to remove them manually. Corey Kinard Where is this "add to que" option? I get it on Chromecast, but never even viewing from the mobile. Add to only lets me out it in a playlist or watch later where I have to manually remove it later. Roger Moum My bad, sorry, yes Add to que is only on chromecast, on my cell I use a dedicated playlist to store "next" vids and then just delete the complete list when done ;) Corey Kinard Dammit. I thought my prayers had been answered! How are the missing basic que functionality​? It's even worse when I'm using YTMusic and I can't choose "play next" on songs. Autoplay just doesn't cut it all the time. Kamran Mackey No it doesn't, Tim. It doesn't jump back to the top of the list. When was the last time you ACTUALLY used the YouTube mobile app? Serious question. tim242 The subscription list most certainly does. That is the number one complaint about the app. Giorgos Kylafas However, the app is missing an essential (for me) feature: adjust playback speed. It it the main reason I don't watch videos on my phone. Carson Saldanha Have you tried commenting on the mobile site? It's awful. They're in like reverse chronological order. Suicide_Note You can sort them either by most recent comment, or by highest rated. Carson Saldanha For comment replies, I'm talking about. tim242 They can be sorted. But, I do not go to read comments there. That is a toxic wasteland. CFandHappy That's what's so fun about them! lol senor_heisenberg I actually like this change. Teja I want "add to watch later" option for the video that is being watched currently. You can do this using "add to" option in the app.. but I want this option on Youtube desktop. Japzone Watch Later appears as a playlist in the Desktop website. Just click "Add to" and search for Watch Later. Teja yea. Got it. It would be nice if they had implemented that with a watch later button. Ezzy Any chance you could bite into the fact that they AGAIN broke commenting totally? Notifications open the video and you can't reply to comments quickly in any way. It's ABSURD. Exo_heliosphere Who doesn't use Google plus for YouTube commenting? Timmy Turner Use Google+ for commenting so much simpler Japzone Except when Google+ doesn't show me the actual YouTube reply when I tap the notification. Happens randomly to specific comment threads. Just gives me a view of the opening comment and a thumbnail of the video it was posted to. Sahajpreet I have the same problem! Timmy Turner I've not had that issue, that's very problematic. Japzone It's been a pain in the butt. And I hate the new Youtube notifications that require loading the entire video page just so that I can see the comment replies. So stupid. Ezzy It doesn't work. It used to, but now notifications on gmail and google sites etc. just open the video and its comments instead of direct replies for me. Timmy Turner Maybe it's a setting on your account? It always jumps to the comments for me. Đức Thành It's a welcome change, but does Google plan to never do anything about the Share button? Jalal Apparently it's popular to hate on anything Google works on. Fair enough, they are batshit crazy at times (read MPD) but come on, give credit where credit's due. xyz Poor billion dollar corporation. Never gets its due. CFandHappy LOL, I know right? andyy Google, just remove the skip/next/previous button already. At least move it somewhere else where I can't press it accidentally. Who uses those button while we're *not* in a playlist? DragoCubed I kinda like it kinda don't. I guess it's something you have to get used to. I dislike youtube comments because they aren't like reddit (or twitter or disqus) comments, you can't see a chain. Lord Argyris Since the comments are hidden behind this button and must be explicitly summoned, this change might make it slightly less likely that I'll ever accidentally read a YouTube comment. DragoCubed "This is awesome. 10 of 10 would bleach my eyes again. NSFL, the youtube comments are cancer." Chris :) Love to help. xyz Why not just remove the YouTube comment section? Nothing of value will be lost. AbbyZFresh The comment section gives YouTube its social value and engagement teddyfrozevelt "Value" It is physically impossible for YouTube comments to have less value. If there was less value, the servers storing the comments would overflow and collapse into black holes sucking up the entire earth. Timmy Turner I disagree. The comment section is where a lot of feedback takes place for the content creators and the viewers. CFandHappy NO WAY!!! wow I wish they would just add playback speed options... I don't really see the point in changes like this unless the app already has all the functionality of the desktop site Marcel Mayer oh guys... so late? i have it since 2 weeks Justin Moving username to below is a bad move. Google should buy Disqus, they make perfect comment section. TechView I have had this for a few weeks already, here in Poland. CFandHappy I've spent two days totally confused thinking the app was playing up. Only saw the "comments" button that was under my nose today. lol I just wish they'd make a way you can see the comments you're replying to while you're replying. And pause a video if you're replying while it's still playing! someguy Finally I can scroll through the comments without scrolling away from the video, What took so long! newsforme Made a video on youtube comments that annoy me, would be great if someone could have a look if you want https://youtu.be/5DKgfPrjjRo Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 3 [Deal Alert] Staples has the Lenovo ThinkPad Chromebook 11e for $140 ($210 off) 2017/04/16 1:11pm PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] The first episode of Doctor Who season 10, plus the first episode of Class (a spinoff), are free on Google Play 2017/04/16 8:33am PDTApr 16, 2017 23 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Nice work from Wijnaldum on the right feeds Firmino, who clips a beautiful cross to the back stick where Milner arrives, but he hoys the volley well over the bar.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.37am EDT 09:37 49 mins: Robson-Kanu goes into the book for having a sneaky little stamp on Can’s foot.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.09am EDT 09:09 39 mins: A careless pass from Matip puts Lovren in all sorts, and he can’t keep the ball in, out on Liverpool’s right.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 04.16.17. 04.16.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am A Chip Revolution Will Bring Better VR Sooner Than You Think Getty Images David Kosslyn and Ian Thompson are the founders of a virtual reality company called Angle Technologies. Two years into this stealth project, backed by $8 million in funding, they won’t say much about the virtual world they’re building—at least not publicly. But they will say that they’re building it in a way that alters the relationship between computer hardware and software. When a PC or a game console runs this virtual world, the GPU chips play an unexpectedly large role, taking so much of the burden off the main processor. GPU is short for graphics processing unit. These chips were originally designed as a better way of rendering graphics for games and other software. And they still play this all-important role for the virtual world under development at Angle. But that’s not all. Kosslyn and Thompson are shifting countless other tasks onto these chips, just because GPUs are so good at running so many calculations in parallel. A single machine can hold hundreds of GPU chips, and each chip can operate largely on its own. Juggling hundreds of digital tasks at the same time, Kosslyn and Thompson say, these chips can get you far closer to the illusion that you’re standing in an alternate universe. Related Video How a Chip Is Made When they first started building their virtual world, Kosslyn and Thompson pushed most of those tasks through the CPU, a computer’s main processor. But that just didn’t work. As Kosslyn explains, they used the CPU to create new objects as you moved through this world—trees, bushes, rocks, and whatever else they needed to mimic reality. Loading each object into the chip took about one-fifth of a millisecond—far too long, considering just how many objects they needed to load. “If you scale that up to 10 million objects, you’re suddenly crushed by the order of magnitude. Just loading the world is incredibly slow,” Kosslyn says. “We thought: ‘Man, if only we had a parallel way of doing all these pretty much independent operations really quickly.’ And, well, that’s exactly what the GPU is really good at.” Their approach is part of a much wider shift across the world of hardware and software. For decades, the processing power available from individual computer chips increased every 18 months or so, according to the oft-quoted Moore’s Law. But in recent years, this trend has begun to slow, even as modern software applications demanded far more processing power than ever before. “Some people call it the end of Moore’s Law,” says Google chip engineer Norm Jouppi. “I like to call it the retirement of Moore’s Law, because it’s not totally dead yet but it’s definitely not working as hard.” The result: Companies and coders are now moving workloads off the main CPU and onto a wide range of alternative processors. If they can’t get enough processing power from a single chip, they need many. These changes have already pushed through the massive data centers that underpin the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. Because their sweeping online services can no longer handle all tasks on CPUs alone, these companies are moving major processing loads onto GPUs, programmable chips called FPGAs, and even custom-built chips, such as the AI processor that Jouppi helped design at Google. Neural networks and other forms of AI are often the driving forces behind this shift. Related Stories Paul Sarconi Intel’s Got a Plan to Dominate VR. First Stop? March Madness Cade Metz Building an AI Chip Saved Google From Building a Dozen New Data Centers Klint Finley Intel’s 15 Billion Reasons Why an AI Chip Revolution Has Arrived The shift is so big, it’s sending ripples across the worldwide chip market. The fortunes of nvidia, the world’s largest GPU marker, are on the upswing. And Intel, which isn’t a big player in GPUs, has spent billions acquiring companies that make FPGAs and various AI chips. Now, as Kosslyn and Thompson show, the trend is also moving to the other end of the internet, pushing onto PCs and game consoles. Neural networks are helping to drive the change here as well, but in the long run, VR may be the bigger driving force. With virtual reality, so much of the processing must happen on the client, not in the data center. VR must operate in real-time. It can’t spare the added milliseconds needed to send its calculations over the wire. That spoils the effect. And by the same token, it can’t spare the added milliseconds needed to shove all calculations through the client’s main processor. “There are tasks that are completely intractable on the CPU,” Kosslyn says. For their virtual world, Kosslyn and Thompson are working to leverage all the extra GPU processing power available on high-end PCs and game consoles. “We’re mostly trying to fill in those few milliseconds when GPUs can do work besides rendering graphics,” Thompson says. But in the long run, as virtual worlds become more popular—and even more complex—this could push hardware sellers to pack even more GPU power into PCs and consoles. Device makers may also push GPUs or other alternative chips into the VR headsets, so that they can operate without help from PCs and consolers. And the trend could reach smartphones, which are often used in lieu of dedicated headsets. Zvi Greenstein, general manager for consumer VR at nVidia, says the company views virtual reality as an enormous market opportunity. Kosslyn and Thompson warn that the tools for building code that runs on GPUs is still a little rough around the edges, but companies like nVidia are working to change that. Related Video Google’s Daydream View Is a VR Eye Pillow Frank Soqui, the general manager of Intel’s virtual reality and gaming group, questions how many VR developers will really transfer workloads onto GPUs. But keep in mind that GPUs are mostly the domain of nVidia, one of Intel’s primary competitors. Nonetheless, Soqui does believe that the market will continue to shift towards alternative processors. Intel recently acquired a startup called Movidius, which makes specialized chips for devices that can sense the world around them—gizmos like robots and driverless cars. But Soqui says Movidius chips can also help VR headsets process what’s happening in the real world, such as in where you head in pointing. Meanwhile, Microsoft has already build a specialized processor for its Hololens augmented reality headset to help the device keep track of your movements, among other things. In the end, this is yet another example of computing tasks shiftings off the CPU and onto something else. The upshot? Developers like Kosslyn and Thompson must think very differently about how these build their software. But that’s just one consequence of this change. It also means yet another shift in the global chip market, even further towards GPUs and other alternative processors. And, most notably, it means that virtual reality will evolve very differently than it would if coders kept most tasks on the CPU. VR will get much better, much faster. Go Back to Top.

Published on April 16, 2017. 0 After “Similar Items” went live, Google’s new image search feature will “help you boost your search style IQ”. Google has been rolling out some updates to its Image Search platform on mobile devices, and the newest addition will include tools to ease fashion research and coordinating outfits. The company has announced a brand new feature within Google image search to find “style ideas”.  The feature will work based on your previous image searches for various articles. The new tools work in conjunction with the “Similar Items” changes that rolled out a few days ago. The feature provides links to more consumer items when looking at a product’s image. It’s quite similar to Google Shopping. “Similar Items” is based on identifying the items from a certain image and then providing you with similar matches. Let’s say you’re searching for a pair of cool sunglasses, but you adore the shoes that the model is wearing in the photo; you’ll be able to see what they might be. Of course, the feature isn’t going to be always right, but it’s worth the shot. The latest “Style Ideas” is going to compliment this feature. When you search for that bag or that great jacket you fancy so much, besides the fact that you’re going to be shown more similar items, you’re also going to see more examples of that particular item in use. You can check out what that hat would look like paired with a cute belt. This feature might not be the biggest hit for all users, but if you’re into fashion or if you’re simply looking for more new outfits, you’ll find it very useful and sleek. The latest trend for commercialization in Google’s image search still continues, and maybe someday, it will totally get to replace the manual research for future purchases.

According to the latest details about the Nexus 6P, we might even see a revival of this Nexus brand in the days to come. It was even tested in the Android O previews, and for this reason, people think that it’s going to be one of the best phones in the series. Moreover, fans believe in its chances to success and even to defeat the Google Pixel, after its countless struggles to maintain its popularity. Is There Hope? PC-Tablet published an article showing a couple of reasons why Google would not choose to retire this much appreciated device. According to the latest update, we could spot in the Android O preview some changes: a more attractive look, a new interface for the battery, a new Settings menu and a Sleep menu. Along with the rollout of the Android O preview for the Nexus 6P, the company showed that both Pixel and Nexus 6P devices have switched from the in-kernel FUSE to the SDCardFS option on the new mobile OS. Of course, most of the changes are found under the hood. This important change could mean that on these phones, Google is going to cut down on the I/O overhead when it comes to operations performance on external storage. Moreover, it represents a huge leap for the Nexus 6P, since this upgrade was not included in the Android Nougat update. At the same time, it seems that Google Pixel is having a hard time trying to get as many customers, since more and more people come back to Nexus 6P, and this despite the tech giant’s efforts of marketing it as being made by Google. Briefly, one of the reason why Google Pixel might be losing its popularity is the fact that it has a high price, of $650 for a base model, while the Nexus 6P starts at $499.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  +  one  =  8 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter You can join the $7.2 trillion economic revolution with what some call "OBL" fuel. But what is "OBL" fuel? Recently discovered in the Andes Mountains, locals call this crystal "Oro Blanco" or "White Gold." What Is "OBL" Fuel? The Holy Grail of Energy The name is fitting since demand for "OBL" fuel from the automobile industry alone is set to increase 11 times current production levels. This energy source is 1,693 times more powerful than gasoline. One gallon of OBL fuel could power your car from New York City to Los Angeles and back seven times. "OBL" fuel is so efficient because it doesn't evaporate in high heat. With a boiling point of 2,457 degrees Fahrenheit, or over 20 times higher than gas, there is no chance of any fuel burning off in the heat of the engine. "OBL" fuel is so powerful that Alphabet Inc.'s (Nasdaq: GOOG) Google was one of the first to invest in related technologies. It is a central piece in Google's plan to independently produce 100% of its own energy for its offices in every major country, housing 61,814 employees. Google isn't the only major corporation with a 100% independent energy production plan, either. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has a similar mission, and the savings are estimated to be $1 billion a year. With large corporations jumping on board with this "OBL" fuel, demand is soaring, and that will create a huge profit opportunity… Profiting from OBL Fuel Demand for OBL fuel is so high, and the crystals are so scarce, that this energy play could be even bigger than the fracking boom. The price of OBL fuel has doubled twice in the last 14 months. That kind of price increase will mint money for anyone who has a claim. And that's what this tiny little miner in Death Valley is sitting on. The claim has an estimated 816,000 metric tons of OBL fuel, valuing the reserve at $20.4 billion. This tract of land in Death Valley isn't the miner's only claim in OBL fuel, either. With control over so much of the supply, this company could help you make a fortune. By getting in on the ground floor of this investment, you could have the opportunity to create generational wealth. Money Morning Global Energy Strategist Dr. Kent Moors put together a short presentation that will show you exactly how to profit from OBL fuel.
