One of Google’s founding principles. Image credits Tangi Bertin / Flickr. The measure of the sheer success Google has achieved is that they’re no longer just the guys who do your searching for you — it has become the de facto verb for it. While that isn’t likely to change anytime soon, the company is switching its focus away from search engines to put A.I. development on the forefront. “We continue to set the pace in machine learning and A.I. research,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a call [embedded at the end of the article] to investors on Thursday to report the company’s Q1 2017 earnings. “We’re transitioning to an A.I.-first company.” So what does this mean for Google, and what does it mean for you? Well, in short, Google wants to become the first totally personalized corporation, tailoring their service to each individual. We’ll probably see machine learning embedded at the core of most of Google’s systems and platforms — such as Google’s Assistant service being merged with Android and Chrome OSs. The goal will be to use machine learning to tailor the devices to each user, timing apps and notifications after their usual schedule or location, personal interests, or other characteristics such as typing habits. Last year, Pichai said that the ultimate goal of Assistant is that if you ask for a pizza, it will bring you that pizza without any further input or oversight required. The company also has to figure out how to keep increasing the number and sophistication of its machine learning algorithms without increasing energy or mobile data use — which would cripple current devices. ADVERTISEMENT Pichai said they would increasingly rely on Google’s recently unveiled “federated learning” technology. It should allow A.I. to run more efficiently on the limited resources a mobile device can marshal, for example, allowing for a wider range of applications while saving up on battery and bandwidth. What about Search Although Google is looking to focus on A.I., search currently remains its single most profitable platform. But even though they’re shifting focus away from search, Google thinks A.I. would only make its results more relevant and its ads more profitable. It would let them find patterns of search and favorite results more easily, and eventually even predict them. It would let Google not only give you what you ask for but predict what you’ll ask for, even change what you want — if that’s a good thing or not, I guess it’s a question we all have to answer for ourselves. Still, this answers why Google is moving away from search as its main focus — there’s a lot of profit to be made with machine learning, especially through analysis of search behavior. Everything done online with even a minute involvement of a Google platform will become quantifiable, and monetizable. Until now, they’ve relied on a sort of passive data acquisition with you coming to them, via search, and feeding the data yourself. A.I. will take up the busywork of actively gathering the data. And the sort of things they can do with this data is amazing. Think about driving home and being prompted with what parking spaces are open near your house in Google Maps. Food shops that cater your absolute favorite kinds of foods in whatever town you happen to be in, or all over the globe on Earth. But with so much data on their hands, the risk of Google derailing from their founding principle of “Don’t be evil” becomes a lot harder to maintain — and a lot scarier if broken.

Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. will in the coming days add evidence that tech behemoths command an ever widening share of consumer time and spending. Amazon’s revenue soared as shoppers favored it over brick-and-mortar stores, while Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business -- especially on smartphones. "Each has built unique moats that allow them to continue to dominate,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. “For Google, no one can catch them on search because of the technology and intellectual property. For Amazon, scale is their friend and no one can compete on selection, price and fulfillment capabilities.” The companies have vast networks of complementary products that feed off one another to generate more sales, making it ever harder for competitors to keep up. "Given the strength of Google and Amazon, we think Facebook is likely to look similar," Schachter said. On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to report first-quarter profit of $2.57 billion, up 70 percent from a year earlier, while revenue climbs 45 percent to $7.82 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. When Apple reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sales are expected to climb 5 percent to $53 billion. Revenue from the App Store and other services such as Apple Music will likely jump 20 percent to $7.2 billion, according to UBS analyst Steven Milunovich. "The general theme that the big are getting bigger" applies to Apple’s self-feeding ecosystem, Schachter said. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys apps and other services, feeding data such as photos and contacts into the device, making it harder to swap for a competitor’s device. Higher margin service revenue then feeds back into Apple’s development budget, helping it build more advanced products to sell to the same consumer. Google’s advertising business is very different, but has similar self-feeding qualities. The company got 97 percent of mobile paid search clicks in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017, according to client data from digital marketing firm Merkle Inc. That was up from 82 percent in the same period in 2014. With more searches, Google gets more ad dollars to reinvest to keep its search engine ahead of the competition -- mostly represented by Microsoft Corp.’s Bing. Google also gets more data on what results people click on, which can be used to improve its software even more, and keep people coming back to find information. "There are clear benefits to that scale," Mark Ballard, senior director of research at Merkle, said. "There’s that feedback loop." For advertisers, Google’s large online audience makes it one of the first places to go to run online marketing campaigns. The other is Facebook. Merkle client spending on Facebook ads was up 71 percent in the first quarter, from a year earlier. These advertisers get about 70 percent of their online traffic from Facebook and that hasn’t changed in recent years despite the rise of competitors like Snap Inc., Ballard noted. Facebook and Google captured 77 percent of U.S. digital ad spending last year, up from 72 percent in 2015, according to a recent analysis of data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau by Pivotal Research Group. For advertisers it’s “easier to concentrate budgets with a smaller number of players. It’s easier to manage,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. Marketers have long griped about the "duopoly" atop digital advertising. But they keep giving Google and Facebook money. That’s largely because few other places offer wide reach, channels for targeting consumers and better returns. Those advantages only multiply as the tech companies expand. Verizon Communications Inc.’s new Oath ad business "may figure out a special sauce, but they will never be the first port of call," Wieser said. When Google and Facebook get those calls first, they see what advertisers plan to spend elsewhere and can sell them other services and tools, according to the analyst. Advertisers disagree about what company could offer a viable third alternative. Some suggest another internet titan: Amazon. The largest online retailer isn’t a leading digital advertising destination yet, but on its earnings call last week, Chief Financial Officer Brian Oslavsky reported "consistent growth" from that business. Research firm EMarketer expects the company to generate more display ad revenue than Twitter Inc. by next year. Even so, most of Amazon’s first-quarter revenue gains came from grabbing retail market share as more people shop online, rather than in stores. That shift is fueling a record pace of retailer bankruptcies this year, despite a growing U.S. economy and solid consumer spending. What began with bookstores, movie rental outlets and electronics retailers like Borders, Blockbuster and Circuit City, is spreading to apparel and sporting goods chains like Aeropostale Inc. and Sports Authority Holdings Inc. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Once online spending in a category passes 20 percent, it’s tough for brick-and-mortar retailers to survive and easy for Amazon to gobble up market share, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive officer of Boomerang Commerce Inc., which designs software for large retailers. Amazon has been disciplined about only pursuing retail categories that are already shifting online, giving it momentum against competitors playing defense, he said, adding that more apparel bankruptcies will come in the next two years. Like Google, which has introduced the Pixel smartphone to help secure its direct relationship with consumers, Amazon has introduced the Echo smart speaker to encourage customers to buy services and products from its website. The software makers are expanding into hardware to feed their money machines. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Brought to you in partnership with MongoDB. Do you have an unreasonable fear of cronjobs? Find spinning up VMs to be a colossal waste of your towering intellect? Does the thought of checking a folder regularly for updates fill you with an apoplectic rage? If so, you should probably get some help. Maybe find another line of work. In the meantime, here’s one way to ease your regular file processing anxieties. With just one application of Google Cloud Functions, eased gently up your Dataflow Pipeline, you can find lasting relief from troublesome cronjobs. But first, some assumptions. Assumptions? You’ve got gcloud installed, you’ve created a project, and you’ve enabled the dataflow and cloud functions APIs. If you haven’t, then a few minutes of reading the Google docs should get you started. I’m Ready Now We are going to set up a Google Cloud Function that will get called every time a cloud storage bucket gets updated. That function will kick off a dataflow pipeline (using the handy new templates) to process the file with whatever complicated data transformations somebody further up the food chain has specified. Hang on, You’ve Lost Me OK, maybe I should have been a bit more explicit in my assumptions. Here’s a quick cheat sheet: Cloud functions: serverless little bits of code (like Amazon’s Lambdas) Dataflow: a managed service for processing large amounts of data Cloud storage: Google’s equivalent of S3 OK, Carry on, We’re Good The first step is to create a few buckets (you can call them whatever you want, but these are the names I’ve used in the rest of this article): One for keeping the code for your cloud function: cloud-fn-staging One for keeping the code for your pipeline: pipeline-staging The bucket you want to monitor for updates: incoming-files If you’re not sure how to create buckets, Google’s docs can help. Or just start clicking around randomly in the cloud console. You’ll work it out. I believe in you, champ. Now What? Now we’re going to make a Dataflow Template. If you’ve already got a pipeline, you can use that one, but I mangled one of the example pipelines that Google gives you. There’s a little fiddly detail here: Templates were introduced in version 1.9.0 of the Dataflow Java libraries, so you’ll need at least that version. However, if you go for the latest 2.x version (which is also the default version that the maven archetypes generate), the way to create your template changes. But the Google docs haven’t been updated for that version. To create the example pipeline, I ran the following maven command: mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=google-cloud-dataflow-java-archetypes-examples \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=com.google.cloud.dataflow \
    -DarchetypeVersion=1.9.0 \
    -DgroupId=com.shinesolutions \
    -DartifactId=dataflow-template-poc \
    -Dversion="0.1" \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -Dpackage=com.shinesolutions
 Notice the -DarchetypeVersion=1.9.0 option, which ensures that I’m using that version of the libs. Without that option, you’ll end up with the 2.x versions (which I will explain how to use as well, don’t worry). This generates some sample code, including the Dataflow standard WordCount. I edited this to make it templatable. I also invented the word templatable, just now. You can use it, though, it’s cool. Here’s the important changes, first in the WordCountOptions interface (in the WordCount class): public interface WordCountOptions extends PipelineOptions {
    @Description("Path of the file to read from")
    @Validation.Required
    ValueProvider < String > getInputFile();
    void setInputFile(ValueProvider < String > value);

    @Description("Path of the file to write to")
    @Validation.Required
    ValueProvider < String > getOutputFile();
    void setOutputFile(ValueProvider < String > value);
} Instead of the options just being String values, they are now ValueProvider types. This lets the Runner know that these values will be provided later. The main method looks like this: public static void main(String[] args) {
    WordCountOptions options = PipelineOptionsFactory.fromArgs(args).withValidation()
        .as(WordCountOptions.class);
    Pipeline p = Pipeline.create(options);

    p.apply(TextIO.Read.named("ReadLines").from(options.getInputFile()).withoutValidation())
        .apply(new CountWords())
        .apply(ParDo.of(new FormatAsTextFn()))
        .apply(TextIO.Write.named("WriteCounts").to(options.getOutputFile()).withoutValidation());

    p.run();
} The important thing to note here is the .withoutValidation() modifier to the TextIO.Read. If you don’t do that, your template won’t get created because TextIO will try to validate the option values before they’ve been supplied. We’re going to use TextIO in this example, but PubSub and BigQuery input/output in dataflow also support passing in options from templates. To create our template, run this command: mvn compile exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass=com.shinesolutions.WordCount \
    -Dexec.args="--project=<your project> \
    --stagingLocation=gs://pipeline-staging \
    --dataflowJobFile=gs://pipeline-staging/templates/WordCount \
    --runner=TemplatingDataflowPipelineRunner"
 If that succeeded, your template has been created. Remember the value you supplied for the dataflowJobFile option, you’ll need that in your cloud function. If you chose to use the 2.x version of the libraries, you probably got an error. I did tell you not to, but you knew better, didn’t you? The command for 2.x looks like this: mvn compile exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass=com.shinesolutions.WordCount \
    -Dexec.args="--project=<your project> \
    --stagingLocation=gs://pipeline-staging \
    --templateLocation=gs://pipeline-staging/templates/WordCount \
    --runner=DataflowRunner"
 I haven’t tested this with version 2.x, so don’t blame me if that command deletes the Internet or something. Template's Done. What Next? Now you need your cloud function. They are written in JavaScript running on Node.js, so you should probably install that. Then, in a suitable directory, run npm init to set up a package.json file, which will tell Google what your dependencies are. It will ask you a lot of questions, but don’t stress about the answers, they’re not a big deal. Our cloud function is going to talk to the Dataflow API, so you’ll need to install that dependency. Run npm install --save googleapis to get that done. (Confusingly there are two versions of Node.js support from Google, the @google-cloud packages don’t support Dataflow yet though). The cloud function looks like this: const google = require('googleapis');

exports.goWithTheDataFlow = function(event, callback) {
    const file = event.data;
    if (file.resourceState === 'exists' && file.name) {
        google.auth.getApplicationDefault(function(err, authClient, projectId) {
            if (err) {
                throw err;
            }

            if (authClient.createScopedRequired && authClient.createScopedRequired()) {
                authClient = authClient.createScoped([
                    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
                    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email'
                ]);
            }

            const dataflow = google.dataflow({
                version: 'v1b3',
                auth: authClient
            });

            dataflow.projects.templates.create({
                projectId: projectId,
                resource: {
                    parameters: {
                        inputFile: `gs://${file.bucket}/${file.name}`,
                        outputFile: `gs://${file.bucket}/${file.name}-wordcount`
                    },
                    jobName: 'cloud-fn-dataflow-test',
                    gcsPath: 'gs://pipeline-staging/templates/WordCount'
                }
            }, function(err, response) {
                if (err) {
                    console.error("problem running dataflow template, error was: ", err);
                }
                console.log("Dataflow template response: ", response);
                callback();
            });

        });
    }
}; We’re going to trigger our cloud function from files being uploaded to a GCS bucket, so goWithTheDataFlow gets called with an event that has a few useful properties. The main one is event.data, which contains the information about the updated resource. We check if the resource exists (because we also get notifications of deletes from the bucket). Then we authenticate – because we’re a cloud function, default application auth is all set up for you – and create a Dataflow API client. Make the call to our dataflow template and we are done. Easy. Now we upload our function to Google’s cloud with a command that looks like this: gcloud beta functions deploy goWithTheDataFlow \
    --stage-bucket cloud-fn-staging \
    --trigger-bucket incoming-files
 If that all went OK, we should be good to test with a file. Awesome. How Do I Know It’s Working? The cloud function logs go to Stackdriver Logging in your Google Cloud console. Upload a file to the bucket, and in a few seconds, you should be able to see some output there. Any errors will appear here, and also trigger an email to you as well (by default anyway). You can see your Dataflow pipeline in the usual Dataflow area of the cloud console, and you can see the output files (if you used the WordCount code from above) in the same bucket as your source file. Great. What Should I Do Now? You’ll probably want to get rid of that test cloud function at some point. Do that with a command like this: gcloud beta functions delete goWithTheDataFlow
 Then make a cup of tea. Put your feet up, close your eyes, let your mind relax and just think about all those cronjobs you can delete. Imagine grinding them under your heel, and setting fire to the VMs they run on. Better now? Good.

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail? David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/16 1:01pm PDTApr 16, 2017 72 Plus 1 on G+ 136 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Applications Polls Google Inbox and Gmail have been competing for our hearts (and email) for some time now, and it doesn't seem like Google is slowing down development of either [great] app. Clearly, Gmail is for some, and Inbox for others - so which one are you? I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? Vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event Geoff Johnson Gmail does this as well. Markus Birth The last time I checked, GMail didn't detect all the types Inbox did. Also GMail doesn't combine everything into "Trips", does it? StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same demarcmj This. I don't use any of the fancy "features" of Inbox... I just like it because the interface is nicer. But for some reason on the desktop Inbox is slower than molasses. Like dial-up speed on a decades-old computer slow. So I use gmail on desktop. SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Kyle J Inbox is not supposed to send you notifications unless they are important. I got so many Gmail notifications I did not need. I use Inbox just for personal use though. I'm not sure how I would feel about using it for work since I have never used it that way. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. Kevin Sword Adding on to this, add all bundles to the inbox. Check your spam folder 📂 frequently. Otherwise you might miss important mail ✉ that the AI thinks is unimportant. theProffer Same. I followed the repliers' suggestions as well, and I still have issues with Inbox's push notifications. It almost gives me the impression that it's polling and not pushing (I know it's not, but it's laggy as if that). If I could get these email notifications immediately, I'd probably switch, but I also love some of the more granular controls Gmail has (which maybe Inbox has duplicated over time, I haven't tried it in about 6'ish months). -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Brian Nice Word Play Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail Raymond Hawkins I was forgetting that one. I do occasionally open Gmail for filters also. Roy Yeah, I like Inbox, but Google has such a bad habit of replacing working apps/sites/etc with "better" replacements that don't have feature parity. catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ OhYeah! I think Google has also totally failed at search in the play store. I almost never get the app I want even in the first page of results when searching for the exact name. shonangreg They had been failing with youtube as well. Search for something, find something similar, and then browse the suggested related videos? Trash! I was repeatedly watching videos that were being voted thumbs down 10:1. Why? It made me give up on trying to browse youtube for anything. All those videos there, and I just stopped. Recently it seems to be better. Not sure why. Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Martins Nkem Where does it store the attachments you've viewed? Kevin Sword It doesn't? You have to manually download them. catalysto They remain in Inbox. Where else would they go? Martins Nkem What i meant was this.. In Gmail, attachments are usually saved in the downloads folder in local storage, where does Inbox save its own files catalysto They can be kept in Inbox, saved to Drive, or downloaded locally. Not sure what else you'd need. Martins Nkem Which folder is it downloaded to locally? catalysto Whichever one you want! You've never used the Save As dialog?! Martins Nkem On mobile? catalysto Ohhhhh, on mobile. Forgive me; I was thinking desktop. But yeah, on mobile, attachments go to the Downloads folder like other apps. Martins Nkem Not in my case, it redownloads the files every time catalysto Redownloads? As in downloads every time you tell it to download? That's normal. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Mbdo In Gmail, on the categories (like "social" for example) I have some "ad" emails just like Google AdWords on the Web... It's not the case for Inbox. Check this screenshot : https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca9d6f5a0599814fa001c5add402543e0ab9e13c245dcd6e5177bb5026c9708b.png Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. Fruity101079 It's strange to understand. On friday, just leave your unread emails where there are. There will be there on Monday when you will come back to your office... roberto.elena I manage several email addresses within a single Gmail account, including my work email. Fruity101079 Why mix work and personal emails if you don't want to check them on the weekend? Didn't your employer give you a phone? roberto.elena I don't receive work emails on the weekends, so it's not that I don't want to check new work emails on the weekends, it's that I don't need to see the pending emails in my inbox while I definitely don't need them until monday. And yes, I prefer to mix personal and work emails in the same app (I use filters and labels I already created in Gmail, not just the automatic categories of Inbox, and they work with Inbox just fine too). The work email weekend situation is just one example of why I love snoozing, but there are many interesting uses. You buy something on ebay from Hong Kong and it's expected to arrive in 10-15 days. Well no need to have that in you inbox 10 days, you just snooze it. Somebody tells you they are going to contact you back in 3 days time, Well, 3 days later, that email reappears in your inbox to remind you that, in case they didn't. Etc. If you don't have a too many of those emails cluttering your inbox, then it's understandable you don't see the need for snoozing, but for many of us Inbox is the best that has happened to email since Gmail was launched. The same way that Gmail turned emails into conversations (and of course also offered 1GB instead Hotmail's 15-25 MB), changing email for many of us forever, Inbox has turned emails into tasks, with its done/pinned/snoozed paradigm. Fruity101079 Sure sure, it's a nice thing to have to choice. I understand the kind of use you can make with inbox now you explained it. It's just I'm not concerned. akshay7394 You sure asked a lot of questions considering you aren't concerned 😂 Fruity101079 We are here to discuss :) Geoff Johnson That seems overly complicated. Why not have a work email and a personal email? Why have them both go to the same inbox? That way you can just ignore anything coming to your personal email without it cluttering your personal inbox. roberto.elena Because I still want to check my personal email while I'm at work, my private life doesn't stop simply because I'm at work, and I don't get many work related emails outside of working hours, so they don't bother me in my free time, and even when I do get some, it's so easy and fast to snooze them, so it is much better for me to have everything in one place. In my case it's​ more complicated having two inboxes instead of one. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. Fruity101079 If you don't need to pay attention to some emails (spam?), why not just delete them? catalysto Because I often want to come back to them later. For example, an email to pay a bill, but I don't want to do it at work. If I want to snooze that action until I get home, I can do that. And that's the core difference with Inbox: emails aren't just messages; they are to-dos. For someone who likes to use the zero-inbox, GTD flow, it's amazing. But of course, that's personal preference, and I get that lots of people don't use email that way. Geoff Johnson That's exactly what I don't like about it. Then those emails get lost and forgotten about. If it's spam, just delete/block it. Kevin Sword That's what you use the snooze feature for. It'll send you another notification when you actually need to get something done. catalysto But I'm not talking about spam. I'm talking about messages I want to deal with at a later time. I never see spam in my inbox. And the snoozed messages don't get "lost and forgotten". Snoozed emails reappear at a predetermined time or place. Kevin Sword Yeah, I always have a completely clear inbox which is pretty incredible. I can snooze stuff that doesn't need to be dealt with. catalysto Yeah, I love seeing that sun shining background when I'm done with my tasks. =) tekfr33kn Choices... Michael Hazell If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. I pretty much do that, or just flag the email for follow-up. I guess I'm too much of an Outlook user. m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. m-p{3} Yeah, at some point I figured that I couldn't possibly sort through it all, so I had to make the call to mark everything "done" and keep my mailbox clean from that moment. So far, my goal is to reach that beautiful sun at the end of the day. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/414cadbe40ffe9b274cc1af9f92d36e8753dc782ac466fc16e1de0959c6fb364.png Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). roberto.elena You can use the same labels and filters in Inbox, they work exactly like the automatic Inbox bundles. Marvin R. yes I know. But actually I'm loosing how many are unread in the labels and (which is worse for me) I loose the colors of labels :( roberto.elena Well, if the label colors are important to you, then I agree it sucks. I used to have a lot of filters/labels in Gmail, but now using Inbox I found I don't need most of them, so the automatic Inbox categories plus a couple a my own labels work for me. At first I also felt some "read/unread anxiety", when I started using Inbox, but then I realized it wasn't an issue anymore. With Inbox my inbox is as clean as possible, so I can clearly see what's unread and what's read there. If something is not in my inbox, then it means I already decided whether it's "done" or "snoozed", so I don't really care about read/unread. Maybe you have filters that send emails to a label skipping the inbox and that's why you need the unread count, but I think the bundling in Inbox is a good alternative for that. Of course all of this is MY opinion, related to MY needs. Your mileage may vary. It's not the first poll of this kind that i see, and Inbox adoption is clearly improving over time. I don't remember any spectacular changes in Inbox lately, so I think one of the reasons is that people are slowly understanding how to better use Inbox, and that's why I replied to several comments here, to explain things they might not realize. Of course, there will be always people that don't use Inbox despite fully understanding its features. You might be one of them... or not. kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... obarthelemy Yes there is. Tags, rules, filters, snooze.... are nonstandard, so if you start to depend on them on them you can no longer move away. Lock-in is not just about the raw data, it's also about the process you build around features. aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? lzdking Sexy is a common adjective to describe the aesthetics of inanimate objects (cars, boats, buildings etc...), not sure why you are taking exception to its use. My1 I thought maybe it was obvious, or just forgot the (/s), well Poe's Law strikes again ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Mike K? Not sure what you're getting at, I doubt most people here care. Kevin Sword Not until you're running your own server you're not! /s but seriously. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Adrien Baron You can configure everything if you want too, create your own bundles (which are actually just GMail tags under the hood), and choose wether you want them to appear bundled or not, and be notified or not. I almost had nothing to configure for my personal, but did it for my work address (we are using Inbox), and it works great. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. lzdking I'm surprised that I haven't seen more people mention using Outlook. While I don't use it myself (Inbox for me), Outlook is a very impressive Android e-mail client and the desktop interface isn't too shabby either. Marty It amazes me that Microsoft isn't capitalizing on Google's laziness. Not only is Microsoft's email better than anything Google has, but Google Search isn't anything like it used to be 5 to 8 years ago. Microsoft could step in and displace Google Search with their own search engine. Geoff Johnson That's what I don't get, there shouldn't be a need to "get used to it". Email is simple, it comes in you read/reply to it when you have time. If you don't want to now, simply ignore it and come back to it when you do. m-p{3} The thing is that keeping too many email "in sight" makes me unconsciously reread the titles everytime I go check my mailbox. If I can't reply to it right now (because of lack of info, progress) I can snooze it and keep it out of sight and focus on what's important right now. lzdking I don't get the "getting used to it" either. For me, I used inbox and was instantly amazed by how much more useful and organized it was. There was nothing to get, all my e-mails were automatically bundled into the categories I needed. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. shonangreg Aren't K9 and kaiten both abandonware? After years of no updates, I switched from kaiten to AquaMail on android (and Outlook on my iPad). I used to use Thunderbird on my PC's, but I removed it after it would repeatedly swell to several GB in size even though I was using IMAP with all accounts set to fairly minimal disk usage. Now I don't have an email app on my PC's. I just use my mobile devices for email and open gmail or hotmail in the browser if I feel like it. AquaMail works great: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kman.AquaMail&hl=en $5 for a professional email app is well worth it. Outlook works pretty well on the iPad, though I still can't get messages to go full screen to enlarge the fonts like it should do . . . HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? CD RW it works with other account if you "Gmailfy" them before https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 lomsha Aaah thank you. usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Scros97 You have to open the email you want to see the specific time and then click on the name of the other person. Doing so it displays more details like the date ;) Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Scros97 I do the very same usage of Gmail 😂 Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. CD RW they are automatically sorted in categories : notifications, travel, , social network ,financial,forums and deals And for each of these categories, you can choose how they appear on your Inbox : as soon as they arrive, once a day, once a week You can also create your own categories just like in gmail with labels HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Sherman Does Inbox support Yahoo or Live accounts? No? Even after a FULL YEAR since I last used it? Back to Gmail, then. CD RW Inbox support them if you "Gmailify" them : https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 Eleo Outlook all the way! Gmail app is not as user-friendly as outlook and inbox knows too much about me. I dont like that Jan-Lk Else Phone: Inbox, PC/Web: Gmail. Best combination! Captain_Invisible I'm shocked! I can't believe there are still people using the Gmail app, when the glorious Inbox exists. I could never go back. Marty Lol...most people probably have multiple email accounts. Can't have multiple account in Inbox. 😉 Kristian Ivanov Quite surprising that both options have a 43% score at the time I'm writting this comment O_o For me it's Gmail...I just don't need any of the Inbox features so no point in using it...I do see reasons why others like it though. AQ apps? neither, gmail through k9 mail. Martin B. I never saw poll this close here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0edf28e3e42c8d0ad2c36a79e66f5cd9b16a678152108035c59111ee155ec76c.jpg Fruity101079 Inbox GUI is better, Gmail looks old, but I don't understand all those things in Inbox. There are tabs/categories (i don't need) everywhere. Some emails are not displayed in the main box. And there is no notifications or visual thing that tell me there is something new in this categories. There are no folders anymore. So all your emails from the creation of your account are all displayed in your main box (!?). A lot of persons are talking of Snooze option, but I don't get its utility (it's the same on my alarm clock, when it rings in the morning, i wake up. Done. Why using a ring to wake you up just enough to push the snooze button that will ring again 1 minute later? It's incomprehensible...). And one more thing: not talking about work (at work we are using the mailbox the society want you to use, if you got them on your personal phone it's a particular case), but seriously, what kind of life do you have to get so many emails each day that you don't have time to answer? How important could they be that you need to snooze them? If there are so important just reply! If there are so important, you won't forget! And it's not like emails are going to disappear as soon as you read them. They still will be there, in your mail box. There is no trap. ninjustin I snooze things all the time that come in during the work day I need to handle when I get home or on the weekends. It's also handy in keeping track of when I need to pay my bills. Fruity101079 Clearly, we don't use it the same way. I never have to pay bills through an email. And i get 1 or 2 emails maximum per day. And there are not important. I don't need to snooze anything, i remember what i got. Nicholas Nezis If only Inbox supported a proper signature block, then I would switch over to Inbox 100%. Steve Crane The only time I open Inbox is when I want to clear my Gmail inbox by deferring (snoozing) mails I want to read in the evening or on the weekend. If snoozing was built into Gmail I would have no need for Inbox at all. Kostas 💪🎩 If inbox had a "mark as read and archive" function instead of just archive, I would change in a heartbeat ShahinTr Never got used to Inbox, especially that chat-esque conversation. Gave it so many chances, but I prefer the conventional email application. Also, Gmail has taken a few features from Inbox that have integrated well with it. BanksKillian tie Michel Sa Inbox is my to-do list, and that's all what i need from an email app. CD RW inbox can't leave inbox due to snooze by location (genious idea) and by time Fresh360 Inbox is a great app I love it, I don't know how I functioned on mobile without it but goodness gracious is it disastrous on the desktop so wide, so bright, so cumbersome. So I strictly use Gmail on the desktop, it's weird but the two email program route works the best. Justin Martin Why don't they just put the hangout's functionality in Gmail so you can set it up either way. Again Google putting out multiple apps just like the whole messaging thing. sloheim I've grown to appreciate Inbox (other than the painful slowness of the web version, it is BRUTAL). I just wish it worked with non-gmail accounts. If I could hook up my Office365 account, it would be ideal. CD RW you can you just need to gmailify your account : https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en then inbox will support this account Georg Eitler AOSP Mail. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Neither Chad Knasinski Gmail on the web because it is much faster than Inbox. Inbox for the app for the same reason. Rob Paek Wow, dead even at 43% for Gmail and Inbox! RomiresT Inbox desktop version is killing me. It hangs, lags and dissapoint me in last few month. So, I just switch back to Gmail. kjohnson04 Never could get into using Inbox. Count me in the Gmail camp. Suyash Bansal Inbox on PC and Gmail on phone. grebulon Hop email messanger (https://gethop.com/) is what inbox is unsuccessfully trying to do. SHunter I need Inbox to support Send Money / Request Money just like Gmail does.... kalehv I only use Gmail to reply/forward a specific message in the conversation (thread) Inbox doesn't do that. For Inbox, it's all or none. Garett You can do that now in Inbox :) kalehv haha, apparently yes, that works. Scott Breitbach Inbox, except when I need to search for something specific. rctx81 My main issue with Inbox is that, for the most part of the time, it doesnt seem to obey my previous Gmail filters and labels. I like its snooze/archive functions, but then I ended up using Spark on my MbPro/iPad, fell in love with it and now I cant wait for its Android version. Nowadays I barely touch Inbox on mobile and I try to process as much email as possible from my Mac and iPad. jamez243 Still can't print from within the inbox app... how has this not been fixed anymore? 1966CAH On the desktop- GMail. On my phone- Inbox. David I use both since I need to use gmail to access my college email account. But besides that, Inbox is life ipsofact Inbox all day ! saf1927 I didn't expect that many people preferring Inbox to Gmail. I remember I've only used it for a couple of months only because Gmail didn't have material design yet. Daniel Rodríguez Ycaza Gmail for laptop/desktop and Inbox for cellphone/tablet works for me! Hurricane Andrew I've been using Inbox since it was invite only. It's changed the way I use email, allowing me to keep a nice clean inbox, quickly triage messages, and avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the volume of messages that I get on a daily basis. Jim I've tried Inbox... it's just too much work for me. Gmail works just fine for my needs which is reading regular emails, most of which are sales/marketing and other "subscription" emails. I don't get a lot of personal emails so all that compartmentalizing just got to be way too much to handle. b_boogey_xl After multiple start and fails, I finally realized how to use Inbox and once I discovered that, I haven't looked back. When I use regular email, all I think to myself is how much better the experience would be if I could filter it through Inbox. Ygor Cortes The problem with Inbox is that it only supports Google emails, so Gmail is the way to go for me. Ygor Cortes Inbox's website is miles better than Gmail's though. No competition there. Pedro Diego Fernández I get an email, I read/answer/delete it... done... don't want any "smart" sorting or e-learning algorithm...I don't even use the tabs in gmail that sort email into ads, social media and work... I'll handle my stuff myself... to me the only thing gmails need is an option to schedule an answer, because sometimes I'll sit at night an write the answers and keep them as drafts ti send them in the morning in business hours TheManuz I would use Gmail BUT... Inbox has snooze and that's the only reason I use it. Bruce Wayne What's snooze? keithzg That feature that doesn't work half the time :( CD RW always works 100% of the time for me weird keithzg For me it goes in phases. Unfortunately that means I can never really rely on it. To be clear, snoozing to a time actually always works, but snoozing to a place is infuriatingly broken. TheManuz I don't know if it's the correct name, since I use Inbox in italian. Anyway here's an example: when you receive an email and you think "I don't need it right now, this thing has to be dealt with on friday" and then you click "snooze" and postpone that email on friday, 9:30 AM. The email is gone, and it will come back on friday at the time you chose. Bruce Wayne Ohhh. Nifty feature. CD RW even better you can snooze by location. received a work email when you're at home ? snooze it by location to office. As soon as you arrive at office the mail will come back Maxixou I love Inbox but i use Gmail because Inbox accept only @gmail.com adress ... AlRegals Inbox for work email, Gmail for personal. Bruce Wayne Gmail. Michel S. Inbox on mobile, Gmail on desktop. Colin Richardson Inbox for people who want Automatic groups. Gmail for people who like to set it up themselves. Simples.

While Google’s competitor to the Amazon Alexa devices has been available in the U.S. since November, and in the U.K. since early April, Canada has been a “grey market” zone for the device. As we previously detailed, Google Home devices worked almost as well in Canada as it does in the U.S., save for a couple of niche features. (For example, multi-user support still isn’t available in Canada, and the device doesn’t support shopping.) Related No reason to wait for Google Home to officially arrive in Canada Google Inc. announced that its Google Home speakers were officially launched in the U.K. April 6, but Canada is still waiting. The search giant has promised 2017 access to the smart speaker hardware Published on: April 11th, 2017 Brian Jackson @brianjjackson On Sunday night, both Best Buy Canada and Amazon Canada listed the Google Home device as available to purchase and ship within Canada. Previously, Canadians could order the device from American retailer B&H Photo, but some Reddit users reported that option was no longer available. Amazon.ca lists Google Home as in stock and is priced at $226. Bestbuy.ca lists Google Home as an online-only item and on sale until April 30 for $226.00.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 1 May 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM Smart home assistants need assistance to catch on Despite being a hands-free connection to potentially any element of an individual's digital life, the most popular use for DHAs is currently playing music (63%). — AFP Relaxnews Voice-operated digital home assistants could revolutionise the way we interact with technology and potentially any element of the smart home. However, for the moment at least, their appeal appears to be very limited, as is how they're being used. There's a lot of conversation around voice-activated home assistants, however, according to new data from GfK, there is currently very little conversation actually with devices like Amazon Echo or Google Home. People's comfort levels when it comes to consciously talking to a device have never been higher. Thanks to Apple's Siri and Google Now, 69% of US consumers aged between 13 and 64 say that they have used voice commands to operate their smartphone and 21% use the feature on a tablet. However, when it comes to the new generation of smart home assistants that are being aggressively marketed by Google and Amazon, only 11% of GfK's 1,012 respondent sample said that they currently owned one. Even though they've been on the market for almost two years and are very affordable devices – the Amazon Dot costs just US$49.99 (RM215) in the US – uptake is slow. The current split finds Amazon devices five times more popular than Google's and with just 3% of those surveyed indicating they had a strong intention of buying a digital home assistant (DHA) over the next 12 months, it appears as if Google won't be closing the gap in 2017, at least. Yet, even with comparatively low consumer penetration, trends are already beginning to emerge. Despite being a hands-free connection to potentially any element of an individual's digital life, the most popular use for DHAs is currently playing music (63%). Other popular uses include checking weather and traffic information, keeping up to date with sports results and operating other smart appliances such as lights and thermostats. But within the top 10 list of current uses, ordering products from Amazon is in 10th place, something that is potentially troubling to the online retailer who has a track record of selling devices at cost or even for a small loss in order to earn revenues from a device's connected services. Nevertheless, even at this very early stage of the DHA's life, nearly half (46%) of owners say that they're already using them regularly and 19% claim they use them "all the time". —  AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Super Mario Run to host Mario Kart 8 Deluxe event What to watch out for when buying a USB stick Exercise can be contagious, new social network analysis finds New funding makes China’s Didi ‘most valuable Asian startup’ Britons shun e-books due to ‘screen fatigue’ Why are M'sians investing hard-earned money in Ponzi schemes?

If you want to make sure your kids aren’t watching porn on the Samsung handset you got them, then you are in luck. The manufacturer has a new parental control app confusingly called Samsung Marshmallow. That is similar to Google naming their next build of Android ‘Galaxy’ instead of the widely predicted Oreo. The real goal of the app is to train your kids so that they know when it is the right time to use the phone, and when it is time to put it down. With the app Samsung Marshmallow, kids can develop their own usage plans, with certain fixed targets to achieve on proper smartphone etiquette. With the app, the kids will earn Marshmallow points when they use the phone the right way, but will lose points if they do something wrong. When enough points are accumulated, children can ask their parents for a gift card to use in the gift shop. A child is also eligible to earn Marshmallow points when they use their smartphone properly and loses the points when he does not. A child can set daily smartphone usage limits themselves. Also, parents are allowed to choose apps which they do not want their child to use from the apps installed on the child’s smartphone. Parents can set bedtimes to make sure the child has a good night’s sleep. The Marshmallow mode allows a child to use only 8 apps. Parents can reduce smartphone usage in Marshmallow mode. In a home with Marshmallow, a day’s smartphone usage status is provided. Both the parents and child can check daily and weekly reports for more detailed usage information. Marshmallow also provides badges and extra bonus Marshmallow points when a child observes smartphone usage rules. The Samsung Marshmallow app is available for the Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+, Galaxy S7/S7 Edge, Galaxy S6/S6 Edge/S6 Edge+, Galaxy S5, Note 5, Note 4, Galaxy A5/A7/A8/A9, and the Samsung Galaxy J3/J5/J7.

Google Photos v2.14 is preparing personalized experiences and sharing suggestions based around facial recognition [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 5:08pm PDTApr 26, 2017 67 Plus 1 on G+ 69 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News When the Photos app launched in 2015, Google had already been working on computer vision for many years. It was no surprise that object recognition was a major draw for the app, and automatic sorting of pictures by person with the use of facial recognition became a must-have feature. Google is now looking to leverage this technology to make the Photos app a bit more social. A teardown of the latest Photos update reveals the service will soon offer additional features based around facial recognition, and even encourage users to share pictures with the people detected in them. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Since facial recognition is a sensitive privacy topic, it's worth a quick sanity check to reduce confusion and knee-jerk reactions going into this teardown. Everything discussed here is opt-in and the features will not work if users do not select a photo of themselves, and that means nothing can happen accidentally or without granting permission. Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. I'll leave it up to each reader to determine how they feel about the remaining functions and their practical implications. Face recognition for personalization, sharing, and more Instead of opening with the reason this feature might be useful, I'm going to jump straight to a summary of how Google is going to present it. Quite simply, the Photos app is going to ask users to "personalize" their experience by selecting a picture of themselves from the list of previously identified faces. If you already named yourself, the group might be renamed "Me" after making the selection. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_title">Personalize Google Photos by labeling your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_desc">Which face is yours?</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_picker_face_picker_title">Select your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_confirmation_toast_msg">All set! Try searching for “Me”.</string> Face recognition isn't just the tool, it's actually part of the pitch to get users interested. Google's explanation is broken up into two parts, the first of which offers to reward users for choosing a face with "personalized search, creations, and more." <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc0">Get personalized search, creations, and more based on your face?</string> Personalized search is explained by the toast message above – it just means you can search for "me" to find pictures of yourself. I assume "creations" are the same auto-generated albums, collages, and animations we usually see in the Assistant tab, but obviously focused on you, the user. Both of these sound like things we have now. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc1">Allow your contacts' Google Photos apps to recognize your face in photos for faster sharing? &lt;a href=help:&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;</string> It's the second part of the explanation where things get interesting. If you have identified your face for Google Photos, you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken. To be clear, this can only happen for people if they are in your contact list and if you've given permission for it to make matches.

settings for managing the new facial recognition features, but they are just there to turn the grouping features on and off, or to change the face you selected in the past – perhaps you tapped on the

My biggest question is what users will see after they take a picture of somebody else and a match is made. Primarily, will the photographer be prompted to share the photo, will it quietly include some visual marker that somebody was detected, or will it remain quiet and simply make intelligent suggestions if the share button is pressed? A big feature like this is probably not going to trigger quietly, so I expect notifications, but that could get pretty overwhelming after something like an office party or family reunion. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many unanswered questions, and since the implementation isn't done and there are missing pieces, there aren't going to be answers quite yet. The potential problem for features like this is that they tip-toe right up to the line where many people feel uncomfortable about potential privacy issues. It looks like Google has done a good job of designing barriers to avoid some of those issues, and it's clear users are responsible for making their own decisions. It's important that this is an opt-in feature by default. I do like the idea of using facial recognition to smooth out the rough edges of sharing photos with people, especially if it also acts as a reminder. I admit, I have a bad habit of taking pictures of friends and forgetting to share them later. If this goes well, Google might have the killer feature that turns Photos into a must-use service.

Southern Discomfort Yep, see this as super profitable for the big G. Knows your face, scans all your pictures and notices a slew of recent pictures all showing Best Buy in the background. Guess what shows up in your Gmail inbox within moments...?? Yeah, I don't know. This sounds like the tide turning type of thing and is actually kinda spooky for me. I get that Goog does this type of thing, but dang... Willie Chalmers III I really doubt that's going to happen. It's a slippery slope, and if they wanted to do that, they likely would have done it by now to some extent, and people would notice. James Briano Oh, Google already knows. When I search Drive for "Best Buy" I get a lot of interesting results. Example attached. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/45ff7b47285e47474877510e0456d559a7344aca80b48062d208178aa0e33897.jpg Theo Logian There is likely location data attached to that photo rather than image recognition of that big yellow tag. tik Yup... location based versus recognizing text in the image. trekker Photos face recognition is brilliant - especially when visiting a friend and quickly being able to find photos from the past to enjoy together. However currently they decide who gets a name label (or tag) and this means i have many people who remain unsearchable. Please can we manually add names ourselves? The system where Google provides choices for names does not work. Prosti95 Maybe I misunderstand you, but AFAIK you are able to name them by yourself. trekker Only the faces selected by Google can be named. There are about 300 you have as choices and once they are named there are only many from crowd shots selected which are options. I have many more people from years ago in scanned photos who I would like to name and be able to successfully search for. Currently impossible as there is no manual selection (which was an option in Picasa). whispy_snippet "you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken." Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? If I go to the auto generated "people" album I can see a whole bunch of photos of people clustered via facial recognition. Yes, I had to turn this feature on and individually label people, but the end result is now effectively the same. My app recognises faces. Jens M Eichkorn What's new is that it will associate faces with actual names / Google accounts whispy_snippet Sure, I understand that. But what I'm trying to say is that if a user chooses to do so, they can make Google Photos do this already. The tear down gives the impression that a person needs to opt-in to allow their face to be recognised in images taken by someone else. What I'm saying is that I can already go into my Photos app, enable face recognition, label some faces and bam, I'm getting the same result. This teardown suggests people can soon can opt-in to something that's already effectively live anyway. What seems new is that the process looks more streamlined. But I'd have thought many people would be more concerned with a right to opt-in to facial recognition, not a right to opt-in to a more streamlined process. Am I making sense? I feel like I'm not articulating myself well here. Cody Toombs You're making sense, and perhaps this is a part I could have explained differently, or more completely, maybe? This isn't really the easiest thing to explain, especially with so many missing pieces. Anyway, here's the main difference as far as I can tell right now: In its current state, facial recognition occurs in the cloud with all of the pictures you've taken and matching faces are placed into groups. These groups can then be named. You obviously know that part. The thing about these face matchings is they don't exist beyond your account, nor do they actually correlate to your contact list or social graph. The real world comparison would be that you've been handed a stack of photos and asked to find all the instances of a random face, put them in a stack, then put a post-it note on top of it with a random name. I believe this isn't considered a privacy issue (except in Europe) because it's all based on data that belongs to you. This new feature performs the same matching, but it uses an image (or maybe many images) belonging to somebody else to perform the matches, even if those images never actually reach you. Google is still transmitting some information to you that relates to another person, even if it's only to confirm that there's a match and it's somebody that has you in their contact list. Additionally, and this part is super unclear at this stage (I kinda avoided bringing it up in the post for obvious reasons), we don't know if Google will transmit any additional information, which may include the person's name or some sort of contact details to make it possible to share the photo. For example, this might explain why some stuff related to Google+ contacts turned up in the last teardown of Photos (link). I personally don't worry about these things, but some people obviously do, and that's why users should give permission for it to happen. whispy_snippet Thanks very much for the explanation, Cody. Much appreciated. I guess any analysis based on incomplete information is always going to be a tough game to play. You obviously have the disclaimer at the start of each APK teardown for a reason! We'll just have to wait and see how it all plays out. As a general rule I'm definitely not the type to get paranoid or concerned about Google having mountains of data on me. I use just about every Google service there is, including Google Photos, and love the trade off​ of my data for web services. But yeah, many people do get concerned about these things and I can respect their position. I try to keep in touch with both sides of the fence on these discussions. Cody Toombs When I started writing this post, I thought back to the post we had about Nearby a couple of years ago. It was written correctly and honestly, but somehow it was picked up by some news organizations with a particular political slant and we were inundated by people that took a very extreme, very negative standpoint about the idea of Nearby. I wanted to cut that off and prevent undue outrage. I'm not sure if I overcorrected or not, but the response has been mostly neutral, so at least I feel like it was handled fairly. whispy_snippet I think you guys get it right. As far as I can tell AP has a very, very strong reputation in the tech community. Sometimes there's not a lot you can do if someone has an agenda they want to fulfill! JG Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? From the article: Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. whispy_snippet Ah yep, I must have missed that bit. Well it makes sense. But yeah, I guess my other key question still stands - why is there a need to give people the option to opt-in to something that's effectively out of their hands? Your face can already be recognised in someone else's Google Photos "people" album. David Hyman What if it knew you were together and it automatically shared the pictures with other people. Basically automatically creating a shared album Paul_Werner I'd love that Mark Dodsworth Automatic sharing is never a good thing, I'm sure that the shared album thing is going to happen. One of the guys in charge of Google Photos was behind this app: https://vimeo.com/46398388 Mark Dodsworth If you want to see more about how the above app worked here's a video: https://youtu.be/0T9Ii37yuKw it used location to match people in shared albums. I bet location sharing will be added to facial recognition in Google Photos. Cody Toombs I tend to agree with Mark. Automation is good, but when it involves sharing potentially private data, things can get harry really fast. I would want the app to ask my permission before sharing anything with somebody else. Just think of all the backlash Facebook received when people started discovering there had been intentional loopholes to allow things to become more public than they were intended to be. Kevfromspace Any news on printing Google Photos albums a la Apple Photos Books? Cody Toombs You know, something about that did turn up last year in August (link), but I haven't seen any activity on it since. I think the couple of things related to that were also removed, so it may have been scrapped or placed on a backburner for now. Kevfromspace Damnit! Ever since I read that original teardown post last year I've been waiting patiently, hoping I could print an album of a trip I did with my girlfriend before her birthday this June. Looking more unlikely by the day. Cody Toombs It would be cool if Google opened up an API to Photos so print shops could work with people independently. Google itself shouldn't have to do the printing, but it would be neat if somebody could. sodsavage Or just better printing options in general, theres next to none right now. Some of us still do like prints of our photos, smh. rickneworleansla I've been wondering about this also. Currently I have to download then re-upload to a photo printing service. Seems like google could make some money by mailing out photos, digital DVD copies, movies, etc. Their current full album download process is terrible and failed the three times I tried. I probably have too many photos. The files were huge. tik Definitely excited with all of the new updates. But, at the same time, it'd be great if Google Photos could... - Batch edit pictures - Batch remove pictures/albums from Google Photos (instead of the 1500 picture limit) - Batch download pictures to device Si vis pacem, para bellum The feature I am waiting for the most is some damn basic drawing tool while editing a photo... Basicly that's why I am still using the Samsung default gallery as my primary gallery app on both my smartphone and tablet. oningam about face recognition I would like to force it on some contacts that for some reason are not picked up or they are only at a later time. Also I'd like to get a numeric badge on each thumb to know the number of images in it and also a way to know if there are new association because quite frequently I have to go trough all of them and remove wrong matches on already identified people. About editing I'm still waiting for a way to modify date and insert position on single and batch of selected pictures. DavidB23 Agree 100% on all counts. An easy way to edit the dates in batch or one at a time is at the top of my list of improvements Ibrahim Yusuf A feature that Europe won't get 😑 Mark Dodsworth That's the thing I worry about seeing this, a pretty huge feature to miss out on. Tomáš Petrík If at least they made it opt-in, so that I could willingly enable that... Markoff As European I am fine with that actually. Ibrahim Yusuf I'm glad that Europe has these privacy laws, but I want to have the choice to opt-in to some of these features even if I sacrifices some of my privacy abdullah ibdah Really?! You would actually sacrifice your privacy for some features ?! osullz I think it's bizarre that I still can't search for photos with the phrase 'Person X AND Person Y' or ask the Google Assistant to "show me photos of Person X AND Person Y." Facebook's Knowledge Graph is able to do that much and Google surely could as well. Mark Dodsworth I do those searches in Google Photos all the time, you can separate names by comma or and. osullz Well go figure. The day I posted this it wouldn't do anything except for say there were no results but now it of course does it no problem. Urmil Shroff Damn, Photos is getting cooler and cooler. Markoff indeed, was fan of 3rd party galleries like Piktures, but gave up having Photos in phone just for online backup and Piktures for viewing photos, when they pushed video stabilizing update, tne I just got rid off Piktures on mine and wives phone as well though I am not fan of providing facial data to google, so I am not using this feature Ola Stensson So are they EVER gonna launch the face feature at all outside the US? I think it's been two years now... jeremylea I still wish they would tag bad photos and suggest automatically deleting them... For an AI, detecting pictures of fingers, carpets, ceilings, motion blur, all black, all white, etc., etc., should be easy, and the training sample is already there - just look in people's trash. Al Ked One thing I wish they'd add is de-duplication. Backing stuff up from a few different sources I always end up with some duplicates. It would be cool if it found them out and allowed me to remove the duplicates.

A hard-hitting report accused major firms of putting more effort into protecting their profits than keeping the public safe online. Ministers should consider forcing firms to pay for the cost of policing on social media and introducing a system of sanctions with multimillion-pound fines, the Home Affairs Select Committee said. The cross-party committee, which took evidence from Google, Facebook and Twitter, acknowledged that the technology giants had considered the impact that online hate, abuse and extremism can have on individuals and welcomed measures taken to tackle the problem. But they said "nowhere near enough is being done". The committee said it had found "repeated examples of social media companies failing to remove illegal content when asked to do so", including "dangerous" terrorist recruitment material, promotion of sexual abuse of children and incitement to racial hatred. The report said: "The biggest companies have been repeatedly urged by Governments, police forces, community leaders and the public to clean up their act, and to respond quickly and proactively to identify and remove illegal content. They have repeatedly failed to do so. "That should not be accepted any longer. Social media is too important to everyone - to communities, individuals, the economy and public life - to continue with such a lax approach to dangerous content that can wreck lives. "And the major social media companies are big enough, rich enough and clever enough to sort this problem out - as they have proved they can do in relation to advertising or copyright. "It is shameful that they have failed to use the same ingenuity to protect public safety and abide by the law as they have to protect their own income." In their strongly-worded report, the MPs accused Google, which owns YouTube, of making money from hatred because adverts appear alongside "inappropriate and unacceptable content, some of which were created by terrorist organisations" - with the creators of the extreme content also getting a share of the revenue. Although some advertisers had withdrawn their business from the site and Google may suffer financially as a result, "the most salient fact is that one of the world's largest companies has profited from hatred and has allowed itself to be a platform from which extremists have generated revenue". The MPs said it was "unacceptable" that social media companies relied on users to report content, claiming the firms were "outsourcing" the role "at zero expense" while expecting the police - funded by the taxpayer - to bear the costs of keeping their platforms and reputations "clean of extremism". They suggested a similar model to that used in football, where clubs are obliged to pay for policing around their stadiums on match days, urging ministers to consult on requiring social media firms to contribute to the cost of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism internet referral unit (CTIRU). They also suggested considering "meaningful fines" for social media companies which fail to remove illegal content within a strict timeframe, highlighting proposals in Germany which could see firms fined up to £44 million and individual executives £5 million. The committee's Labour chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: "Social media companies' failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace. "They have been asked repeatedly to come up with better systems to remove illegal material such as terrorist recruitment or online child abuse. Yet repeatedly, they have failed to do so. It is shameful." Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she expects to see social media companies take "early and effective action" and promised to study the committee's recommendations. "We have made it very clear that we will not tolerate the internet being used as a place for terrorists to promote their vile views, or use social media platforms to weaponise the most vulnerable people in our communities," she said. "Last month I convened a meeting with the social media companies to ask them to go further in making sure this kind of harmful material is not available on their platforms, and an industry-led forum has now been set up to more robustly address this. "We will continue to push the internet companies to make sure they deliver on their commitments to further develop technical tools to identify and remove terrorist propaganda and to help smaller companies to build their capabilities. I expect to see early and effective action." NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said whoever wins the June 8 general election needs to introduce regulation for social networks to protect children online: "Online safety is one of the biggest risks facing children and young people today and one which government needs to tackle head on. "The suffering experienced by children – often with devastating consequences for them and their families – shows that relying on voluntary regulations developed by internet companies is not enough." 1 May 2017 12:30AM View comments Most Commented Bird feeding, begging and spitting could be banned from Carlisle 6 Inspirational teen battling bowel cancer in awareness raising fight 4 Keith Curle concedes Carlisle Utd have had to deal with too many injuries this season 3 'Fish Finger' to challenge Cumbrian MP in election 3 Police appeal after young man targeted in disability hate crime attack in town centre 2 Most Read Efforts to bring Cumbrian factory fire under control continue Inspirational teen battling bowel cancer in awareness raising fight Girls, 14, arrested after arson attack in Cumbrian town centre Murderer was central figure in Carlisle pub brawl Tributes to Cumbria wildlife worker who died taking part in fell race More news   Sir Tom Jones Rules change for Cumbria's The Voice auditions Middlesbrough boss Steve Agnew is convinced his side can still beat the drop Steve Agnew won't stop believing Middlesbrough can beat the threat of relegation Jose Mourinho's Manchester United were frustrated by Swansea on Sunday Marcus Rashford accused of deceiving referee by Swansea boss Paul Clement Mark Selby won the last three frames of the night to get a foothold back into the World Championship final Mark Selby's title hopes lifted by late rally against John Higgins Anthony Joshua, right, stopped Wladimir Klitschko in 11 rounds at Wembley Stadium Joshua keen to face 'a real villain' as heavyweight champ weighs up next move Quick searches Carlisle Airport Carlisle United Court cases Cumberland Infirmary Sellafield West Cumberland Hospital Featured articles   Paul and Wendy Booth Still no end in sight for those whose home is just a shell Saturn as viewed from the Cassini spacecraft.

Earlier this year, Google confirmed an Android 7.1.2 Nougat update for its Pixel and Nexus-branded devices. In early April, Google pulled the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 Nougat update from beta and began rolling it out to owners around the world. Android 7.1.2 Nougat isn’t as big as Android 7.1.1 or Android 7.0 but it’s an important update for the Nexus 5X. The Android 7.1.2 update is primarily focused on improving performance but the Nexus 5X’s Android 7.1.2 Nougat upgrade also comes with some brand new features including a useful fingerprint scanner gesture. Its been three weeks since Google released the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 Nougat update and today we’re looking at how the upgrade has progressed and/or regressed during that time span. We also want to take a look at some of the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 problems that’ve popped up since release including one that appears to be plaguing more than a few owners. On top of that, this roundup outlines a few things to expect from Google moving forward including the cutoff date for major Nexus 5X Android updates. Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 Nougat Review   1 / 7 Before we get into our quick Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 review, a few notes about the installation and download process.  The Nexus 5X's Android 7.1.2 Nougat update is several hundred megabytes. It only took us a couple of minutes to download over a high-speed Wi-Fi network but the installation took a bit longer.  The installation took around 10 minutes or so to complete. Note: If you've skipped any of the monthly security updates, you'll need to download those before you can download the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update OTA. We recommend putting aside 15-20 minutes to monitor the Android 7.1.2 download and installation. We didn't run into any problems but there's always a chance you might.  We've been using the update for about three weeks now and Android 7.1.2 is still performing well on our Nexus 5X.  Battery life is excellent. We haven't noticed any weird drain during our time with the new software. Connectivity is also strong and we haven't noticed any issues with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cellular data.  The phone's user interface is still extremely fast. That's important for a device that was first released all the way back in 2015. Hard to believe its been that long since launch.  We haven't run into any bugs or serious problems with our version of Android 7.1.2. We've been hearing and seeing complaints about the fingerprint sensor but ours is working properly. Given what's on board (security patches, new features, bug fixes) and given its steady performance, you'll definitely want to consider installing Android 7.1.2 on your Nexus 5X.  If you're having a pleasant experience on Android 7.1.1 Nougat or below, be sure to take your time. Dig into additional feedback if you start feeling leery. We've put together a list of reasons to, and not to, install Android 7.1.2. It could help you to one side of the fence or the other.    1 / 7 12 Responses 04/05/2017 Joe Reply I encountered some serious problems with 7.1.2 on my Nexus 6P, so much so that I had to roll back to 7.1.1. Furthermore, when I rolled back, I repeatedly saw dialog boxes telling me that a system app (I think something with the word “core” in the name) had crashed; every time I’d dismiss one, another would pop up. I had to do a factory reset to eliminate the problem. Anyway, the problems I experienced with 7.1.2 were: no notification (status) bar; no ability to access Quick Settings or notifications except from the home screen; the background, text, and icons in Quick Settings were all white, making them nearly unreadable (fortunately, the text/icons and background were a slightly different shade of white from each other!); USB audio was broken, resulting in my USB audio interface crashing my USB audio applications. 04/06/2017 sohil shriyan Reply since the update my phone has continued crashing and rebooting automatically every 5 mins or so and it doesnt even restart its just the whole thing wherein the colorful circles go round and round this is post the google sign and before the android sign. Reset my phone to factory settings but the issue still persists. kindly advise on a solution to this. 04/07/2017 MrAndroid Reply You will need to re-flash the device. Check out the wugfresh Nexus Root Toolkit. It can help you re-flash your device to factory fresh images. 04/07/2017 Ajay Goel Reply I need some help !! Since the time my phone updated to 7.1.1, I have been facing a problem. While everything else is working fine, internet works only on a Wi-Fi network but not on my mobile data network. I have shown it everywhere possible but am still facing this problem. Ajay Goel India 04/07/2017 Eli Reply My 5x has a decreased Bluetooth performance since the update. I have a Garmin Fenix 3 watch that would always reconnect when it came back into range with the phone. After the update, the connection reattempts are much less frequent and sometimes it will not reconnect until the phone is rebooted. The was no update to the Fenix. Additionally, using Bluetooth in my car results in studdering audio until I turn the WiFi off. 04/07/2017 Ian Fuller Reply My Nexus 5x was recently updated, and immediately after the initial boot it went into a boot loop. Luckily I did a hard restart and it booted just fine. Otherwise the update has been great. Good battery life, no studders, and no connectivity problems. 04/07/2017 Kuruvilla Eapen Reply Yes, it’s just working fine, love the Nexus 5x like always. Seems to be a bit more smoother with the update. 04/07/2017 Swap Reply Poor article. No substantial information provided. 04/08/2017 Gauruv Grover Reply My Nexus 5x got stuck in Bootloop 4 days after updating to 7.1.2. Please be careful while updating yours. 04/09/2017 A Got Reply The update rendered my phone useless, causing it to go into a restart loop. LG is not taking care of me, and google is doing nothing either. This is why people buy apple. I’ve never owned an apple product. I will never buy another google product. 04/15/2017 lakawak Reply IT is causing a severe battery drain on mine. Like 3% every hour with the phone simply on and not being used at all. Not even the screen on. I have a very bare bones set up..cell daa turned off. No Bluetooth, NO push notifications..nothing. Before the update, with my usual light use (still more than not where it is draining 2-3% an hour) it would drain about 20% a day. Now it is up to 60-70% a day with NO use. They want me to do a factory reset. Not sure what good it will do since it will immediately want to update. So I would be stuck with either the very old one, or the new one that is causing the problem entirely. It isn’t as if it will let me only install the last one that worked fine. And since I don’t sync my phone, it would be a huge pain in the ass 04/30/2017 Jennifer Reply This update bricked my 11-month-old Nexus 5X this afternoon. We couldn’t even get it to hard restart. Fortunately it was still under the Google warranty, so a refurbished replacement is on the way. I won’t be installing this update on the replacement, and my husband and mother have been warned not to install it on their phones (at least not until bugs are worked out). Someone above mentioned Apple products. I dug out my 3.5-year-old iPhone (my second iPhone, and no problems with either) and inserted my Project Fi SIM card from the Nexus brick so that I wouldn’t be left phone-less. It works just fine, as do my 4.5-year-old MacBook and 5-year-old iPad that I used to contact Google with this issue. Google/LG would do well to take notice. I’ll use the replacement Nexus, but between this and the problems with Samsung, my next new phone will be from Apple. The hardware is far better.

By: Reuters | Published: April 28, 2017 5:56 PM Google’s search for non-ad revenue puts spotlight on cloud, Pixel. (Reuters) Alphabet Inc’s non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones, and the Play store, has long been sandwiched between Google’s advertising juggernaut and its moonshot ventures that have captured popular imagination. Not anymore. The business, categorized as “Other Revenue” in its earnings report, posted a 49.4 percent jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday – a sum already bigger than Twitter Inc’s annual revenue. The business now represents about 13 percent of Alphabet’s total revenue, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but definitely shines a light on Google’s efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc. “(Google) is doing a good job, a much better job in diversifying revenue than Facebook is,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. “We think that is quite an impressive achievement.” Alphabet does not break out revenue contribution within the “Other Revenue” segment. But analysts have said that cloud is the most prominent among the category’s clutch of businesses. To be sure, Google’s cloud venture is still much smaller than market leader Amazon.com Inc’s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp’s Azure. But Google is investing heavily. “In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in cloud,” Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Also watch: Amazon’s cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft’s cloud unit grew 93 percent. “We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google’s hardware products, we see Google’s ‘other’ revenue growing 38 percent to nearly $14 billion in 2017,” Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note. The company’s hardware business also started gaining traction after Google released a pair of high-profile hardware products last year – the Pixel phone and the Google Home, a smart speaker like Amazon’s Echo. “People are hankering for a really awesome Android phone that basically gives them the iPhone experience,” Wang said, adding that the growth in Google’s “other revenue” bucket this quarter “shows sustained momentum for the Pixel.” Still, the lion’s share of Alphabet’s revenue comes from ads and that’s not going to change anytime soon. Total advertising revenue increased 18.8 percent to $21.1 billion in the first quarter, the company reported on Thursday. Profit also rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, beating Wall Street estimates. At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after the earnings report. Alphabet’s drive for diversification also includes its “Other Bets” business, considered the company’s loss-making arm. The business, home to the Waymo self-driving car, Google Fiber and thermostat-maker Nest, posted a first-quarter loss of $855 million. Google’s shares were up 4 percent in premarket trading on Friday. They have gained 12.5 percent this year. No Comments.

Social media companies are putting profit before safety and should face fines of tens of millions of pounds for failing to remove extremist and hate crime material promptly from their websites, MPs have said. The largest and richest technology firms are “shamefully far” from taking action to tackle illegal and dangerous content, according to a report by the Commons home affairs committee. The inquiry, launched last year following the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right gunman, concludes that social media multinationals are more concerned with commercial risks than public protection. Swift action is taken to remove content found to infringe copyright rules, the MPs note, but a “laissez-faire” approach is adopted when it involves hateful or illegal content. Referring to Google’s failure to prevent paid advertising from reputable companies appearing next to YouTube videos posted by extremists, the committee’s report said: “one of the world’s largest companies has profited from hatred and has allowed itself to be a platform from which extremists have generated revenue”. In Germany, the report points out, the justice ministry has proposed imposing financial penalties of up to €50m on social media companies that are slow to remove illegal content. “Social media companies currently face almost no penalties for failing to remove illegal content,” the MPs conclude. “We recommend that the government consult on a system of escalating sanctions, to include meaningful fines for social media companies which fail to remove illegal content within a strict timeframe.” During its investigation, the committee found instances of terror recruitment videos for banned jihadi and neo-Nazi groups remaining accessible online even after MPs had complained about them. Some of the material included antisemitic, hate-crime attacks on MPs that had been the subject of a previous committee report. Material encouraging child abuse and sexual images of children was also not removed, despite being reported on by journalists. Social media companies that fail to proactively search for and remove illegal content should pay towards costs of the police doing so, the report recommends, just as football clubs are obliged to pay for policing in their stadiums and surrounding areas on match days. The government, the report says, should consider whether failure to remove illegal material is in itself a crime and, if not, how the law should be strengthened. The thrust of the committee’s arguments suggest social media companies need to be treated as though they are traditional publishers. Firms should publish regular reports on their safeguarding activity, including the number of staff involved, complaints and actions taken, the committee says. It is “completely irresponsible” that social media companies are failing to tackle illegal and dangerous content and to implement even their own community standards, the report adds. A thorough review is required of the legal framework controlling online hate speech, abuse and extremism to ensure that the law is up to date, the MPs conclude. “What is illegal offline should be illegal – and enforced – online.” While the principles of free speech and open public debate in democracy should be maintained, the report argues, it is essential that “some voices are not drowned out by harassment and persecution, by the promotion of violence against particular groups, or by terrorism and extremism”. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the home affairs committee, said: “Social media companies’ failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace. “They have been asked repeatedly to come up with better systems to remove illegal material such as terrorist recruitment or online child abuse. Yet repeatedly they have failed to do so. It is shameful. “These are among the biggest, richest and cleverest companies in the world, and their services have become a crucial part of people’s lives. This isn’t beyond them to solve, yet they are failing to do so. They continue to operate as platforms for hatred and extremism without even taking basic steps to make sure they can quickly stop illegal material, properly enforce their own community standards, or keep people safe … “It is blindingly obvious that they have a responsibility to proactively search their platforms for illegal content, particularly when it comes to terrorist organisations.” Google, the parent company of YouTube, told the inquiry that it has plans to extend its “trusted flagger” programme to identify terrorist propaganda and would invest in improving its alert procedures. It said that it “no interest” in making money from extremist material. Facebook also told MPs that it is is reviewing how it handles violent videos and other objectionable material after a video of a murder in the United States remained on its service for more than two hours. Google, Facebook and Twitter all refused to tell the committee how many staff they employ to monitor and remove inappropriate content.

 Read Larry Page's new letter about the current status of Alphabet, Google's parent company Dave Smith Apr. 27, 2017, 1:26 PM 15,830 facebook linkedin twitter email print Larry Page.Andrew Kelly/Reuters Almost two years ago, Google announced it would change its name to Alphabet, which would effectively be a holding company for Google and its various businesses — YouTube, Android, etc. — as well as Google's moonshots factory, X, its investment arms, and more. In a letter to Alphabet shareholders on Thursday, CEO Larry Page, a Google cofounder, said Alphabet was "working well" in overseeing and guiding its companies and that "there's a lot more to come." Page provided updates on Alphabet's projects and companies, but there wasn't much talk about Google itself, aside from some compliments for Google CEO Sundar Pichai and his various undertakings, such as getting machine learning and artificial intelligence into more consumer products like smartphones and smart-home devices. While Page didn't announce any news in this letter, it provides an interesting bird's-eye view of Alphabet's projects and how far they've come in the past year-plus. He emphasized Alphabet's self-driving-car company, Waymo, which has recently been embroiled in legal and technological battles with Uber as both companies pursue similar automated-chauffeur services. Page didn't mention Waymo's competition but shared his excitement about its eventual launch. Here's Page's full letter to Alphabet shareholders: "A is for Alphabet" Hard to believe we are about a quarter short of two years of announcing Alphabet. It's been busy! I certainly feel Alphabet is working well, and as intended (see the original "G is for Google" announcement). At the time, I wrote that "Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence." The new structure has helped entrepreneurs build and run companies with the autonomy and speed they need. Sergey and I are working well together on the overall Alphabet direction and providing guidance to the companies. Sundar is doing great as Google CEO. It's certainly a big job and we are very lucky to have him. He'll probably write this letter again in the future as he has in the past, so I won't speak too much for him on the Google related topics in this one. But, I'm excited about how he is leading the company with a focus on machine learning and AI. We took a big step in that direction with the Google Assistant, and built it into a new family of hardware devices like the Pixel and Google Home. There's a lot more to come. We've had a number of significant things happen on the Alphabet side since I last wrote. A number of our projects became companies, with more autonomy and dedicated leadership. Waymo is the new self-driving car company formed from Project Chauffeur at X. John Krafcik is the new CEO and brings significant auto industry experience. I love the name and I love even more the excitement you can see when you visit with them! They also formed a partnership with Fiat Chrysler around their new plug-in hybrid Pacifica minivan which I see driving around the Waymo offices with lots of sensors on it. I can't wait until Waymo launches. Verily Life Sciences launched in December 2015 with Andy Conrad as founding CEO, also coming out of X. They have launched myriad efforts and raised $800M from Temasek, who joined their board and will help with Asian expansion. I'm very fond of their Debug project, which aims to stop mosquitoes in their tracks. It has been running for a while, showing some good foresight because it was started before Zika became a big concern. In June 2016, Marwan Fawaz became CEO of Nest. He has been doing great against their plan, and we have really been enjoying working with him! I recommend you buy all their excellent products including indoor and outdoor cameras, learning thermostats, and smoke alarms. Very recently Greg McCray started as CEO of Google Fiber. I've been enjoying working with him and his team and he has rapidly been getting up to speed. He visited all of our Fiber cities so quickly that I think he was still a bit out of breath when he got back to Mountain View! We have made significant investments in bringing gigabit fiber internet to lots of happy customers and I'm excited about our opportunities to do it better. We have many other efforts within Alphabet. Calico CEO Art Levinson, former CEO of Genentech, is building an amazing research and development company focused on aging. We also have newly branded investment arms, GV (formerly Google Ventures), and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital) which are doing well. Sergey is continuing to spend time working with the X moonshot factory. They have a number of efforts like Wing, which is doing drone delivery. I also can't wait for them to launch! With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility. We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down. I also think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success. Our recent launch of Waymo was a great example of our learnings. In general we are taking a patient approach to investing our capital, especially significant uses. We're not going to invest if we don't see great opportunities and we feel like our track record for picking some important efforts long before others is pretty good. Machine learning and all the efforts around Google Brain and Deepmind are good examples. Google Cloud led by Diane Greene is doing a fabulous job of getting our machine learning hardware and software out to everyone. We were early in machine learning and are already seeing significant dividends coming out. Many of the Alphabet companies are already using this technology and are planning to use it even more. So in conclusion, Sergey and I are having a good time looking for new opportunities and managing and scaling our existing efforts. I still see amazing opportunities that just aren't quite fully developed yet—and helping making them real is what I get excited about. Get the latest Google stock price here.

It's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service - one that could undercut Google's growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet's first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues.  YouTube's inability to keep big-brand ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google's digital family into a problem child, although it's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service THE AD BOYCOTT  Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen.    Major advertisers didn't start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. However, it was good news for Alphabet Inc's non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store. It has long been sandwiched between Google's advertising juggernaut and its moonshot ventures that have captured popular imagination. Not any more. The business, categorized as 'Other Revenue' in its earnings report, posted a 49.4 percent jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday - a sum already bigger than Twitter Inc's annual revenue. The business now represents about 13 percent of Alphabet's total revenue, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but definitely shines a light on Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc. The company's earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion.  Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday's extended trading. 'In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in cloud,' Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Amazon's cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft's cloud unit grew 93 percent. 'We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google's hardware products, we see Google's 'other' revenue growing 38 percent to nearly $14 billion in 2017,' Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note.

Share this article Share However, it was good news for Alphabet Inc's non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store. The company's hardware business also started gaining traction after Google released a pair of high-profile hardware products last year - the Pixel phone and the Google Home, a smart speaker like Amazon's Echo. But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year.  Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. 'There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person,' says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had 'thousands and thousands' of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. 'They don't want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don't have to because they have many other choices.' Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had 'thousands and thousands' of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands.  'We are evolving overall to a better place,' Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing 'extraordinary' growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won't leave a huge dent in Alphabet's earnings.  That's because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company's golden goose - Google's dominant search engine.  Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet's revenue even as it expands into other fields. Experts say the results show Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc, are working But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. Before the boycott began, YouTube's ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. 'This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand,' says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.)  The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube.  FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. This Wednesday, April 26, 2017, photo shows the Google mobile phone icon, in Philadelphia. Alphabet Inc., parent company of Google, reports financial results, Thursday, April 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. 'It's going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away,' he said. 'There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term.' Investors, however, apparently aren't too worried so far. YouTube's financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google's ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet's net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

Alphabet reported a 29 percent jump in quarterly profit to $5.4 billion, while revenue jumped 22 percent compared with a year ago to $24.75 billion. “Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017,” chief financial officer Ruth Porat said. “We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet.” The Google segment delivered the overwhelming majority of revenues for the company — or $24.5 billion. The so-called “other bets,” which include smart home devices, self-driving cars and life sciences, took in $244 million in revenue but delivered an operating loss of $855 million, Alphabet said. The stronger-than-expected results helped lift Alphabet shares more than four percent in after-hours trade on Wall Street. The results did not appear to show a major impact of an ad boycott of Google’s YouTube earlier this year after revelations that programmed ads were placed alongside videos showing hateful content. Porat told a conference call that “YouTube revenues continued to grow at a significant rate driven primarily by video advertising.” Overall ad revenues for Google rose 19 percent to $21.4 billion in the quarter. Google has promised new efforts to match advertisers with appropriate content, using artificial intelligence, in response to complaints. Sundar Pichai, chief of Google, cited “fantastic momentum” for a variety of products including its Google Assistant, the smart home device that competes with Amazon’s Alexa-powered speakers. Pichai said the device is one element in a strategy focusing on artificial intelligence, or machine learning. “Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products better,” he said. – A patient approach –   Company co-founder and chief executive Larry Page said in a letter to shareholders Thursday he is pleased with the direction under the new corporate structure, which separates Google from its “moonshot” operations. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” he wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down. I also think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success.” Page added that “we are taking a patient approach to investing our capital, especially significant uses. We’re not going to invest if we don’t see great opportunities and we feel like our track record for picking some important efforts long before others is pretty good.” He said the company is benefitting from efforts on artificial intelligence developed by the Google Brain and DeepMind operations. “We were early in machine learning and are already seeing significant dividends coming out,” he said. “Many of the Alphabet companies are already using this technology and are planning to use it even more.” He said he and co-founder Sergey Brin “are having a good time looking for new opportunities and managing and scaling our existing efforts.” Under its new structure, Alphabet is seeking to expand beyond its role as a search engine that provides advertising linked to queries. Last year, Google took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching premium-priced, in-house designed Pixel smartphones and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence (AI) prowess. The group also is selling its Google Assistant which aims to compete with Amazon’s Alexa-powered devices as a hub for the smart home, and has been working to become the platform for some connected cars.-AFP Tagged google United States YouTube Post navigation Previous Previous post: Habits that will make your children independent !!!

By Asha McLean | May 1, 2017 -- 01:35 GMT (18:35 PDT) | Topic: Tech Industry Google Australia has confirmed that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is chasing it for a debt relating to unpaid tax, noting it will "lodge an objection" against the amended income tax assessments it was issued at year-end. "Such contingencies relate to reviews for open tax years as well as certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business," the company wrote in a filing to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Latest Australian news AFP 'mistakenly' accessed journalist call records, breaching metadata laws 136 complaints arise from ATO's string of HPE hardware outages NBN should increase FttP and FttDP connections: SA government Kickass torrents blocked in Australia under Universal ruling Telstra 'staff error' continues plaguing SSU compliance "The company will continue to uphold its positions against any and all such claims. "The company will lodge an objection and make a payment to the Commissioner of Taxation to stay recovery action, consistent with the Australian Taxation Office's practice." Google admitted back in 2015 it was being audited by the ATO for tax avoidance. At the time, former Google Australia managing director and now ANZ group executive of Digital Banking Maile Carnegie said the majority of the company's taxes were paid in the US, because that is where the global headquarters is based; where the company generates the most investment in research and development; and where it undertakes the most risk. "The explanation for why an Australian multinational, whether they be in mining or in biotech, is able to generate the majority of their revenue outside of Australia but pay the majority of their taxes inside of Australia is that the Australian-based headquarters does most of the investment and carries most of the risk," she told a Senate inquiry into tax avoidance. "That explanation is also why Google pays most of its taxes in our US headquarters, because the US headquarters is where the majority of our costs are borne." Google was also previously called out by the federal government for employing the so-called Double Irish Dutch Sandwich method, which is the process of funnelling money through other countries from Australia in order to pay a lower tax rate. During the 2016 calendar year, the local arm of the search engine giant paid just shy of AU$40.6 million in tax, with its financial statement indicating income tax payable during the year was AU$32.9 million -- more than double the AU$16 million tax it paid in 2015. For the 12-months ending December 31, 2016, Google Australia made AU$105 million in after-tax profit, up from AU$47 million the previous year. It was revealed in December that for the 2014-15 financial year, Google, in addition to Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft, upped the amount of tax they paid in Australia over the year prior. According to the ATO 2014-15 Corporate Tax Transparency report, Google handed over AU$12 million in tax after earning AU$439 million in 2014-15. The principal activities of Google Australia during the financial year were to sell advertising and information management technology services and related products, as well as to provide services, assistance, and advice in connection with marketing and sales support for web search engine services and advertising services, the ASIC filing indicated. Effective from January 1, 2016, the company restructured its business such that it recognised revenue from the selling of certain services and products to Australian-based customers. Revenue from these operations came in at just over AU$1.14 billion for the year -- a year on year increase of AU$644 million. Gross profit was AU$442 million, with operating expenses totalling AU$324 million -- comprised mainly of AU$228 million in sales and marketing expenses -- for the year. Prior to 2016, Google Australia undertook marketing and sales support activities on behalf of a related entity and earned a service fee as a result. The local arm has therefore attributed its revenue increase to the restructure of the company from a service entity to a reseller and service entity. Additionally, the company provides research and development (R&D) support for Google technologies and charges Google Inc for services. The Australian government legislated a new Diverted Profits Tax (DPT) in March, which is intended to prevent the practice of multinational organisations shifting profits made in Australia offshore to avoid paying tax. The DPT will hit multinationals with global revenue of more than AU$1 billion and Australian revenue of greater than AU$25 million with a 40 percent tax on all profits. Slated to commence on July 1, 2017, the new tax is expected to see AU$100 million in revenue per year -- from 2018-19 -- stay on Australian soil. The new legislation mirrors one implemented in the United Kingdom, nicknamed the Google Tax after the search engine giant was ordered to pay the UK government £130 million in back taxes. During the fiscal year, Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google Australia, reported $94.8 billion in revenue. For the 12 months to December 31, 2016, Alphabet posted net income of $20.7 billion.

By CaitlinHuston Reporter Shares of Alphabet Inc. were up 5% midday Friday, a day after the company beat first-quarter earnings expectations, and as many Wall Street analysts followed by raising price targets. Google sites led Alphabet Inc.’s earnings as the primary driver of revenue and many analysts see greater revenue growth ahead, coming from added advertising streams as well as Google’s YouTube site. But there is concern that Google’s traffic acquisition costs (TAC) as a percentage of revenue will continue to increase. Shares of Alphabet GOOGL, +3.71%  have gained 10.4% in the past three months, compared with the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.19%   gain of 3.9%. See also: Google survives YouTube ad controversy for now The average stock price target of the 46 analysts surveyed by FactSet increased to $1,031.36 on Friday, or about 9.4% above current levels, from an average of $982.26 before earnings were released. Here’s what analysts said: • Despite the earnings beat, Wedbush analysts are concerned about growing pressure from the sites’ traffic-acquisition costs. Alphabet’s TAC as a percentage of sites revenue increased this quarter, the analysts said, and in the future management said it expects the overall percentage to continue to grow. Wedbush analysts raised their price target to $725, based on the earnings beat, but reiterated an underperform rating on the stock saying, “We see underappreciated risks to search advertising as substantial enough to support our rating.” • Pacific Crest analysts had a cheerier view of Alphabet’s revenue opportunities, saying there are further growth opportunities with YouTube TV as well as with Google Cloud. Those two segments look to be beating non-search revenue at Google in terms of growth, they said. The analysts raised their price target to $1,100 from $1,040 and reiterated an outperform rating. • Susquehanna analysts see coming ad catalysts with device-specific bidding, advertising in Google’s local maps and the addition of a fourth advertisement at the top of its search page. Management’s tighter expense control as well as more share allocations should also improve sentiment around the stock. The analysts increased their price target to $1,200 from $1,000 and maintained a positive rating on the stock. • Alphabet’s tighter expense control, as evidenced by stable Google segment operating margins, should help soothe investor fears of greater investments later on, said UBS analysts. The analysts raised their price target to $1,050 from $950 and reiterated a buy rating. • RBC Capital Markets analysts said Alphabet’s earnings beat showed “more evidence of the sustainable fruit” of having an efficient management team and organizational structure. Alphabet highlighted mobile growth, with 44% year-over-year growth in paid clicks. “Alphabet just printed its 29th straight quarter of 20%ish organic revenue growth. We believe this is unprecedented, especially for an asset of this size,” said Mark Mahaney, lead analyst on the report. RBC analysts raised their price target to $1,050 from $1,025 and reiterated an outperform rating. • One other negative hanging over Alphabet has been controversy with advertisements appearing alongside controversial videos on YouTube. James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt, said he believes the issue has blown over and that management, including Chief Executive Sundar Pichai’s comments on the earnings call, have adequately addressed it. “We believe those concerns are alleviated at this point, with clear focus and interest evident that addressing content issues is a top priority,” Cakmak wrote. He raised his price target to $1,050 from $900 and reiterated a buy rating, saying he believes Alphabet is the “most favorable risk-reward tradeoff in large cap tech.” More from MarketWatch Two Foolproof Ways to Cook Eggs in Your Office Microwave 'Rich Dad' author Robert Kiyosaki on how to get rich in real estate 5 doomed stocks to sell in May Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets Investing Quote References GOOGL +33.08 +3.71% SPX -4.57 -0.19% Most Popular Elizabeth Warren says Obama got it wrong: It’s worse than Americans realize These Americans will never get Social Security benefits — and we don’t mean millennials PepsiCo focuses on ‘guilt-free’ beverages, yet more research casts a pall over diet soda The most unaffordable place to live in America is… Trump's Tax Plan: Three Key Takeaways Caitlin Huston Caitlin Huston is a MarketWatch reporter based in New York.

How to customize Chrome's terrible New Tab page Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:02am PDTApr 27, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares139 Applications News Article Contents 1 Removing suggested content 2 Removing recent downloads and offline pages 3 Removing recently-visited bookmarks 4 Show tabs from other devices 5 Turning on the condensed layout 6 Switching to the Chrome Home interface Back in Chrome 54, Google replaced Chrome for Android's New Tab page with a new design that prominently featured suggested content - much like Google Now's feed. To quote Douglas Adams, "This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move." Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. If you're not a fan of Chrome's cluttered New Tab page, there are a few workarounds you can try to make it a bit more usable. You can even mix and match features to create a more personalized design. The below workarounds require enabling or disabling Chrome flags. To do this, navigate to "chrome://flags" (without the quotes), press the menu icon, select 'Find in page,' and type the name of the flag starting with the hashtag symbol. Removing suggested content Removing the suggested articles list is pretty simple. Find the #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Once you do that and re-open Chrome, the list will no longer appear on the New Tab page. Removing recent downloads and offline pages The New Tab page also shows recent file downloads by default, but this is fairly easy to remove as well. Find the #enable-ntp-asset-download-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Then make sure you re-launch Chrome, and it should be gone. In addition, pages you have saved for offline reading show up on the New Tab page. If you want, you can turn this off by disabling #enable-ntp-offline-page-download-suggestions. Removing recently-visited bookmarks By default, Chrome shows bookmarks you have recently visited on the New Tab page. This can also be turned off by disabling the #enable-ntp-bookmark-suggestions flag. Show tabs from other devices As you may know, Chrome syncs your open tabs across your devices, so you can easily pick up from where you left off. There is a hidden flag that adds a 'Tabs from other devices' section to the New Tab Page. The only catch is that suggested articles has to also be turned on, which is a bit of a bummer. To turn it on, make sure both #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions and #enable-ntp-foreign-sessions-suggestions are set to Enabled. Then, reopen Chrome, and your tabs from other devices should appear. Turning on the condensed layout If you do like the suggested content or other features on the page, you still might want to turn on the condensed New Tab page layout. This removes the large space at the top, where the Google logo normally sits, allowing for more content to be visible without scrolling.   Left: Condensed design disabled, Right: Condensed design enabled To turn on the condensed layout, simply enable the #ntp-condensed-layout flag and re-launch Chrome. This is already enabled by default in Chrome Dev, at least on my device, so it may come to Chrome stable in the near future. Switching to the Chrome Home interface Chrome is constantly changing, and there's already another revamp of the New Tab page interface in development. It's called Chrome Home, and it moves the address bar to the bottom of the screen. With this new layout, the New Tab page is accessible by swiping up from the address bar, and it includes navigation icons for Downloads, Bookmarks, and History.    This new design only works on Chrome Dev and Canary for now. To try it out, switch #enable-chrome-home and #ntp-google-g-in-omnibox to Enabled and re-open Chrome. There you have it - a few tips to make Chrome's New Tab page less awful. Let us know in the comments if you have any suggestions we didn't mention. Tags chrome chrome 58 chrome home chrome new tab page chrome ntp new tab page ntp subscribe ...

George at this rate, They need an 'Of The Hour' section... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Switching what the Bixby button does was possible with an app, but the recent update removes this ability. Nerds go apoplectic with rage against Samsung. Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. No outrage yet. Corbin Davenport Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ An EXTRA button, i.e., a button other phones don't even have. Does Samsung have a good reason for locking it into Bixby? It's too early to tell. Shaun39 You should put a sarcasm tag at the end of your clueless comments. EcE An EXTRA button many people reportedly have been pressing accidentally more often than trying to use it. MadMartigan Bingo. They could at least have put it on the other side. As it is, 100% of the time I hit I am trying to turn the volume down. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You'll never admit it, but I guarantee you'd be complaining no matter where they put the button. MadMartigan I think you may be having some trouble reading for comprehension. I'll gladly admit it, as it has been my point all along. Not a fan of Bixby. Not a fan of the button placement. Wouldn't mind at least being able to remap it to make it at least marginally useful rather than just simply in the way. They put the button in a very bad place. Adding insult to injury - they have now disallowed making it at all useful to anyone not inexplicably fond of Bixby. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does. Also, if they put it on the right, I guarantee people would still complain about accidentally pressing it. In other words, you guys will complain about anything as long as it's Samsung. EcE The point you are missing, is the comment you are replying to: "Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change." Having that button which you could be able to disable if Samsung weren't dicks, is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people don't even have yet. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! The nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. EcE Because when someone found a way to change it's behavior, Samsung quickly blocked it. An extra hardware button is more annoying than a home page you can just ignore, period. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And you can use another browser. Nobody's forcing you to use Chrome. You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it. Or just buy a phone without an extra button. That'll show Samsung. Same difference. MadMartigan "You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it." Proof positive you just straight up refuse to understand that the placement is a problem for some people. "Just not pressing it" is not as simple as you seem to want to make it sound. I've accidentally launched it several times trying to lower the volume on the 8+ and I can only imagine it would be even worse on the S8. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Proof positive you're just a whiny baby. I've accidentally pressed the volume button many times when trying to press the power button, because my hand grabs both sides of the phone to get the leverage to press the power button. As much as it may amaze you to hear this, I survive this heart-rending inconvenience. MadMartigan God forbid anyone express an opinion that doesn't cast Samsung in the best possible light... /s MadMartigan ..and you nerd rage against anyone who thinks it might not be the best thing ever, can we talk about that, maybe? You know, since we're apparently not allowed to discuss the possibility that they might have handled it better? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You implied that the lack of complaints was because Chrome 58 is still rolling out. I pointed out that the nerd rage about the button occurred before people got their phones, thus nullifying your point. Discuss anything you want. MadMartigan Except any possibility that Samsung could have done something better. Apparently we're not allowed to do that without being called names... MadMartigan "If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does." So a bad key placement could not be made at least marginally better by allowing to map to something you might actually someday use... Got it. Your logic is flawless... /s Necdet Ali Özdür How come people don't press other buttons accidentally but​ somehow keep pressing Bixby button all the time? EcE Who said that? Necdet Ali Özdür ... you? EcE Oh yeah? I said: "Bixby is the only button people press accidentally" ... I'm sure I did. and btw, HTC's power button just below the volume buttons is/was (HTC 9/10 and whichever else they did the same) something to complain about as well. Either way, the point here is that having an extra button that cannot be disabled/remapped is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people have not seen yet. Necdet Ali Özdür That doesn't mean those people won't see it, I guess that's the point you are missing. Both decisions can be reversed by respective parties by means of a software update, but people (especially here in Android Police) complain about Samsung the most. EcE Nah, I think we enjoy bi+ching about everything Necdet Ali Özdür Who doesn't? 😂 MadMartigan Possibly due to it's bad placement. Have you been paying attention? Necdet Ali Özdür It's placed where a button could be placed on an all screen phone. Like the rest of them it's on the side. MadMartigan So there's no other place they could have put it? Really? I hope you're actually trying to be dense... Do phones you use not have tops, bottoms, or right sides? Do they have no room at all below where the button is currently placed on the left? Necdet Ali Özdür I hope that next phone you own will have a power button on the bottom and volume buttons on the top. Because those are valid positions to place buttons. Yeah. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It doesn't matter where the buttons are. If it's a Samsung phone, at least 75% of AP commenters will be outraged. MadMartigan ...and the one fanboy will attempt to shout down anyone with a valid opinion regarding how it could have been better. Because to him, Sammy can do no wrong. FWIW: I have not owned a Samsung since the S2 and as this was the first one without the ridiculous home button, I jumped at it. I like pretty much *everything* about the device other than the absurd Bixby-button. MadMartigan lmao. Are you being serious? HTC had power buttons on the top - never once accidentally powered it off. You really cannot accept that the placement may not be optimal for some people? That this is the only place they could have put it? Necdet Ali Özdür It's in a place where majority of current devices have their buttons. Sounds more optimal to me than the places you've suggested. Some people may not like to have it at that place, or not have that extra button at all. But in my opinion it is the best place to place Samsung could've put it. MadMartigan So the right side, where there is currently only one button, would be a worse place for it? They couldn't texture the power button and have the bixby button 1/2 inch below it? That wouldn't be better than the same texture as the volume keys, and right next to them? I mean heck, even if they'd just added a texture to it...that would have been better. Necdet Ali Özdür It is significantly smaller than the volume button (which is a rocker now) which makes it easy to differentiate with a finger. But yeah a texture wouldn't hurt. I agree you on this one. But if it was on the right side, I'm pretty sure people would still complain as much as they do now, claiming they're confusing it with the power button and such. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're complaining because it's a Samsung phone. If this was a button on the Pixel, it could be in the worst possible location and they'd go to the ends of the earth to defend it. MadMartigan Honestly, I would have loved it on the right, in a perfect location to be hit by the finger right above the pinky when needed. Power-index, Bixby two fingers down. Would have, IMO, been perfect. Could have even gone without the texture on that one. Where it is now, you're going after it with your thumb. Until muscle-memory kicks in, it's a crap-shoot where it's going to land initially and unless you expect to have to double-check, you're going in to press - and could easily press the wrong one. It's all personal preference, to be sure, but I do believe they could have appeased far more people by putting it on the right. FWIW - the same complain was leveled at HTC when they placed the power/volume buttons on the same side, though I do not believe the volume was a rocker on that model. Could have been done better. My favorite device was actually the One M7 - which had the power-button on the top. Power-top, volume-right, nothing on the left. Zero possibility of confusion. (Power on the back would have been fine as well - V20 nailed the fingerprint sensor/power on that one.) bekifft There is no good reason for locking hardware functionality away from the user. Don't give them a pass on taking more control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ As I say below, the nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. This isn't about timing. It's about Google love vs. Samsung hate. MadMartigan Wow. Someone's triggered... Tiuri Elvander I was and am still outraged. Have been since this came up in the review of 58 Beta Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, so far, that makes one of you, vs. the dozens of people who went into a nerd rage about the Bixby button, many of whom don't even have or want the phone. MJ I don't use Chrome a lot to care enough to disable the new tab page crap but why would Google stop users from customizing it? I can do that with Firefox... Address bar at the bottom of the screen? WTF? Michel Sa Address bar at the bottom makes a lot more sense on a mobile phone. Renan In a mobile phone, having the address bar at the bottom of the screen makes a lot of sense MJ No... ipsofact yes... MJ How have I been able to use the address bar on my phone at the top all this time? EcE Magic? ipsofact we never said you could not use the address bar on your phone. But on mobile its a lot quicker and pain free to have it at the bottom. Unless you want to stretch your thumb all the time. MJ Come on... Are you a human? When I hold my phone my thumb is already naturally pointing toward the top of my phone so would need to stretch it to make it to the bottom. Regardless, I happen to have nine other fingers and the on-screen keyboard pops up in the same place anyway. I have been using the address bar at the top of browsers for over 20 years now so don't need to be changing my workflow habits now and just on my phone on top of it. ipsofact typical ive been doing this for 20 years so I wont change the way I work. You know I work with several people with the same mentality.. I have been using the address bar at the top since day 1 but today I changed it to the bottom. Works great and believe me I won't let the old "ive been doing it like this for years" ever stop me. Or just put the phone upside down. it works ;) MJ Change is not the issue... It's change for no good reason or benefit. At least give the user control to change it back. Some unknown God(s) at Google one day just deciding the address bar will now go at the bottom is ridiculous. Microsoft tried that crap on a larger scale with Windows 8. How did that work out for them? ipsofact You can change it back and forth. Its up to the user to decide. So we are not being obligated to do anything. Just given options! :) Which I like. I can decide the whether the bar will go up the top or the bottom. MJ What? LOL The whole article is about Google not allowing users to disable the crap on new tabs. Thanks for your input and have a good day. MadMartigan "It's change for no good reason or benefit." Thankfully, your refusal to see the reason or benefit does not affect the ability of anyone else to. MadMartigan He said it made sense on the bottom - not that it wasn't unusable on the top. Reading is fundamental. FeelThePoveR It depends on the usage. Sometimes I press my hardware buttons accidentally when doing the swipe up gesture on the bottom adress bar in chrome (closing the tab/app or whatever). I'm still loving it though. MadMartigan People still use mobile Firefox?? ipsofact Firefox still use mobile people? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Except for Android and the Play Store (and their dependencies), I'm off all Google apps. I'm sick of the constant BS coming out of Google. I use Dolphin as my browser. If I get frustrated with Android enough, I'll just give up my precious S Pen and give an iPhone a chance. MadMartigan I loved that change and wish they'd bring it to desktop Chrome. Would love a "Google Now" start-page on the desktop. Kieron Quinn I've used iChrome as a Google Now-esque NTP for a while, it used to be a lot better (especially when it actually got Google Now cards via a hidden API) but is slowly getting worse: http://i.imgur.com/vfO7Kfq.png Lindajgomez My last paycheck was $22500 for working 12 hours a week online.Start earning $97/hour by working online from your home for few hours each day with GOOGLE...

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Crime Property Culture Royalty Crime 'Shameful' social media firms slammed for not tackling hate crime postings Google, Twitter and Facebook may face prosecution for failing to tackle online terrorism, violence and child abuse. By Rachel Middleton Updated May 1, 2017 06:08 BST Close Head of Google Europe Matt Brittin apologises for online adverts appearing near extremist material ITN The "biggest, richest and cleverest" companies in the world may face prosecution in the UK for leaving unlawful messages on their sites if MPs have their way. The Commons Home Affairs Select Committee has urged the next government to consider urgently a change in the law so that social media operators can be prosecuted for leaving unlawful messages on their sites. It is also asking that web companies be charged a fee for police investigations into illegal online posts, much as football teams are charged for match-day policing, the Times reports. Yvette Cooper, chair of the committee, said: "These are among the biggest, richest, and cleverest companies in the world and their services have become a crucial part of people's lives. "Social media companies' failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace. It is shameful. "They continue to operate as platforms for hatred and extremism without even taking basic steps to make sure they can quickly stop illegal material, properly enforce their own standards or keep people safe." The MPs held an inquiry into hate crime and its consequences after Jo Cox, a Labour MP, was killed by far-right terrorist Thomas Mair who searched online for material on Nazism and white supremacism. Amber Rudd, the home secretary has promised to study the committee's recommendations and said she expected the social media companies to take "early and effective action," BBC reports. Twitter: 'Vile and provocative images' The inquiry found that it was "shockingly easy" to access material on Google, Twitter and Facebook targeted at stirring up racial hatred. The MPs reported the postings to the internet companies but they remained accessible even after the complaints. While Twitter removed some tweets and suspended most of the offending accounts, many of the same "vile and provocative images could still be found on the platform six weeks later", said the committee. Facebook: The 'vehicle of choice for terrorist propaganda' The lawmakers highlighted how Twitter refused to take down a cartoon of a group of male, ethnic minority migrants tying up and abusing a semi-naked white woman while stabbing her baby on the grounds that "it was not in breach of [Twitter's] hateful content policy". "Given their immense size, resources and global reach, it is completely irresponsible of them to fail to abide by the law, and to keep their users and others safe," the report says. It noted that YouTube was the "vehicle of choice" for terrorist propaganda and attracting recruits while Twitter had been a "magnet for jihadist propaganda." The report said that hatred, abuse and extremism were growing at an alarming rate but remained unchecked and, even when illegal, largely unpoliced by the operators. Google 'profited from hatred' The MPs slammed Google for acting quickly to remove videos from YouTube when "they are found to infringe copyright rules but that the same prompt action is not taken when the material involves hateful or illegal content". "The most salient fact is that one of the world's largest companies has profited from hatred and allowed itself to be a platform from which extremists have generated revenue." Social media companies respond Twitter told the MPs that the company was becoming more proactive and was using technology better and collaborating with counter-terrorist and child protection experts. Simon Milner, the director of policy at Facebook, said: "Nothing is more important to us than people's safety on Facebook. That is why we have quick and easy ways for people to report content, so that we can review and if necessary remove it from our platform." YouTube had this to say: "We take this issue very seriously. We've recently tightened our advertising policies and enforcement, made algorithmic updates, and are expanding our partnerships with specialist organisations working in this field."

We use search engines every day, punching in terms, words and phrases and expecting answers about virtually everything. When we reverse the situation and we are the ones who want to get listed on the first page of Google, there is a big chasm to bridge and very few will profess to be expert search engine marketers. The first point to keep in mind is that if you have a comprehensive website, this is only the first step to drive sales. A website that has not been optimised for search engine ranking is like a shop that is located in an alley. No one really knows that the shop exists except its current clients. However, when launching websites, we are usually aiming to reach not only our present audience and customers but more importantly we are after new leads and business. A good chunk of these leads has to arise via search engines. A successful search engine optimisation programme is one which ultimately results in your website being listed on the first page of Google. The coveted top position in Google gets 33 per cent of the traffic and being listed beyond the first page can be meaningless for several industries. This is because few people go as far as clicking on the second page, so reaping the rewards of traffic from search engine intrinsically is tied with being on the first page. In fact, Google states that 80 per cent of search engine users stop their search on the first page. When people are making searches, they are taking a proactive stance and searching for something in which they are already interested. This means that in a way they are already within the sales funnel. It is up to a company to ensure that it is listed for a particular phrase or keyword as this gives the company a better chance to be included in the customer’s set of options. The type of keyword or key phrase that is actually used also indicates how deep in the sales funnel the person is or how close to the actual sales or booking. Search engines provide two main ways of exposing your business. The easier and faster option is Google AdWords where the business selects a series of keywords or phrases and then the search engine displays your website as part of the paid listings when users make a search. Such paid campaigns allow for micro-targeting and offer a variety of options such as even selecting the time of the day when you want the campaign to be active. However, as with all paid campaigns, this might not be the strategy to follow in the long run especially if the cost of the keywords turns out to decrease the profit margin substantially. The second, more laborious but long-lasting strategy is search engine optimisation. The essence of this strategy is a strong focus on the website itself. The first part of the exercise is identifying the keywords and key phrases which are of relevance to the business in question. In this activity, it is always imperative to investigate keywords from your customers’ perspective and identify which are the keywords that can direct traffic to your site. One facet is finding the keywords for which there is a lot of traffic and for which competition is rather low as these tend to offer more opportunities that are easier to tap in. The ranking that a website gets on Google ultimately hinges on the number of backlinks it has Once the keywords are clear, the focus should then be on the website content. The ranking of the website for a specific keyword is highly dependent on how relevant your website scores for that keyword. The content on the website needs to be structured in an appropriate way where the emphasis is placed on the most important phrases. Search engine experts also advocate that the website’s loading speed, duplicate content and experience on mobile devices affect the website’s ultimate ranking on search engines. Keeping a website’s content fresh also helps as Google is always on the lookout for websites that are distributing new content to their audience. One of the first points is establishing if your website is actually being listed on Google. If your website has been blacklisted, then you might need to explore strategies about how to start again from scratch. An important aspect of SEO is harnessing the power of local searches This means gearing your website and other online presences such as Google listings in such a way as to appear at the top of local search results in Google. The power of these listings cannot be over-emphasised. One cannot ignore that according to Google 76 per cent of local searches on mobile actually generate a visit to the real place within 24 hours and 28 per cent result in a sale. This brings search engines to a completely different playing field and all local business should work towards the objective of ranking highly in local SEO. For this type of ranking, there are other factors that come into play such as the consistency of the addresses used for the business in different online platforms and the number of reviews accumulated. Being present on a variety of directories associated with your location and your topic or product helps too. The ranking that a website gets on Google ultimately hinges on the number of backlinks it has. Originally considered as a mechanism that indicates a ‘thumbs-up’ or a kind of recommendation, the back-link constituted a mechanism where the number of back-links indicated your clout and the recognition of your business of ‘others’ not by yourself. It was a way of ensuring that only the best of the breed could climb the echelons to the top. Today this area of search engine still revolves around this concept and improving ranking via backlinks involves careful study on how to acquire high-quality, relevant, legitimate and authoritative links. Not everyone who links to your website has the same standing. The key to succeeding in this area is acquiring links naturally, evenly and as organically as possible. Content distribution is an intrinsic exercise and this entails making sure that the content that has been created is reaching far and wide. Search engine marketing cannot be done in isolation without looking at website analytics. The first question to ask is how much of your traffic is coming directly from search engines. Keeping an eye on the traffic helps you take informed decisions. Likewise you should also look at the keywords which are bringing in the current traffic. Investing in a good website is important as this is the equivalent of your salesperson and shop window. However, the website on its own is not enough. Search engine traffic is the motor that should be driving more clicks, bookings, sales or leads. Online marketing that does not rope in ongoing search engine marketing is simply letting your digital investment lying idle whilst your competitors reap the fruits.

By Sarmistha Acharya April 30, 2017 10:54 BST Google CEO received a $200m compensation package last year Getty Images/Ramin Talaie Google's chief executive officer Sundar Pichai received a $200m (£154m) compensation package for 2016, double of what he got a year before that. According to a regulatory filing on Friday (28 April), most of Pichai's compensation came from stock awards. He received 99.7% of his annual compensation in equity and 0.3% in salary. Google's parent company Alphabet gives large equity awards to its top executives including Pichai and the company's chief financial officer Ruth Porat, according the Wall Street Journal. Last year, Pichai received a salary of $650,000, compared to $652,500 in 2015. Alphabet co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were paid a symbolic $1. The compensation of Alphabet's executive chairman Eric Schmidt dropped by 46% to $4.3m, down from more than $8m in 2015 when he got a $6m bonus. Porat's pay increased 26% to $39m, up from $31m. Google has built the world's largest advertising business and is expanding into new forms of advertising like mobile search and automated ad buying. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's compensation totalled $27.4m last year. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mayer's salary was $1m. Like Pichai, most of her 2016 compensation comes from stock awards, valued at $11.3m and options awards valued at $13.3m.

Google Singapore on Thursday (April 27) said they will be working with Singapore-based running platform JustRunLah! to visually map these trails. Equipped with the Google Street View trekker - which is previously used to map overseas locations such as the Grand Canyon - members of the running group will record 30 running and walking trails across the island.

The device weighs 20kg and is mounted to a frame with straps to allow the runner to carry it easily. JustRunLah! hopes that mapping the trails on Street View will allow runners to visualise and better plan their trail routes. Google also announced that its Special Collections programme, which is found within the Street View mobile app or on a Web browser, has been updated with 30 indoor and outdoor attractions in Singapore. These include Coney Island Park and the National Gallery Singapore. The segment highlights interesting sites around the world. "Singapore is a top Asian destination for tourists worldwide and having the newly added Special Collections will give tourists a first glance at their trip planning," said Cynthia Wei, 34, Street View programme manager.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Google Assistant SDK launches for developers and device makers Khari Johnson@kharijohnson April 27, 2017 10:00 AM Above: Google Assistant logo Image Credit: Alphabet Google today opened the software development kit (SDK) of its Google Assistant, allowing tinkerers and companies making devices to incorporate Google Assistant into products like smart speakers, cars, or robots. An SDK means people can shop, ask questions, check their calendar, and other services with Google Assistant without using a Google device. Device makers will also be able to see a transcription of communications with the device and use that text to change how their device operates. “You can use this text to implement additional local device functionality based on the conversation. For example, you could scan for certain happy or sad keywords and change the mood lighting of the device,” said Google developer advocate Wayne Piekarski in a video intro for the SDK. The opening of the SDK in developer preview continues what has been a steady march to spread Google Assistant to more devices. Since the debut of the intelligent assistant last year, Google Assistant has been available on Pixel smartphones, Google Home, Google Allo, Android Wear, and phones running the Marshmallow or Nougat operating systems (roughly one-third of all Android uses thus far), and soon Android Auto and Android TV. “The Google Assistant SDK includes a gRPC API, a Python open source client that handles authentication and access to the API, samples and documentation,” said Google product manager Chris Ramsdale in a blog post. The SDK allows you to capture a spoken query, for example ‘what’s on my calendar’, pass that up to the Google Assistant service and receive an audio response. And while it’s ideal for prototyping on Raspberry Pi devices, it also adds support for many other platforms.” The SDK is part of the approach taken to spread their intelligent assistants by companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung beyond their own devices. The Amazon Echo SDK, for example, has been used to extend Alexa to a motorized wheelchair and home robot. A can of Pringles and a Raspberry Pi can be combined to make a crude, delicious-smelling version of the Amazon Echo. An integration with General Electric appliances is also coming. Google first announced plans to release a Google Assistant software development kit at an event to debut the Pixel smartphones and other devices last October. In another big change for the assistant, last week Google Assistant on Google Home gained the ability to recognize unique voice and support up to six accounts.

Google’s 44-year-old India-born CEO Sundar Pichai received nearly $200 million in compensation last year, double the amount he got in 2015. Pichai received a salary of $650,000 last year, slightly less than the $652,500 he earned in 2015. But the long-time Google employee, who was named CEO during the company’s re-organisation in August 2015, received a stock award of $198.7 million in 2016, roughly double his 2015 stock award of $99.8 million. The company’s compensation committee attributed the lavish pay to Pichai’s promotion to CEO and “numerous successful product launches”, the CNN reported. Larry Page, Google’s co-founder and previous CEO, shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella. Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing, the report said. In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice controlled smart speaker. These efforts have started to pay off for the company. Google’s “other revenues”, a category that includes hardware and cloud services, hit nearly $3.1 billion in the most recent quarter, a gain of about 50 per cent from the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet’s stock has soared this year, pushing it above a $600 billion market cap this week for the first time, the report said.

Image: Asif Islam/Shutterstock Alphabet’s latest quarterly earnings show that despite its subsidiary Google going through a rough patch in digital advertising, it is still a force to be reckoned with on Wall Street. Although it is the parent company to a number of Google enterprises, the actual Google business for Alphabet remains its largest and greatest revenue generator. In its first quarterly report for 2017, the corporation has shown once again that it is a formidable player in advertising, with revenues up more than $4bn on last year, from $20.3bn to $24.8bn. This marks a 22pc increase in revenues year-on-year, up from 17pc the year before. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s net profit amounted to $5.42bn, showing a huge 29pc gain on the same time last year. What is interesting is that much of this success remains within Google’s online advertising revenues, from both search ads and YouTube. The latter has proven controversial of late, with The Wall Street Journal recently publishing an article on brands that were unknowingly advertising on videos inciting hate speech and other inappropriate concepts. As a result, these companies began a mass boycott of YouTube, much to the worry and chagrin of its army of creators. Given that much of this occurred during the findings of this latest Q1 report, it proves that even Google can weather a storm of such scale and come out the other side with only a few scratches. Other bets not as profitable The resulting figures have also encouraged the stock market to react strongly, with Alphabet’s shares rising by nearly 3pc to $916.80 at the end of the trading day. Aside from beating market estimates, analysts have described Alphabet’s stated figures as exceptional for a company that exists on such a scale. Speaking to Reuters, analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners said: “For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has, is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make. They are the dominant force in digital advertising.” However, Alphabet’s self-titled ‘Other Bets’, which includes all of its research and connectivity divisions such as Waymo and Google Fiber, have not fared as well as Google. Despite announcing revenues of $244m – a near 50pc increase on 2016 – it still posted significant losses of $855m. “We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet,” said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet.

Video Samsung DeX: The Galaxy S8 desktop dock really works Another week nears its end, and that means there’s been another week of big Play Store releases that you might have missed. Seeking some exciting new apps and games to toss onto your Android phone? Look no further. Star Wars: Puzzle Droids pairs the likes of BB-8 and R2-D2 with Candy Crush matching, while Google Classroom can now be used by anyone to assist learning experiences of all sorts. Adult Swim’s very weird Robot Unicorn Attack 3 is also out this week, along with a well-timed Gorillaz experience app for the virtual band’s new album, while Invert is an intriguing indie puzzler. Clear a little space and hit the Play Store for some fresh downloads. Star Wars: Puzzle Droids  Greenbot Puzzle Droids isn't ambitious, but it is nicely presented. May 4 is Star Wars Day (“May the fourth…”), and fans are still buzzing from the first The Last Jedi trailer at the recent Star Wars Celebration. If you too love Star Wars, then here’s something else you might want to try: Star Wars: Puzzle Droids. There’s really no beating around the bush here: it’s a Star Wars version of Candy Crush Saga.  Puzzle Droids mines the same kind of match-three formula as you create sets of like-colored items on the board, create and utilize power-ups from larger matches, and attempt to satisfy each level’s demands before you run out of turns. It’s not a very inspiring creation, admittedly. However, if you like this kind of straightforward puzzle gameplay, but have exhausted the Candy Crush series or don’t love its aesthetic, then Puzzle Droids might satisfy. It currently has 50+ stages featuring characters and settings from Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but more will likely come. Google Classroom Greenbot Create your own virtual classroom to keep everyone connected. Google Classroom has been available on Android for a couple years now, letting teachers and students stay connected and organized online. However, until recently, it was only usable by those with a G Suite for Education account. Last month, Google opened the service up to all of its users, and now this week, anyone can also use the app to create their own classrooms.  What’s the point? Well, Classroom may have been designed for connecting to traditional learning environments, but it remains a smartly organized tool for collaboration and learning of all sorts. So if you’re running a club or want to share knowledge as a mentor, you could use the app to keep everyone connected and on the same page with announcements, assignments, notes, and more. It can be a pretty handy tool for educators and learners of all stripes. Robot Unicorn Attack 3 Greenbot Adult Swim has the market cornered on absurdist unicorn games. One of mobile gaming’s most confounding and delightful experiences is back in action with Adult Swim’s new Robot Unicorn Attack 3. In case you missed the previous entries, the game really is as strange as it sounds: you’ll command a mechanized unicorn as you gallop and leap across floating fantasy platforms and smash through giant star gems and enemies, all in the hopes of setting a new high score. Oh, and the song “Always” by Erasure plays on an endless loop. Robot Unicorn Attack 3 keeps the basics from the last entry, albeit with more of a zoomed-in, 3D look, but there’s a lot more freemium stuff between runs. Now you can build up a citadel for your robotic steeds, build stables, and sacrifice collected unicorns to upgrade your favorites. It’s all still funny at first blush, but we’ll have to see whether this familiar gag remains entertaining over the long haul again in RUA3. Gorillaz Greenbot Move your phone to look around freely—or switch to VR mode. Cartoon band Gorillaz—created by Blur frontman Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett—are back with a brand new album out today (Humanz) and an impending tour, and they’ve also released an odd little Android app. Exploring the personalities of the four virtual band members, the app lets you look around their living spaces and interact with various objects. Unfortunately, a lot of what you’ll find are just links to external content: Spotify playlists generated for each member, video interviews, or the Gorillaz’ online shop. In some cases, you can watch external content and then answer questions to unlock further things in the app, but the constant back and forth is annoying. Still, the atmosphere is intriguing, plus it has some augmented reality elements and a VR mode for anyone who has a Cardboard viewer around.  Invert Greenbot Tap along the edges to flip entire rows, columns, or sets of tiles. If Star Wars meets Candy Crush won’t satisfy your puzzle urge this week, maybe Invert ($3) can do the trick instead. This calmer indie puzzler is built around flipping tiles to solve puzzles, with each level giving you a grid of shapes split between two colors. Tapping one of the little markers on the outside of the grid can flip an entire row or column of tiles to the other color, and you’ll have limited moves to turn the whole thing into the same color. Before long, you’ll also encounter buttons that flip certain groups or patterns of tiles, which really changes up your thinking, and then the square tiles give way to triangles and hexagons in later stages. It’s a serious brainteaser, but Invert won’t prod you too hard thanks to its play-at-your-own-pace design, along with a minimal aesthetic and some tranquil background tunes.

I couldn't disagree more vehemently. Yesterday's antitrust laws can't regulate today's technology, but they sure as heck can certainly destroy its profit potential. And, unfortunately, yours, too. Here's what you need to know… and how to defend your money against government meddling. The Government Wants a Piece of Google Pie Jonathan Taplin is no slouch. In fact, he's a very bright guy who is the Director Emeritus of the University of Southern California's Annenberg Innovation Lab. Normally, I agree with him – especially when it comes to Silicon Valley, which he characterizes as being populated by a bunch of spoiled, ignorant brats who are clueless when it comes to the consequences of their actions… to which I'll add, "and their products." There is nothing more frustrating to me than knowing Google – aka Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL) – dominates today's digital world. Speaking personally, I hate the fact that every digital footprint I leave is tagged somewhere by some company unknown to me that's anxious to sell it to the highest bidder in an effort to "monetize" my behavior. And, while we're at it, I loathe the fact that the technology is increasingly being sold to medical providers, insurance companies, financial providers – all of which are using it to deliver "targeted" advertising and services to me at prices that somehow always seem higher than they used to be. The very term is an insult. But having the government break Google up?! No way. The markets will take care of that all by themselves, and investors who are along for the ride will do very well by letting that happen instead of falling prey to out of touch regulators who don't understand what's going on. Take Google's browser, Chrome, for example. It's got an 88% market share of browser traffic because competing browsers like Microsoft's Internet Explorer stinks and Yahoo's ill-fated Axis stunk. Users selected Google because they liked it and found it valuable. The argument that antitrust regulation works on behalf of the consumer is a four letter word that I can't print. When you take a closer look, most of the people complaining about big monopolies are not consumers, but other suppliers who stand to benefit if there's enforcement action. Naturally, regulators will try to sell the breakup as a great story. Instead of trying to help existing and new companies develop, the government wants to compete by punishing the successful. They always have – with railroads, with oil, with airlines – and now they're going to do it with technology (and, if this idea gathers steam, with Alphabet Inc., specifically). People don't realize it, but the Justice Department, working in concert with a wide variety of Washington agencies, has canned a number of deals over the past few years, including Sysco Corp.'s (NYSE: SYY) attempt to buy U.S. Foods, Comcast Corp.'s (Nasdaq: CMCSA) attempt to purchase Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWX), Staples Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS), and Office Depot Inc. (Nasdaq: ODP), just to name a few. Things are so egregious that even Thai Union (OTCMKTS: TUFBY), which makes Chicken of the Sea, was stopped from buying Bumble Bee Tuna back in 2015, for crying out loud. Tuna fish!  What Policy Wonks Are Missing The last thing a regulator should want to do is hobble one of the world's most successful companies. Doing so will squash innovation and destroy hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value – much of which is in retirement plans. The numbers are hard to come by, but this is especially important when you consider that individual households may own as much as 80% of the corporate equity market when you combine the estimated 38% of stocks owned directly by U.S. households with the indirect ownership associated with mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance policy investments. I can all but guarantee that regulators haven't thought about how much wealth they'll destroy if they move ahead. And, of course, that's also part of the problem. Companies like Alphabet are completely changing the face of what we think about regulation, utilities, government, structure – you name it – specifically because they're unconventional, innovative, and empowering. Like the other companies in the so-called "Fabulous Five" we talk about frequently, Alphabet has become so integral to our lives that it's a "must-have." I'm not surprised in the least that the company rubs Washington's inner circle the wrong way because it bypasses what they consider to be the proper relationship between those who rule and those who follow. Big Companies Are Not Anti-Competitive – Antitrust Laws Are Antitrust laws have their roots in the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Federal Trade Commission Act and Clayton Act of 1914, all of which are intended to ensure lower prices, efficient competition, and higher quality in the name of consumer protection. Here's the rub… Unlike most laws, which have a very clear-cut basis for what's right or wrong, antitrust laws are based on an unreasonable restraint of trade. That means they're decided on a case-by-case basis. Obviously certain things like price fixing and bid rigging are so blatant that they're considered "per se" violations, a legal term meaning there is no justification nor allowable defense under the law.  But – and you'll see where I'm going with this in a minute – violations are determined one by one. The Justice Department, acting on input from global regulators worried about competition and product development in more than 30 markets, has iced deals left and right to in the name of "consumer protection." This makes plenty of sense to government watchdogs who would rather use government policy as a punitive measure than a tool for national ambition and success. Yet, it makes no sense whatsoever to anybody interested in actual competition, let alone profits. Never mind that this country and capitalism are based on opportunity, not coercion. Government apparatchiks cannot understand the very fundamentals of capitalism let alone how money actually works. Every individual and company has the right to enter any market they choose and to sell goods and services at a price that the market will bear. Nobody is forced to sell and nobody is forced to buy. Ever. The hypocrisy is staggering. Microsoft isn't going to roll over and let Apple take over huge sections of its business simply because it's too dominant with a 90% market share. The DOJ's said nothing. Amazon isn't going to pause to let Alibaba gain ground because it's feeling guilty about the fact that the company accounted for more than 50% of e-commerce volume growth last year. The DOJ's taken no action. Facebook isn't going to slow down now that it accounts for 43.9% of all social media site visits, let alone give that back to MySpace because it's been too successful. The DOJ's been silent. Or consider Becton, Dickinson and Co. (NYSE: BDX) when it bought CareFusion Corp. in 2015. In fact, we specifically noted the merger as a catalyst for higher profits when I brought it to subscribers' attention in our sister publication, the Money Map Report, and gave anybody who followed along the opportunity to capture triple-digit returns of at least 163% since. Nobody raised a stink when Vincent Forlenza, Becton Dickinson's chairman, noted specifically that the deal was a major milestone in the company's 118-year history and "significantly accelerates BD's strategy" … "as we become one of the largest global leaders in medical technology." At the end of the day, the only true monopoly is the government because it's the only entity capable of using force to intervene in otherwise free markets. Businesses cannot force consumers to do anything in truly free markets. Should You Still Invest in Alphabet? Now, let me get off my soapbox and talk about how you make money in a situation like this. That is, after all, why we're all here. Without hesitation – you should be buying shares of Alphabet Inc. even if you have to do it one share at a time and even if it's flirting with all-time highs. Alphabet is the ultimate digital equivalent of completely free choice – and customers love it because it's innovative, efficient, and profitable. But you have to buy it ahead of time – meaning before the government push to break it up gathers momentum. (Or risk getting left far behind.) At the end of the day, it's not Alphabet that the regulators find so threatening but the innovation driving it. That's why the company is far more valuable than they'll ever understand. Investors simply cannot afford to miss the boat. The company is also one of the top five holdings in what I like to call the "Blue Chip Hall of Famer" program. It's just one of several my team dug up, and belongs to a special class of investments you can get in on today. I call them "26(f) programs." They give investors the opportunity to earn aggressive monthly income combined with huge lump-sum payouts. You can potentially get paid $2,000… $5,000… even more… every month for the rest of your life And on top of that, there are 26(f) programs that can operate as 100% legal tax havens.

Close April 28, 2017 Uber's race to develop fleets of self-driving cars and big rigs has hit another speed bump: yesterday, the head of its autonomous vehicle program stepped down from his post in the wake of a complicated lawsuit.  The move isn't especially surprising.  A recap For nearly nine years, Anthony Levandowksi was a software engineer at Google, where he played a key role in the company's self-driving car program (now known as Waymo). He left his post in January 2016 and launched Otto, a company devoted to developing autonomous 18-wheelers. A few months later, in August 2016, Otto was acquired by Uber, and Levandowski was tapped to lead Uber's self-driving car program. Such fast-paced transitions aren't unusual among tech companies, which are always trying to poach top engineering talent. What is unusual is that Levandowski may have left his gig at Google with masses of the company's top-secret documents. Google and its subsidiary, Waymo, filed suit against Uber and Otto in February, alleging that Levandowski stole 14,000 design files and 9.8 gigabytes of trade secrets before leaving his post. They also allege that Uber has been using some of those designs--specifically, those involving LiDAR*--in Uber's own self-driving vehicles. Interestingly, Uber hasn't commented on whether Levandowski stole Google's proprietary technology. However, the company has said that Google's lawsuit is without merit because Uber isn't using any of the company's tech designs and therefore isn't profiting from it. However, at least Uber employee--one who's worked with Levandowski since his Google days--says that Uber's claims aren't exactly true. In a deposition, he said that Uber has, in fact, been prototyping a secret, unnamed LiDAR system that's closely related to those Google designed. Complicating matters is the fact that Levandowski himself has refused to testify in the case, citing his Fifth Amendment rights, which protect him from self-incrimination.  In other words: Google/Waymo says Levandowski is helping Uber/Otto to cheat on self-driving tech; Uber/Otto says "nuh-uh"; a worker at Uber says that Google/Waymo has a valid point; and the man at the center of the debate, Levandowski, has chosen to stay out of it entirely. What's new Levandowski is still employed by Uber, and he continues to work on the company's self-driving tech program, which is housed within Uber's Advanced Technologies Group. (According to his LinkedIn profile, Levandowski remains Uber's vice president of engineering.) However, he's notified his team members that he's stepping down from his position as head of ATG, and though he'll continue to head into the office, he won't be working on anything related to LiDAR until the lawsuit wraps up. He sent an email to everyone "not to include me in meetings or email threads related to LiDAR, or ask me for advice on the topic". Co-worker Eric Meyhofer has been named the interim head of ATG, and Levandowski will report directly to him rather than to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. In the short term, the shuffling of duties isn't likely to have much effect on Uber's self-driving vehicle program (which in fairness, still needs a lot of work). In his email, Levandowski notes that he didn't previously work on LiDAR technology at Uber, and the only difference in the future appears to be that he's actively avoiding input on such tech. That probably won't do anything to diminish the contentiousness of the Google/Waymo/Uber/Otto lawsuit. Nor will slow the rollout of Uber's autonomous tech. Whether that tech will be safe (and whether it can be applied to aircraft) are entirely different matters. *LiDAR (i.e. Light Detection and Ranging) technology has been embraced by many developers of self-driving technology, with the notable exception of Tesla. It's similar to radar, the major difference being that instead of radio waves as radar does, LiDAR uses light waves.  Tags: Autonomous cars Google Google Autonomous Car lawsuit self-driving cars Uber Waymo News 2017 The Car Connection See the winners » 2017 The Car Connection See The Winner and Nominees » Recommended Galleries 2016-2017 Toyota Tacoma pickup recalled: 228,000 U.S. vehicles affected Chinese start-up Lynk & Co. to offer lifetime warranties on new cars Uber to launch flying autonomous taxis in Dallas and Dubai within 10 years (or less) 2017 Nissan Rogue Sport costs $22,360 to start, Darwin may be proud People who read this also read Toyota Tacoma recall, Raptor vs. Hellcat, 2018 Chevy Volt... 2018 VW Atlas won't be easy to find as a 4-cylinder 2016-2017 Toyota Tacoma pickup recalled: 228,000 U.S...

You get an easy and honest conversation that speaks volumes about how we can talk to our kids about gender and how much we can learn from their openness. Hennessy, a 32-year-old transgender male, recently participated in a workshop held by SheKnows Media, a leading women’s lifestyle company. “What gender do you think I am?” Hennessy asked 11 sixth-graders in New York City who are members of SheKnows’ unique Hatch program, which focuses on teaching digital literacy and citizenship to the next generation. The program is in its fourth year. There is silence for a second, and then one girl says “male” and another says, “I heard earlier that you were transgender.” Hennessy, an actor in New York City and co-host of the podcast “Kill Me Now” with comedian Judy Gold, says they are both right. “I’m a transgender male,” he says. And then the questions begin. “When did you first realize you were transgender?” a boy asks before the conversation turns to terms the kids may or may not have heard before: transgender, agender (when you don’t identify as male or female), gender fluid (you feel more masculine one day, more feminine the next) and sexual orientation. ‘Don’t treat it like a gross, icky … thing’ Hennessy hopes the new video of the Hatch workshop, released Thursday, will be seen by children and parents across the country and lead to more understanding about people like himself who are born with reproductive organs that do not match their gender identity. “If you don’t treat it like a gross, icky, weird, evil thing, they don’t treat it like a gross, icky, weird, evil thing,” Hennessy said in an interview. When kids as young as 4 or 5 years old use female pronouns when they meet him, he tells them, “Oh, no, I’m a boy,” at which point they often ask, “What, you’re a boy?” He then explains to them what being transgender is. “And boom, they get it right away,” he said. Maverick, 12, knew what transgender was before taking part in the Hatch workshop. His mom is a sexuality educator who has been talking to him about sexuality and gender since birth. But he had never met anyone who was transgender until Hennessy. “I thought it was a very powerful experience for me,” Maverick said. “I’m not sure about other kids, but I think meeting a transgender male for the first time was a very impactful thing in my life.” The experience gives him a better understanding of how other people think, he said. “I think it just tells me more about others and how to act with them and respect them in different ways.” Reed, who’s also 12 and participated in the workshop, said it’s very helpful to meet and talk with someone who is transgender or watch them in a video. “It’s not just like learning from maybe people who don’t know that much about that,” she said. “You’re learning from people who have experienced it.” ‘Just Google it’ Logan Levkoff is a sexuality educator who has taught and designed many of the sex education programs used in private schools throughout New York City and the surrounding areas. She is also the mother of Maverick and an 8-year-old daughter. Gender is a constant conversation in their household. “We’ve always spent a lot of time talking about what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl and maybe more importantly, the fact that there is not one definition of boy and girl and anything in between,” said Levkoff, author of “Got Teens? The Doctor Moms’ Guide to Sexuality, Social Media and Other Adolescent Realities.” She has told her kids that every person has the right to experience life the way they see fit, in a way that best reflects who they are. “And sometimes that means not feeling like a boy or not feeling like a girl or feeling like something else entirely,” she said. Her advice for parents, when it comes to how and when to start talking to kids about what it means to be transgender and gender in general, is to first figure out what exactly they want their kids to know and then recognize what their own limitations are and the gaps in their own knowledge. “The likelihood is that for a lot of parents, they may not have any personal experience, which means that you have to get some information and education and also be willing to tell your child, if they have a question for you, to say, ‘You know what, I don’t know what the answer is, but I’m going to find it out for you,’ ” said Levkoff. Hennessy, who grew up in Maui, Hawaii, at a time when there was no dialogue about being transgender, said parents should absolutely take time to learn more about it. “Just Google it. Google transgender. Google transsexual. Google tranny, and it won’t take that long,” he said. “Just learn a little bit. All you’ve got to do is start. You don’t have to learn everything all at once … It’s a lot simpler than people try to make it, so we have all these definitions and words to define things, but it’s really super simple. … We overthink it.” Hennessy didn’t hear the term transgender until roughly five years ago. Before that, he always felt “off,” he said. “I felt totally born wrong since day one.” Ashamed about being in a woman’s body, he had bound his breasts ever since he started developing. “I would wear two sports bras and one of my dad’s extra-large shirts … and any time the wind blew up against me, I would pull my shirt up off of my chest.” How parents can learn from their kids Like Levkoff, Hennessy can’t emphasize enough how the more honest and open you are with your child about sexuality and gender, the better. “I say, as soon as they start asking you, answer the questions, no matter how old they are, as soon as they start asking you, because if you don’t answer them, someone else will, and you can choose what they hear first,” he said. “It takes the mysticism out of sex. It takes the pervertedness out of sex.” Levkoff, who also is author of “Third Base Ain’t What It Used to Be: What Your Kids are Learning About Sex Today and How to Teach Them to Become Sexually Healthy Adults,” believes there really is no such thing as what conversation is “age appropriate.” It all depends on the individual. “There are some young kids who are really capable of some really sophisticated thought about gender and sexuality, and there are some adults who are completely incapable of having a mature conversation, so age doesn’t determine whether or not someone can handle this, but I think it’s important for parents to remember that from the time our kids are born, how we dress them, how we allow them to express themselves, how we allow other people to talk to them or the assumptions they make about them, are all little doses of education about gender and expression,” she said. What is clear, at least from the video featuring Hennessy and the Hatch participants, is that there’s a lot parents can learn from kids, especially about topics such as gender. “I think parents should learn from kids, because kids are more exposed to all this stuff now … and parents, their generation wasn’t as exposed,” said Reed, one of the young participants. “It shouldn’t just be kids learning from parents. It should go all ways.” Levkoff said she is “constantly amazed” at how “color- and gender-blind” today’s kids are. “And by the way, not all of them, because they are a product of us,” she said. “But their default setting isn’t to be intolerant. Their default setting is to just be open, and that’s really an incredible thing to watch.” Hennessy said most parents teach their kids to love equally and to eschew racism. He hopes they will also find ways to teach them to be open and accepting of another person’s gender. “When someone is coming to you with something that is different from your experience, just give them a chance to tell their side and believe them and don’t try to change them, because by trying to change them, you’re telling them that their existence isn’t good enough,” Hennessy said.

In summary, if you want access to the internet to look like this, you should be against net neutrality, like the administration’s new chair at the FCC (via): If you don’t, then you should be for net neutrality. In this post, I’ll explain what net neutrality is, review how net neutrality was protected under the Obama administration, how and why the Trump administration seeks to remove that protection, take a quick look at the current state of play, and conclude with how contact the FCC to share your views. What Is Net Neutrality? The term “net neutrality” was coined by Tim Wu (interviewed at NC here when he was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York). In fact, Wu wrote the FAQ (which you should read in its entirety): Network neutrality is best defined as a network design principle. The idea is that a maximally useful public information network aspires to treat all content, sites, and platforms equally. This allows the network to carry every form of information and support every kind of application. That’s more than a little wonky, so let’s give an English translation. From the Google: The principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites. And if you think about how you “surf the web,” treating “all content, sites, and platforms equally” (“access to all content and applications regardless of the source “) pretty much describes how your Internet works; you can click seamlessly from a small blog like Naked Capitalism to an enormous website like Google’s search page to YouTube or Vimeo for video to satellite imagery from NASA to a Bear Cam in Katmai National Park, Alaska. Who could be against that? Well, I’m not going to describe the entire corporate landscape of Internet Service Providers (ISP) and all their incentives (telcos large and small, cable companies, satellite dish companies, etc). But here’s a high-level metaphor: The Internet was famously described by then-Alaska Senator Ted Stevens as “a series of tubes” (the “Intertubes”). What if you not only owned one of those tubes, but you owned some of the data — but not all! — of the data flowing, like water, through your tubes? (Much like Time-Warner owns a tube, and also rents movies — data — on demand.) Wouldn’t you want to maximize the profit from your control of your tube — and cripple your competitors — by giving your data priority? Of course you would. Hence the reductio ad absurdum of the image above. And hence the necessity for regulation to ensure, as Tim Wu puts it, “a maximally useful public information network” (emphasis mine). How the Obama Administration Protected Net Neutrality Although the Obama administration initially set the table for net neutrality’s abolition — its choice for FCC Commissioner, Tom Wheeler, was a tube cable lobbyist — a successful grassroots campaign — which, besides online activists, also included corporate heavweights that benefit from net neutrality, like Google — ultimately led in 2015 to net neutrality’s adoption, as the FCC decided to regulate ISPs under Title II of the Communications Act as common carriers. (This is like treating ISPs as public utilities, and the issue is often framed that way, but the two are not identical in function or law). Tim Wu explains “common carrier”: The concept of a “common carrier,” dating from 16th century English common law, captures many similar concepts [to open access and anti-discrimination remedies for “threats to the end-to-end nature of the Internet”]. A common carrier, in its original meaning, is a private entity that performs a public function (the law was first developed around port authorities). Taxis, for example, are common carriers. After stopping for you in the tube street, your taxi driver can’t discriminate by handing you a different rate sheet if they don’t like the look of you, or refuse to take you to your destination. (And when they do, they’re failing in their duty.) Ars Technica explains how the common carrier concept operates for ISPs under the FCC’s ruling: FCC officials also provided further background in a phone call with reporters today. One thing they were clear on: this isn’t “utility-style regulation,” because there will be no rate regulation, Internet service providers (ISPs) won’t have to file tariffs, and there’s no unbundling requirement that would force ISPs to lease network access to competitors. But the order does reclassify ISPs as common carriers, regulating them under Title II of the Communications Act, the same statute that governs telephone companies. Internet providers will be common carriers in their relationships with home Internet and mobile broadband customers; they will also be common carriers in their relationships with companies that deliver content to subscribers over the networks operated by ISPs. That includes online content providers such as Amazon or Netflix. The ban on blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization is the biggest takeaway. “Broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices… may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices… [and] may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration—in other words, no ‘fast lanes.’ This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates,” the FCC said. The core provisions of Title II banning “unjust and unreasonable practices” will be used to enforce these rules. In other words, the tube owners won’t be able to maxmize profit from their control of their tubes by treating data owned by others differently data they own themselves, exactly like taxi drivers can’t discriminate against riders, because taxis are common carriers. The New York Times gives the political background for the FCC decision. From 2015: The new rules, approved 3 to 2 along party lines, are intended to ensure that no content is blocked and that the Internet is not divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for Internet and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else. Those prohibitions are hallmarks of the net neutrality concept. Before the vote, each of the five commissioners spoke and the Republicans delivered a scathing critique of the order as overly broad, vague and unnecessary. Ajit Pai, a Republican commissioner, said the rules were government meddling in a vibrant, competitive market and were likely to deter investment, undermine innovation and ultimately harm consumers. Opponents of the new rules, led by cable television and telecommunications companies, say adopting the Title II approach opens the door to bureaucratic interference with business decisions that, if let stand, would reduce incentives to invest and thus raise prices and hurt consumers. Supporters of the Title II model include many major Internet companies, start-ups and public interest groups. In a statement, Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, which includes Google, Facebook and smaller online companies, called the F.C.C. vote “a welcome step in our effort to create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules.” The F.C.C.’s yearlong path to issuing rules to ensure an open Internet precipitated an extraordinary level of political involvement, from grass-roots populism to the White House, for a regulatory ruling. The F.C.C. received four million comments, about a quarter of them generated through a campaign organized by groups including Fight for the Future, an advocacy nonprofit. Ajit Pai is, of course, the new FCC commissioner under the incoming Trump Administration, which immediately moved to re-open the debate and roll back the ISPs Title II designation, as the 3-2 party line votes suggests they would. Since none of power players or financial incentives have changed, we can expect quite a battle.[1] And exactly as in 2015, we should not assume the battle is lost. It isn’t. How the Trump Administration Seeks to Eliminate Net Neutrality Here’s the PDF of Pai’s full speech, where he begins his assault.[2] Gizmodo has a fine summary here, of which I’ll pull out just one point, since I’ve been focusing on those tubes and, as the first image shows, what the “Intertubes” would look like if those tube owners weren’t forced to act as common carriers: In his speech, Pai said “Nothing about the Internet was broken in 2015. Nothing about the law had changed. And there wasn’t a rash of Internet service providers blocking customers from accessing the content, applications, or services of their choice.” This is incredibly disingenuous. Note how Pai said ISPs weren’t blocking traffic to certain sites, because sure, that wasn’t happening. But blocking wasn’t the only kind of harm prevented by the net neutrality order: it also had bright-line rules against paid prioritization and throttling, where ISPs would limit or boost traffic to certain websites. One of the most high-profile examples of abuse was Comcast throttling traffic to Netflix in order to extract a payment deal from the streaming video provider, which it eventually agreed to pay. And in 2012, AT&T blocked FaceTime on iPhones, claiming it was using too much bandwidth. In this case, critics argued it was an attempt to block a service that competed with its own voice services. And as the biggest ISPs keep gobbling up content-producers, like AT&T buying DirectTV and then providing free access to its content, the risks that ISPs will start prioritizing traffic only increase. (There are plenty of other specious arguments in Pai’s screed, like the idea that net neutrality — as opposed to monopolization — is preventing ISPs from investing in infrastructure. I’m sure we’ll get to all of them over time.) Tim Wu explains what’s really going on — ka-ching — on the opinion page of the New York Times. Speaking to motive: President Trump’s chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate net neutrality (technically, make it “voluntary”) despite its popularity, record of success and acceptance by most of the industry. His proposal is of dubious legality. But should it succeed, the only real winners will be the cable and phone industries [the tube owners], which will gain yet another way to raise prices for everyone. The proposal is the epitome of senseless government action and sharply out of step with Mr. Trump’s populist mandate. Did Trump voters really vote for higher cable bills? In addition: The more convincing explanations for this change are more straightforward — and darker — than Mr. Pai’s. Much of Silicon Valley and Hollywood have supported both net neutrality and the Democratic Party, making an attack on the policy a kind of punishment. If Mr. Pai’s reasoning sounds forced and unconvincing, it is because this proposal comes right from the swamp, and can be attractive only to those who have lived there long enough to no longer notice the stench. And the World Wide Web Foundation concludes: Today Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Ajit Pai made clear he intends to dismantle strong net neutrality protections in the US. If approved, his plan would reverse a 2015 FCC ruling to reclassify internet service providers (ISPs) as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. The 2015 regulation was key for the roll-out of effective and enforceable net neutrality rules that would prevent ISPs from arbitrarily slowing down, or even blocking, internet traffic. Our founder, Sir Tim Berners-Lee said: “When I invented the web, I didn’t have to ask anyone for permission, and neither did America’s successful internet entrepreneurs when they started their businesses. To reach its full potential, the internet must remain a permissionless space for creativity, innovation and free expression. In today’s world companies can’t operate without internet, and access to it is controlled by just a few providers. The FCC’s announcements today suggest they want to step back and allow concentrated market players to pick winners and losers online. Their talk is all about getting more people connected, but what is the point if your ISP only lets you watch the movies they choose, just like the old days of cable?” Or throttles the small sites so the big sites get a smidgeon more speed? Contacting the FCC Here, in detail, is how to comment on the new FCC proposal, with the screen you will see: Just like last time, you can comment on net neutrality using the FCC’s same old archaic and weird comments system, but this time it should have the back end to support a ton of traffic. This comment process will happen in two waves. Right now, you can comment on the draft proposal, which has lots of questions about how the final proposal should be worded. The second comment cycle will be about the official proposal, will begin after May 18 and will be open for three months. You should be able to comment on both. Here’s how to do it now: Head to the listing for the “Restoring Internet Freedom” proposal (you can also search for Docket 17-108), which is perhaps the most ludicrously self-serving and false title we’ve seen in a while. Most of us can just click on “+ Express” on the left sidebar. This will send you to a simplified submission form. If you want to send more info, like attachments and images, use the “+New Filing” option. Fill out out the form and click on “Continue to review screen” when you’re finished. Review your comment, then send it off. You will need to include your name, home address, and phone number. All of that will be publicly accessible. That’s just part of the deal here. It couldn’t hurt if you contacted your Congress critter as well. Letters to the Editor are also very effective, so do write one to your local newspaper. And if you have other suggestions, please leave them in comments! Conclusion Naked Capitalism is a small blog. It’s in our interest — and we like to think it’s in your interest too, dear readers, and in the public interest as well — to be just as accessible to the public on the Internet as a giant site like the Washington Post or the New York Times (or Facebook). If you agree, please support Naked Capitalism and all small blogs by vociferously supporting network neutrality in every venue available to you. Help Naked Capitalism stay unthrottled! NOTES [1] Here let me note the disgraceful role of the NAACP, and other players in the Black Misleadership Class, in opposing net neutrality after collecting cash from ISPs. Ka-ching. [2] Pai also gave a remarkable speech at the Newseum: Pai said that his predecessor’s net neutrality rules were “all about politics,” in a speech at the Newseum in Washington on Wednesday. “Two years ago, I warned that we were making a serious mistake,” Pai said. “It’s basic economics: The more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you’re likely to get.” You know, like food. Or water. Or air. Shaking my head… 004107 This entry was posted in Banana republic, Guest Post, Infrastructure, Regulations and regulators, Technology and innovation on April 29, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

The picture above says it all. This site is a great example of what the Internet can and should be, and it demonstrates one right way (not necessarily the only way) of going about it. There are no ads, because you’re not selling anything. You provide an excellent service that people are willing to support you for, but it’s all voluntary. Compare this to endless pages and pages of garbage whose only purpose is convince, cajole, or otherwise manipulate someone into clicking a link to a commercial site selling crap that no one needs or wants. The signal to noise ratio is abysmal, and net neutrality is something that helps to reign in the exploitation. Because the Internet is such a powerful tool, with immense potential for positive change, I believe the way this battle goes, and the fate what the Internet is to ultimately become is of great importance. Also, say what you want about Obama, he did end up supporting and helping this particular cause. What good it will do, remains to be seen I guess. Reply ↓ Vatch April 29, 2017 at 4:26 pm Also, say what you want about Obama, he did end up supporting and helping this particular cause. I agree. Obama was a giant disappointment, but Trump is clearly worse. I’m still furious at the Democratic Party for giving us such a terrible choice in the recent Presidential election. As we all know, some people voted for Trump simply because Clinton was so very bad. As for Trump, he’s the one who chose Ajit Pai to be the chairman of the FCC, so Trump shares the blame for this fiasco. Reply ↓ hal April 29, 2017 at 5:41 pm Obama also appointed Pai to the FCC Trump made him Chairman. This would not have stopped Trump from doing his dirty work but Obama (You know $400,000 per speech) set the wheels in motion. Reply ↓ Vatch April 29, 2017 at 7:16 pm Right now, there are two vacancies on the FCC. No more than 3 members of the commission can belong to the same political party, and we currently have 2 Republicans and 1 Democrat. Trump withdrew Obama’s renomination of Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel. Prior to that, the Republican Senate sat on her renomination for more than a year (reminiscent of Merrick Garland). http://thehill.com/policy/technology/322064-trump-drops-former-fcc-dems-renomination-bid https://www.congress.gov/nomination/114th-congress/512 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Rosenworcel https://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/fcc-votes-for-net-neutrality-a-ban-on-paid-fast-lanes-and-title-ii/ FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said, “We cannot have a two-tiered Internet with fast lanes that speed the traffic of the privileged and leave the rest of us lagging behind. We cannot have gatekeepers who tell us what we can and cannot do and where we can and cannot go online, and we do not need blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization schemes that undermine the Internet as we know it.” Reply ↓ Marina Bart April 29, 2017 at 6:24 pm Also, say what you want about Obama, he did end up supporting and helping this particular cause. Especially since he has once again reared his head and is attempting to hypnotize American with his serpentine gaze, I think it’s really important we continually remember the reality of Barack Obama: – He was put in power to protect Wealth, FIRE and multi-national corporations. – His value to his masters relied and continues to rely on his mask of Goodness, which all his administration’s dirty deeds hid behind. – That was why the veal pen strategy was so important. Whenever anyone broke out of the pen long enough to pull on the mask until his real face was visible, he had to retreat. If he was ever fully exposed, the game was over — not so much for his masters, but for him. He and Michelle are young. For their turn at “foundation building,” obscene book deals, massive speaking fees, etc. to be maximally profitable, he had to exit the White House with his mask of Goodness in place. – In the late stages of his presidency, he was clearly anticipating that his successor would be the one left without a mask to wear, as public fury mounted at the after effects of what he had done. Hillary Clinton was perfect for this role: she’s used to be hated, she visibly enjoys hurting people, and she and her husband have already grifted hundreds of millions of dollars openly (I suspect there’s a lot more they control that’s hidden.) – Obama appointed Pai to the FCC. I don’t see why we should give Obama any credit at all for what happened in 2015. Major Democratic donors, like Google (aka Obama’s owners) were in favor of going common carrier, weren’t they? And that helped fuel the grassroots protests. His owners wanted common carrier, and citizens were pulling hard at his mask of Goodness. So he retreated, and got all sorts of praise for doing what was in the interests of major Democratic Party donors that Hillary was probably already hitting up for campaign donations. What am I missing? Reply ↓ Vatch April 29, 2017 at 7:17 pm Please see my reply to Hal on April 29, 2017 at 5:41 pm. Reply ↓ Marina Bart April 30, 2017 at 1:17 am Sorry, Vatch. I don’t see how that disproves anything I said. He gave the Republicans their majority and ability to stymie nominations, too. Reply ↓ Vatch April 30, 2017 at 12:30 pm If the Senate hadn’t blocked Obama’s renomination of Jessica Rosenworcel, there would currently be 2 Democrats and 2 Republicans on the FCC, and Ajit Pai wouldn’t have the votes that he needs to gut net neutrality. I don’t understand your what you mean by this: “He gave the Republicans their majority and ability to stymie nominations, too.” If you’re saying that he was an ineffective President, well yes, that’s true. But it’s the Republicans who are enthusiastic about killing net neutrality. In 2015, the net neutrality rule was passed by the FCC by a vote of 3-2 along party lines: https://www.cnet.com/news/net-neutrality-a-reality-fcc-votes-to-bring-internet-under-utility-style-rules/ Heck, if Tom Wheeler had chosen to remain on the FCC when Trump became President, even though he wouldn’t have been chairman any more, and the Republicans hadn’t blocked Rosenworcel, there would still be 3 Democrats and only 2 Republicans on the commission. On the topic of net neutrality, the Republicans are clearly worse than the Democrats. Reply ↓ Corbin Dallas April 30, 2017 at 8:42 am I believe you’re missing that Trump is the president and his party of thieving thugs are running Congress as well. There is nothing a Trump supporter won’t derail but blamIng *present* problems on the past without also implicating his/her current president. As Vatch said – there seems to be a lot more of us on the left that realizes that Obama was bad, HRC was bad, and Tramp is substantially more awful. It would be nice to see some acknowledgement from Trump supporters… Reply ↓ allan April 29, 2017 at 3:17 pm Pai said, “It’s basic economics: The more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you’re likely to get.” You would hope that an FCC chair could do better than spouting Econ 101 platitudes. Maybe the NC commentariat should chip in and buy Pai a copy of James Kwak’s Economism. Reply ↓ Carolinian April 29, 2017 at 4:31 pm A couple of points: while the neutrality rule did win the first round of court challenge it could still be shot down in court. In June 2016, in an 184-page ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, by a 2-1 vote, the FCC’s net neutrality rules and the FCC’s determination that broadband access is a public utility, rather than a luxury. AT&T and the telecom industry said that they would seek to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#United_States And the issue isn’t quite as simple as it may seem since video companies like Netflix absorb a large percentage of total web bandwidth and perhaps should be discriminated against. In which case the question would be who will do the discriminating, business or government. This link has a handy graph. http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/01/20/netflix-boasts-37-share-of-internet-traffic-in-north-america-compared-with-3-for-apples-itunes Reply ↓ hunkerdown April 29, 2017 at 5:23 pm I’ve worked as a lead engineer at an ISP. Services are only weakly associated with routing. Downloaded Internet traffic is only weakly associated with backbone Internet traffic. I’m a/bemused that you’re citing statistics from a deep-packet-inspection gear manufacturer whose products are designed to construct and meter non-neutral networks and which (and who) have no reason to exist in a neutral network. > video companies like Netflix fail at network design by hosting all their videos in a centralized location, rather than collocating shipping containers with ports for 10Gb Ethernet and however many amps of power at the network edge, like, say, YouTube. With ISP consolidation being what it is, that’s maybe 1000 servers scattered across the US and however many overseas. Not that I’m foily, but I see this as complementary to the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act, by which our “friends” at Google, Facebook and Twitter have announced information control initiatives (and whose stocks apparently jumped a bit on the news, as Mr. Haygood noted a few days ago). Reply ↓ Carolinian April 29, 2017 at 6:14 pm No need for foilly. In fact as I say below I believe “our friends” at the ISPs and major corporations need greater scrutiny when it comes to how they are changing the web. But I do question whether big investments in infrastructure so Netflix can more conveniently deliver House of Cards are warranted. The poorer customers subsidize all those investments in fiber, cell towers, frequency purchases etc and that creates a different form of discrimination in terms of access and rent seeking, at least here in the US. Which is to say IMO the big providers need more regulation, not less. Just declaring “net neutrality” isn’t enough. Since you work in this field happy to hear a contrary view. Reply ↓ hunkerdown April 29, 2017 at 9:48 pm Netflix hosts their entire service on the Amazon cloud, which is anything but free. I agree that Netflix benefits disproportionately from ISPs building direct pipes to Amazon as a prerequisite to reaching Netflix, as does no friend of ours Amazon and their cloud customers, as do to a lesser extent anyone else along the same route. I contest that subsidy is a useful frame to describe the apportionment of financing for a resource that can’t be stored and (as under net neutrality) can’t be reserved, in the same sense that building another common lane on a busy interstate constitutes a subsidy for UPS. According to the principles of a neutral network, the decision to discriminate against Netflix has the flip side of discriminating in favor of Amazon, who are the true culprits as far as network operations are concerned. I agree that network operators need to be regulated more; in fact, they need to be regulated into utilities much like sewerage, where one pays for the size of the outlet pipe to handle their effluent which indirectly pays for the facilities to process it according to volume, rather than discriminate according to how much soap is in the dish water or whatever. Of course, regulations in the USA are mostly orthogonal to enforcement actions, or Amazon would be paying for their customers’ effluent. Reply ↓ Kurtismayfield April 29, 2017 at 4:47 pm And the issue isn’t quite as simple as it may seem since video companies like Netflix absorb a large percentage of total web bandwidth and perhaps should be discriminated against. In which case the question would be who will do the discriminating, business or government. Netflix pays for every byte it uses. The end user pays for every byte it uses. There is no reason why the company should be discriminated against. This is like arguing that Uber shouldn’t be allowed to use highways that it and the customer has already paid for because people like it too much and it is causing traffic in some bottlenecked areas. Now, the only reason that ISP’s really have to ban Netflix is because they directly compete against them in the content delivery business. This was in reply to Carolinian Reply ↓ Carolinian April 29, 2017 at 5:11 pm Since most ISPs offer flat rate pricing then low bandwidth users who never watch Netflix or other video services are in fact subsidizing the transfomation of the web into de facto cable tv and the activities of those video lovers. This has become much more of an issue with cell tower internet where available bandwidth is more limited. If I’m not mistaken it’s the rise of smartphones and their consumption of video that has really brought this issue to the fore after so many years of net neutrality being less of an issue. To offer a more accurate analogy than your Uber example, electricity is priced according to the nature of the use and so there is in fact a form of “discrimination” in that regulated industry. The truth is that the common carrier designation is a bit of a copout and free speech access to the internet should be part of much more intrusive government regulation. But that of course assumes that we have governments that care about free speech. At any rate what I’m saying is that it’s a complicated issue and not just about ISP greed, no matter how greedy they may be. Reply ↓ hunkerdown April 29, 2017 at 5:35 pm Carolinian, unrealistic analogy. Bandwidth unused is not “saved”. It is, in fact, wasted and lost forever. What, exactly, is the cost difference between a 0% utilized lit fiber and a 100% utilized lit fiber? Aside from a very minor increase in power consumption at either end of the link to handle the information, approximately nil. Shared network media are not comparable to packet-switched network media. A river is a better analogy: use it or lose it, but leave enough for others. We would be far better off if network providers would replace broadcast television “channels” entirely with network bandwidth and stop oversubscribing their internet links to wherever it is their users want to go. That means Netflix traffic gets just as degraded as everyone else when a particular link in the chain is overloaded, and boo hoo for their viewers. Reply ↓ Carolinian April 29, 2017 at 7:06 pm In the neighborhood where I live ATT is in the process of replacing copper lines with fiber so they are in fact making the river bigger just as the power company has to build expensive dams or power plants in response to anticipated demand and that investment is then covered by rate payers. I’m not sure the analogy is wrong. The intent, it seems, is to turn the web into cable tv on demand and if that is where we are going then web becomes a big infrastructure, big investment proposition and commericalization a greater concern. I understand that a lot of this infrastructure is already in place and therefore why not use it, but my read is that much bigger plans are afoot and this may be why the net neutrality issue is now coming to a head. Admittedly this is not exactly what the above post is talking about but perhaps worth discussion. Reply ↓ Yves Smith May 1, 2017 at 2:12 am I have a friend who ran an ISP and separately built mission-critical trading platforms on Wall Street. He says there is no need to meter broadband. The architecture of last mile to the home, if you are using AT&T and not cable, is that your pipe is your own. Giving you fiber does NOT have to do with you needing the higher speed. I can run Netflix on copper. AT&T and others are trying to get rid of copper because it is more expensive to maintain. If you don’t insist (as in really really insist) that your copper connection not be messed with, they will sever it permanently at the time of a fiber optic install. Reply ↓ Joe T. April 29, 2017 at 8:31 pm We’ve seen large orders of magnitude increases of bandwidth as technology developed from T1 to fiber optic wavelength division multiplexing. This occurred in a decade or two. But now we’re incentivizing internet providers to NOT progress, because if we all have fast enough speeds, they lose their cash cow of “premium” extra-cost service. Capitalism works well when the incentives are exactly right. They seem exactly wrong in this case. Reply ↓ Barry April 30, 2017 at 12:11 pm I agree. In order to get someone to pay for faster service, you have to guarantee that someone else will get slower service.

The only way to hit them where they live, is to make them hurt, just like the low power FM station dispute some years ago. When thousands of low-power stations put themselves on the air (mostly without permission) , the plutocrats and FCC both found themselves SOL, and made the rules much easier. There are thousands of unused, empty UHF channels; although there are some easy rules for their use, starting a internet/TV flood would be simple, and very productive for many new enterprises and local interests. Stand by for the plutocrat screams! Reply ↓ mle detroit April 30, 2017 at 11:51 am The new rules, approved 3 to 2 along party lines, are intended to ensure that no content is blocked and that the Internet is not divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for Internet and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else. Those prohibitions are hallmarks of the net neutrality concept….Ajit Pai, a Republican commissioner, said the rules were government meddling in a vibrant, competitive market and were likely to deter investment, undermine innovation and ultimately harm consumers. Why is Pai being allowed to frame this is an issue for “consumers” rather than “citizens”? Our younger citizens get most of their civic information via the internet. Reply ↓ Kalen April 30, 2017 at 1:58 pm Thank you. Another great and timely subject but again put in a little too narrow perspective, I think too narrow to appropriately assess true interests and choices internet users should face in this debate. Also liberally applied quotes from Senator Ted Stevens, Google or Art Technica and similar truly corporate lobbyist interests as well as open endorsement of NN by NC editors really question the very NEUTRALITY of this article itself. I hope my contrarian voice will be allowed to be heard in this vital debate on NC. Again, in my opinion, the conversation about net neutrality seems to have been purposefully obfuscated and confused. It is really sad but not unexpected, that many relatively small sites push an idea that they are being threatened by what they call themselves Net Neutrality rejection by the current administration which I myself oppose. Before engaging in any meaningful debate, first, let’s address what Net Neutrality (NN) really is theoretically, devoid of vague characterizations that mean different things to different people, namely a rule that all the sources of IP packets regardless of their range, type or protocols, (TCP/IP … or higher level: http(s), DAV, ftp, … VoIP, video, encryption, general file transfer or streaming etc.,) must be treated equally and processed with no other algorithmic manipulation than the congestion handling technical measures. In fact it is often simplistically interpreted, by NN advocates as it means no preferential treatment of big websites over smaller websites regardless what they stream and what intermittent traffic fluctuations they may attract i.e. no content, type nor volume arbitrary limitation. But this is only one possible interpretation of NN, one of many that actually do not require “protection” of small website from being able to access their traffic and hence mostly used by giants of Internet like Google, FB as a cover for what they really meant and still what NN means for them in a category of business profit and growth, not necessarily a stand for principles they are happy to break elsewhere when money is good. The fact is that during last few years under legal NN massive preferences for giants of Internet were achieved by technical means via countless $billions of spending by Google, FB, NETFLIX etc.,. Most of them built their own access to Internet backbone or invested in it to get priority access while the rest of us going already through highly congested, in many cases purposefully congested by artificially limiting capacities/throughoutput in/out of Internet Backbone accessing routers to only half of their capacity or refusing to upgrade them to new faster models as such a practice has been disclosed few years ago. All those “in effect”, discriminative measures freely, openly implemented while no NN laws have been violated!!! Do we really care about such a law that truly does nothing practical to level plain field for small Internet players? But in a Orwellian style many advocates of NN want us to look away and not just anywhere, not particularly where there are many more issues of critical concern to public but at the specific place namely at Last Mile Internet usurpers corporate behemoths of ATT, Verizon etc .,. I have no love lost for these corporate oligopolies and I agree that they are a real threat to the Internet since they have tyrannical power to cut of Internet audience from their trusted websites (if they still exist). However, my problem is that they are already doing it, petrifying people with their monopolistic price gouging. What people should be outraged about is not only about unimpeded access to the Internet but the outrageous monopolistic prices extorted from vulnerable population where most of services and a lot of trade has been pushed into embedding them in everyday life. Why people in the US do not complain when a peasant in a God forsaken mountain village in France or South Korea can get at least 1 Gigabit/s speed internet for about $10 bucks a month if he is illegible for government subsidy. If he is the cost often drops to zero. Is this our real fight, as users, for Internet access worth fighting for? A theoretical so-called euphemistically “free-unimpeded NN” access is worth nothing if its costs are criminal, unaffordable and/or prohibiting. Or is this just a liberal astroturf phony righteous indignation of those who, as they often do, confuse peoples’ rights with paid access privileges for those who can afford to be free? The core of the issue of NN access is affordability achieved by turning Internet into a simple price controlled utility as in many other countries they practically did under many different schemes. For Internat users in digital age Internet access affordability is a basic right and warrants government subsidies, as current laws provide, but paid from taxes on profits of the monopolists not users. If we cap internet price to say flat $10 a month, all those greedy corporates will quit the market, opening the field to massive city and state government investments to step in as they are now blocked by Wall Street oligarchs from doing so. Ultimately, Is it not a better fight to fight for one conglomerated utility (electric, gas, oil coal, etc., internet/phone/data/mobile) package say, $10 per family and corporate usurpers. Unfortunately, what some so-called advocates want us really to stand for and fight for are propagandists Netflix, Goggle, YT, Tweeter, FB and more silicon Valley billionaires avoiding paying to other corporates. This is not really our fight unless NN affordable Internet is discussed as well. The whole NN issue stems from utter refusal by the Wall Street in invest in telecom infrastructure in the US in last decade trying to protect and expand their profit by using old criminal monopolistic practices to strangle population access to information that threatens to expose corporate and government criminally of Internet players among others. One may argue that some of the Internet infrastructure access regression is a part of long policies of the US regime to de-industrialize America, collapse entire US infrastructure and to push Americans into a civilization digital Dark Age in every social dimension. Reply ↓ Lambert Strether Post authorMay 1, 2017 at 12:39 am My hot take: The Internet should remain a common carrier — the topic of the article — and we should put ginormous WiFi antenna on top of every Post Office so every American has free Internet, instead of dorking around at the municipal level. (I can see that “ginormous WiFi antenna” might be an overly simplistic technical approach, but you see what I mean).

The Kitty Hawk Flyer prototype. It is one of several prototypes the startup, based in Mountain View, Calif., is designing.  (Courtesy Kitty Hawk / TNS)   By John MarkoffThe New York Times Sun., April 30, 2017 CLEARLAKE, CALIF.—On a recent afternoon, an aerospace engineer working for a small Silicon Valley company called Kitty Hawk piloted a flying car above a scenic lake about 160 kilometres north of San Francisco. Kitty Hawk’s flying car, if you insisted on calling it a “car,” looked like something Luke Skywalker would have built out of spare parts. It was an open-seated, 100-kilogram contraption with room for one person, powered by eight battery-powered propellers that howled as loudly as a speedboat. The tech industry is fond of disrupting things, and lately the automakers have been a big target. Cars that use artificial intelligence to drive themselves, for example, have been in development for a few years and can be spotted on roads in a number of cities. And now, coming onto the radar screen are flying machines that do not exactly look like your father’s Buick with wings. Read more: Kitty Hawk Flyer, an electric flying vehicle, to go on sale this year Article Continued Below Veteran NASA engineer joins Uber to develop flying cars More than a dozen startups backed by deep-pocketed industry figures such as Larry Page, a Google founder — along with big aerospace firms like Airbus, the ride-hailing company Uber and even the government of Dubai — are taking on the dream of the flying car. The approaches by the companies vary and the realization of their competing visions seems far in the future, but they have one thing in common: a belief that one day regular people should be able to fly their own vehicles around town. There are challenges, with both the technology and government regulations. Perhaps the biggest hurdle will be convincing the public that the whole idea isn’t crazy. “I love the idea of being able to go out into my backyard and hop into my flying car,” said Brad Templeton, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has served as a consultant on Google’s self-driving project. “I hate the idea of my next-door neighbour having one.” Kitty Hawk, the company backed by Page, is trying to be one of the first out of the gate and plans to start selling its vehicle by the end of the year. The company has attracted intense interest because of Page and its chief executive, Sebastian Thrun, an influential technologist and self-driving car pioneer who is the founding director of Google’s X lab. In 2013, Zee Aero, a Kitty Hawk division, became the object of Silicon Valley rumours when reports of a small air taxi-like vehicle first surfaced. Page declined a request for an interview but said in a statement: “We’ve all had dreams of flying effortlessly. I’m excited that one day very soon I’ll be able to climb onto my Kitty Hawk Flyer for a quick and easy personal flight.” During his recent test flight, Cameron Robertson, the aerospace engineer, used two joystick-like controls to swing the vehicle back and forth above Clear Lake. The flight, just 4.5 metres above the water, circled over the lake about 18 to 27 metres from shore, and after about five minutes Robertson steered back to a floating landing pad at the end of a dock. The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of several prototypes the startup, based in Mountain View, Calif., is designing. The company hopes to create an audience of enthusiasts and hobbyists, who can now pay $100 (U.S.) to sign up for a $2,000 discount on the retail price of a Flyer to “gain exclusive access to Kitty Hawk experiences and demonstrations where a select few will get the chance to ride the Flyer.” It is an unusual offer, since the company has not yet set a price for the vehicle, and Thrun’s and Page’s involvement can be taken as evidence that the company is aiming far beyond hobbyists. Still, Kitty Hawk is clearly targeting a new kind of transportation — air flight that can be performed safely by most people and hopefully with government approval. “We have been in contact with the FAA, and we see the regulators as friends,” Thrun said in an interview. He agreed that concerns about vehicles flying over our heads were legitimate. “I believe that all of us have to work together to understand how new technologies will shape the future of society,” he said. Two years ago, Thrun recruited two other pioneers, Robertson and Todd Reichert who were aerospace engineers from AeroVelo, a University of Toronto spinoff company that won a coveted prize for a human-powered helicopter and set the land speed record for a bicycle last year. They are flying under a special U.S. Federal Aviation Administration category for ultralight aircraft that does not require a pilot’s licence and is intended for recreational flying in uncongested areas. To add an extra margin of safety, the Kitty Hawk engineers are sticking to flying over open water. The company said the final commercial product will look different and be far quieter than the test model. “We hope that this is more of an exciting concept than what most people have had in their minds about flying cars,” Robertson said. “This is not yet that product in terms of what we will say and what it can do, but I think it demonstrates a vision of the future.” Kitty Hawk could face stiff competition, not just from about a half dozen startups, but from giant Airbus, based in Blagnac, France. The aerospace firm has announced two vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, concepts and is reported to be planning an initial test flight before the end of the year. At the Geneva International Motor Show last month, Airbus proposed an autonomous vehicle, named “Pop.Up,” that would operate on both the ground and in the air. And this year, the government of Dubai, in partnership with a Chinese firm, EHang, said it planned to begin operating an autonomous flying taxi by this July. Also, Uber is expected on Tuesday to detail its “vision for the future of Urban Air Mobility” at a conference in Dallas. There is no shortage of skeptics happy to point out the roadblocks for these vehicles. There is already significant resistance to the idea of unmanned drones flying over urban areas, and flying cars could face substantial opposition, even if they can be quieted to automotive noise levels. For these personal air vehicles to become a reality in the United States, the country would need a whole new air traffic control system. Two years ago, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration began development of an air traffic control system meant for managing all sorts of flying vehicles, including drones. One NASA developer described it as an air traffic control system, “for a sky dark with drones.” Researchers hope testing can begin by 2019. Batteries are also an issue. While electric propeller-driven motors seem promising, today’s battery technology cannot support flights of a reasonable distance, say a 50- or 80-kilometre commute. “How is this going to work? I don’t want to be a Debbie Downer, but we can’t even take our cellphones on airplanes today because of fears about battery fires,” said Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University, who is researching personal air transport for NASA. And don’t forget that flying cars will not be able to pull to the side of the road in an emergency, said John Leonard, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. “Silicon Valley is full of very smart people, but they don’t always get the laws of physics,” he said. “Gravity is a formidable adversary.” Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

In the tutorial below, I will tell you how to do that without G Suite. All you have to do is sign in Google Classroom, create a class and invite your students via their Gmail. And then you can do various things in it such as creating questions, add topics, give assignments, and many more. And all the changes made in the classroom are reflected in real-time. If you have ever used Google Classroom, then you know that it requires G Suite. But, now Google has announced that anyone having Gmail account can create an online classroom. The classroom has an intuitive interface and a good environment for teachers and students. Sponsored Links So, let’s see the process to create online Google Classroom using Gmail address. How to Create Online Google Classroom Using Gmail Address? Google Classroom is a very good platform for teachers to interact with their students. The teachers can invite their students to take part in the classroom. And then teachers can post questions, assignments in the classroom. The questions asked in the classroom are visible to all the students, but the answers can only be seen by the teacher. Also, there is an indicator to show which students have given the answer to the question and which ones haven’t. There is also an option to create a grade sheet from all or selected students. And the teachers can export the grade-book as a CSV file. There are some other features also in Google Classroom such as sending an email to specific student, changing theme of the classroom, question can also be asked by the students, etc. But, teachers can specify an option to inhibit students from asking or posting anything in the classroom. Follow these simple steps to create online Google Classroom using Gmail address. Step 1: Visit Google Classroom and sign in using your Gmail account. After that, you will be able to see the classroom interface which will be blank at first. Step 2: Click on the “+” icon to create a class, and then a pop-up will appear where you will have to specify some class related parameters such as class name, section, and class subject. Specify all these parameters and then proceed. Step 3: Next, you will have to invite students to your class using their email address. Use the students tab form the class to do that. Step 4: After you have invited all your students, you can start posting questions and assignments. Use the circular badge from the bottom right side of the interface. And while you are posting a question, you can specify certain choices such as whether students can edit the answer, due date, students can reply to each other, ask question to specific students only, schedule the question, etc. See the below screenshot. Step 5: Now, after posting your question you will be able to see which students have answered the questions and which ones have not. And as the students will start answering the questions, you will be able to see them without refreshing the page. And the corresponding status will keep changing accordingly. Step 6: After all the students have answered the question or the Due date has reached, then you can create the grade book of the students. To do this, just click on the question for which you want to give grades to students. After that, a new page will open up, where you will see the list of students and their corresponding answers. And according to the answers, you can give points to students out of 100. Also if you want, then you can download the grades as a CSV file for yourself. So, in this way you can easily create online Google Classroom using Gmail address. And Google Classroom has made it pretty easy to do this. However, there is one limitation that there is no online video conference or chat. But, still this service is quite better than others. And very useful to the teachers who want to teach students online. Final Words Google Classroom is very good platform to create online classroom. And I really like few things about it such as asking questions, assignments to all or specific students, status of the homework, etc. And it allows you to send email to a student individually. So, if you are a teacher and looking for ways to create an online classroom, then you can give it a try. I am sure that it will not disappoint you in any way.

What We Use, 2017 Edition: The stuff Corbin can't live without Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/28 8:26am PDTApr 28, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 21 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares75 Features What We Use Series Article Contents 1 Hardware 1.0.1 Phone: Google Pixel 1.0.2 Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 1.0.3 Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' 1.0.4 Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') 1.0.5 Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) 1.0.6 Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 1.0.7 Smart speaker: Google Home 1.0.8 Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE 1.0.9 Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 1.0.10 Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock 2 Software 2.0.1 Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) 2.0.2 Signal Spy (Android) 2.0.3 InputMapper (Windows) 2.0.4 Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) 3 Conclusion You may recall Android Police's long-running 'What We Use' series, where the fantastic people that work here share the tech (and sometimes non-tech) products they use on a frequent basis. I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police!

I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently? Corbin Davenport I'm still using the Developer Preview on it, since I don't think the final 2.0 release has been pushed to it yet. I don't really use Assistant on it, though. Orlando aka Pixel XL I have surface pro 4 connected to dock station with two monitors. LG watch sport and pixel XL/Samsung Galaxy S8+ How is that programming application? I use pycharm and enthought canopy which r awful! Corbin Davenport You mean Sublime Text? Like I said in the post, it's great. Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. JasonIvers Just use Cloudflare... They provide SSL, as well as DDOS protection, etc, for free. It takes basically no work, or even much knowledge, to set it up. Then, if you want to do your own later, you can, but people will be able to use https on the mean time. Artem Russakovskii We already do use Cloudflare, including their SSL, but it's not so simple with our setup for reasons I don't want to explain. We made it work on apkmirror already, and AP is coming. Jan-Lk Else What about let's encrypt? Artem Russakovskii Yup, using that too, underneath Cloudflare. The certs themselves are not the issue, it's making sure everything works on both http and https pages, including various caching we have, so there's no mixed content warning. Then once that all works, like it does on apkmirror.com, I'll force everything to https. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Da Fuq Agreed, but it's gonna be pretty expensive. New CPU, MB and DDR4 RAM. JD Still cheaper than an Intel setup. Once you consider the performance gain you can't afford to not upgrade Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers. Michael Hazell Must be nice to be able to afford expensive devices like the Pixel. I maintain my stance that there really hasn't been a successor to the OnePlus One since its inception because no future model has come to its price point.

Shira Ovide Facebook is harnessing its nearly 2 billion users and army of developers to try to murder Snapchat. Photo: Reuters New York: In the last week or two, I’ve read several thought-provoking pieces about giant technology companies that have grown into monopolies and perhaps should be broken up like the old AT&T. Cries of monopoly are not a new phenomenon for tech. Just ask Google. But this latest round of hand-wringing feels different. For one, it’s not just coming from the usual anti-corporate worrywarts; people from deep in the Silicon Valley hive mind are among those concerned about whether a handful of businesses have become too big for the industry’s own good. And two, it’s not a single tech titan that people fear has grown dangerously powerful, but at least three—Google, Facebook and Amazon—at once. Click here for enlarge Tech titans’ dominance is an inescapable subject in Silicon Valley, and it seems no one is immune from fears of being run over. “As a smaller company relative to the tech giants ... it’s not negotiable that we have to move really, really quickly ... Otherwise you get eliminated,” Pinterest’s CEO said on a recent episode of Bloomberg’s Decrypted podcast. And Pinterest is not a tiny start-up but a company valued at $11 billion. The power of technology giants is even too much for a merely big company. A favourite concept in tech circles is Ben Thompson’s Aggregation Theory, which lays out why the big in technology tend to get even bigger, although in ways different from a nasty monopolist that uses its power to force up prices. People don’t pay Google parent company Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. for anything, so there is no price gouging. Product prices at Amazon might go down, not up, and shopping there is convenient. People like using Google, Facebook and Amazon.com Inc. The tech giants have monopolies by popular choice. That doesn’t mean their dominance can’t take its toll. If you have a product and it is not for sale on Amazon—or if it’s not available for free shipping to Prime customers—it might as well not exist. If you record a video and the algorithms at Google and Facebook don’t give it prominence, it is invisible. Facebook is harnessing its nearly 2 billion users and army of developers to try to murder Snapchat. One of the most interesting pieces about technology I have read this year was from an unlikely source: the Yale Law Journal. The article in January argues that US legal doctrine became too narrowly focused on higher consumer prices as evidence of monopoly power and therefore is ill-equipped to deal with today’s technology superpowers. (The piece was about Amazon, but elements of it were applicable broadly to the internet economy. It’s worth reading alone for the reference to a Supreme Court case about pie.) The idea is that these network effects—the growing usefulness of an online service as it gains more users, consumer data and suppliers—can be just as damaging as jacking up supermarket prices. It’s hard to imagine our lawmakers trying a Glass-Steagall Act to separate Amazon’s retail business from its marketplace operation, as the Yale article suggests. But it is clear the fears about tech’s Too Powerful to Fail are only getting worse.

An estimated 536 million Indians are expected to use regional languages while online by 2021, complemented by increasing affordability of devices and data charges and availability of more local content, a report by Google-KPMG says. The report estimates that Hindi Internet users (at 201 million) will outnumber those accessing the web in English at 199 million by 2021. India is expected to have 735 million Internet users by the same time from 409 million in 2016. Interestingly, a significant number of Indian language Internet users already access government services, classifieds, news and payment services "exclusively online". Indic language users are not just accessing chat apps and digital entertainment but are also opting for digital payments methods. In 2016, the total number of Internet users who accessed Internet in Indian languages and English stood at 234 million and 175 million, respectively. Apart from Hindi, Marathi and Bengali users are expected to drive volume growth, while Tamil, Kannada and Telegu users are expected to be among the most digitally engaged through 2016 to 2021. Marathi, Bengali, Tamil and Telugu online users are expected to form almost one-third of the total Indic language user base. "Growth in user base will be complemented by increasing penetration of Internet enabled devices, availability of affordable high speed Internet, rising digital literacy and Indian language enablement of the ecosystem bringing and engaging more Indian language users online," the report says. Given that nine out of 10 new Internet users in India are likely to be an Indic language user, Google has been ramping support for Indian languages across its various products like Maps and Search.This will ensure that more people can access Internet in a language of their choice. tags #Business #Technology #Telecom Related news Business Patanjali to wipe out MNCs from Indian market in 5 years: Baba Ramdev May 01, 2017 10:20 AM Business BS-3 ban: Tractors, CEVs become collateral damage May 01, 2017 10:09 AM Business BSE to place trading restrictions on 161 firms from May 5 Apr 30, 2017 03:50 PM Business Jet Airways to review pilots' pay hike freeze after Q1 results Apr 30, 2017 03:45 PM Business High staff, marketing expenses cost Ola 6 crore each day in FY16 Apr 30, 2017 03:40 PM Business Ban on red beacons aimed at ending VIP culture mindset: PM Narendra Modi Apr 30, 2017 02:15 PM Business When Baba Ramdev quit govt school, fled home to join gurukul Apr 30, 2017 02:05 PM Business 536 million users to log onto Internet in Indian languages by 2021 Apr 30, 2017 12:40 PM Business Telecom subscriber base in India grows to 1.18 billion in February: Trai Apr 30, 2017 12:30 PM News Most Popular Top News Stay with winners! 100 stocks which rose to lifetime high in April gave up to 127% return Hindustan Zinc posts 42% rise in Q4 profit at Rs 3,057 cr, margin expands 940 bps Vijay Mallya gifted $40 million to his children, funnelled Rs 3200 crore overseas: ED’s dossier EC to get 30,000 new VVPAT machines by July for Guj, HP polls Will the Nifty touch 9400? 8 factors that can shape the market this week Seven of top 10 cos add Rs 49,642 crore in market cap; HDFC Bank leads the charge What different states are doing to water down the rules, and give builders an escape hatch Petrol, diesel prices to be revised daily from May see more Video of the day Have suggested various proposals for NPA resolution to the ministries: NITI Aayog Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Game Changers Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch PowerYourTrade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info feedback@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

A mesh network could solve most, if not all, of your Wi-Fi problems. It’s basically a system of multiple Wi-Fi stations that work together to blanket every corner of your home with a strong wireless data connection. Unlike stand-alone routers that lose signal the farther you move away from them, mesh stations piggyback on one another to create a continuous wireless link throughout your home, minimising the possibility of dead zones. The network technology is quickly becoming popular: After the startup Eero released a mesh system last year, bigger brands like Google and D-Link followed with similar products. Obviously, large houses with many rooms would benefit from multiple Wi-Fi hubs. But based on my tests with several mesh systems over the last year, I would go a step further and recommend a mesh network for most people, including those with modestly sized homes, for a variety of reasons. For one, mesh Wi-Fi systems like Eero and Google Wifi include intuitive smartphone apps that make managing your network easier to understand. For another, some mesh systems are aesthetically pleasing — unlike traditional routers, which are bulky contraptions of hideous antennas that look as if they were made on the Death Star. Most important, mesh networks better accommodate a shift in how people use technology today. We carry mobiles devices like smartphones, smart watches, laptops and tablets from room to room. Internet-connected gadgets like smart speakers, bathroom scales and smart televisions are also increasingly scattered throughout the home. With mesh networks, your Wi-Fi coverage has less chance of being interrupted. “It’s really nice to see the router vendors doing something that is properly useful for once,” said Dave Fraser, the chief executive of Devicescape, a tech company that helps make public Wi-Fi networks more reliable for mobile phone service. “It’s like they’ve finally realised it’s human beings buying these products rather than IT staff.” I tested three popular Wi-Fi systems: Eero, Google Wifi and Netgear’s Orbi. All were solid, though my favourite was Eero. Here’s what you need to know about mesh networks when picking one that suits your home: Advantages of Mesh First, a primer on how a mesh system works. You connect a primary base station to your broadband modem. From there, you connect satellite stations in rooms where you might get weak coverage. Let’s say your primary base station is in the downstairs living room, and you have a satellite station in the upstairs office. When you are in the office and loading a webpage on a laptop, the primary base station retrieves the webpage data and bounces it to the satellite station, which then beams it to your computer in the office in what’s known as a hop. “It’s like taking a flight where you can’t fly direct, but you can fly indirectly through a hub,” Fraser said. “If you go into the back room, there’s no signal. The only way you can get there is through two shorter flights.” In addition to expanding your Wi-Fi range, a mesh system helps your device automatically connect to the strongest station as you move about the house. When you’re in the living room, your smartphone will automatically pull a signal from the station there; when you move to the bedroom, your smartphone will seamlessly switch to the station there. That’s better than what we could do with older router setups. With a traditional Wi-Fi router, your signal would degrade the farther you move from the base station. You could boost a Wi-Fi router’s connection with an extender station. But in that situation, you would have to manually connect your device to the extender’s Wi-Fi network, and when you moved away from the extender, you would have to manually switch back to the main router’s Wi-Fi network. That’s a pain. Finally, mesh systems like Eero, which looks like a sleek white hub with rounded corners, and Google Wifi, which is a white cylindrically shaped device, aren’t eyesores. So you need not be shy about putting the Wi-Fi hubs out in the open, like on a side table, for a clear line of sight with your gadgets. It isn’t perfect The main downside of a mesh network is that you lose some speed with every so-called hop. Let’s say that your primary Wi-Fi station is in the living room, you have a satellite hub in the basement, and in between those two rooms there is another satellite hub in the garage. In the basement, your speeds will be slower, because the primary router makes a copy of the data as it hops to the satellite in the garage, and then the satellite in the garage produces another copy that reaches the satellite in the basement. As a result, it will take more time for that data to travel to your device via the basement hub. Despite the sluggishness, that is still better than getting a crummy signal or no connection at all in the basement if you had just one router. Netgear’s Orbi works differently than traditional mesh systems. It has a dedicated Wi-Fi band, or connection, in which only the router and satellites can talk to each other; no other devices can interfere with their connection. Hence Orbi’s hubs can transfer data more quickly to one another than systems like Eero and Google Wifi can. The other downside of a mesh system is they are not cheap. A pack of three Eero devices costs about $400, Google Wifi costs about $300 for a pack of three, and Netgear’s Orbi with a router and one wall-plug satellite costs $300. Google says the rule of thumb for choosing a package is that each access point covers about 1,500 sq feet of space. But configurations will vary depending on the layout of your home and the materials inside your walls. In my roughly 1,100-square-foot apartment, I needed two access points because my main rooms are separated by a long hallway. Test results In my tests with Eero, Google Wifi and Netgear’s Orbi, all were quite fast in each room. The Orbi delivered the speediest results overall, and Eero and Google Wifi performed roughly the same. The Wirecutter, the product recommendations site owned by The New York Times, tested multiple mesh systems in a large house and also found Orbi to be the fastest, strongest system. Yet speed isn’t everything. Eero’s app was the easiest to understand, which made setting up and checking on the status of the Wi-Fi system extremely smooth. Google Wifi’s app was also intuitive, though less polished than Eero’s. Netgear’s Orbi had the clunkiest setup, requiring an arcane web browser interface to get started, and the configuration language would probably be intimidating for those who are not information technology professionals. In addition, the Orbi, which looks like a water purifier pitcher, is the bulkiest and ugliest of the three, so you may feel tempted to hide it behind a pile of books, which would weaken its signal. Consumers would probably be happy with any of these systems compared to a traditional router. If speed is your top priority, consider the Orbi. If price is a concern, go with a Google Wifi package. Or if your goal is to make Wi-Fi less of a headache for you or a loved one, buy an Eero system. If you live in a tiny space, like a studio apartment, a mesh network is probably overkill. But you may still want to consider buying a single Eero or Google Wifi hub to take advantage of their intuitive apps for managing your Wi-Fi. The complexity of Wi-Fi is what inspired Eero’s chief executive, Nick Weaver, to create a mesh product. Years ago, he grew frustrated with getting phone calls from his parents begging for help whenever their Internet connections failed. “If something broke, there were no logs to understand how to improve it,” Weaver said. “This kept driving me crazier and crazier.” He ended up plugging his parents’ networking gear into a surge protector and labeling the power button “Internet kill switch” for them to easily reset their Internet connection whenever it went down. Now his parents use Eero’s mesh system — and love it, Weaver said.

But even as sources inside the high-profile group report ongoing challenges, the drone unit is preparing an important update to demonstrate progress that's expected in a matter of weeks. Popular Searches Tribune Media Co TRCO ▼ 36.56 -0.28 -0.76% Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOX ▼ 29.86 -0.07 -0.23% Epigenomics AG EPGNY ▲ 38.35 +0.15 +0.39% Micron Technology Inc MU ▲ 27.67 +0.04 +0.14% Business Insider has heard from multiple people that a group of employees left the team this week. And despite getting a big shout-out from Alphabet CEO Larry Page in a recent public letter, Project Wing is still not close to being ready to launch, according to a person familiar with the matter. Our sources are calling the latest job reductions at Wing a layoff, however an X spokesperson explains that these cuts are not new but rather the final part of the reorganization that began in January, shortly after the departure of the unit's leader Dave Vos in the fall. Employees were informed back then that their jobs were going away and they had until mid-April to land another one elsewhere including within Google. Some of the affected employees managed to get hired into new groups, while others are no longer employed by Alphabet. "X (and Alphabet generally) typically gives people time and support to find new roles when there are changes in teams/projects," a spokesperson told Business Insider. Ambitious initiatives like Project Wing, which is trying to invent a drone that can deliver packages, is by definition a risky undertaking with no guarantee of success.  Wing is part of X, formerly known as Google X, which is the company's R&D unit working on far-out "moonshot" projects, racing against Amazon and drone makers like DJI to usher in what may one day be a massive new market, delivering everything from food to medicine straight to people's doorsteps. Stress test All told, since January, between layoffs and people quitting, Project Wing's workforce has been reduced by about 10%. However, that's not very many people, less than a dozen. We understand that Wing employs about 70 people. The main team that has been dismantled with Project Wing's reorganization is the one that was working business product strategy, doing things like crafting partnerships with Chipotle and Starbucks, the Wall Street Journal reported last fall and a source close to the project confirmed with Business Insider. A potential partnership with Starbucks was nixed when that happened, as Bloomberg reported at the time.  Project Wing has experienced a ton of change and turmoil since its beginnings in 2012 and has a reputation for stress and politics, more than one person familiar with the project has told us. One guy, who was working long hours out-of-doors testing the drone, even collapsed on the job and was briefly hospitalized, sources previously told us. He was later let go as part of the team's reorganization, people told us. It's not clear if Wing's disruptions will cease now that the final employees whose jobs were cut back in January have moved on. Grandfathered in The turmoil stems in part because Wing is one of X's earliest cornerstone projects, one person speculated to us. This project was created before Google reorganized itself into Alphabet and forced X to implement more stringent business analysis, hiring practices and cost controls on the projects it funded. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Dave Vos These days, it's difficult to get a job at X, we understand. People can no longer get hired into X just because one of their buddies works there, a marked change from earlier days when the so-called moonshot factory was a freewheeling hive of experimental projects. Wing's first leader was famed MIT robotics scientist Nick Roy, who worked there during a two year sabbatical then went back to his tenured job at MIT. Various engineers joined Wing during those earlier years, including people from MIT who followed Roy there and left when he did, our source told us. Roy was replaced by Vos. And Vos was pushed out by a coup of sorts when a group of employees, led by a trio of managers hired in the earlier era, went to the leader of X, Astro Teller, and made their case against Vos. (Vos did not return our request for comment.) The initial design of Project Wing, a fixed wing aircraft that took off and landed like a helicopter, had proven to be a bust, and other internal problems plagued the team even as it shifted to a new drone design. Teller sided with the faction of protesters and Vos was out. Each of the three men were then put in charge of crucial elements of the newly designed drone and Teller himself took over as the project's leader, we understand. Everyone is watching Project Wing is being watched at the highest levels of Google. X is Google cofounder Sergey Brin's baby and he keeps tabs on many of the projects. We understand that he keeps a desk at Project Wing and talks with the team regularly. Larry Page, the co-founder of Google who is now CEO of its parent company Alphabet, also called out Wing in his annual letter to shareholders just published on Thursday. "Sergey is continuing to spend time working with the X moonshot factory. They have a number of efforts like Wing, which is doing drone delivery. I also can't wait for them to launch!" he wrote. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Google Project Wing However, the person we talked tells us that the drone still needs a lot of work as is not on the verge of becoming its own company and product. This person didn't estimate when that would happen. Despite the politics, Alphabet remains committed to the project and says there's exciting news to be shared soon. "Project Wing is moving ahead at full speed and we're enthusiastic about the team's progress in developing the next phase of our technology. We're wholeheartedly committed to the moonshot of opening the skies to faster, more efficient transportation of goods, and we look forward to having updates to share in the coming weeks," the spokesperson told us.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root gizmodo How to Abandon Android and Switch to iOS David NieldYesterday 1:02pm Filed to: Android iOS mobile 101 5 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Gizmodo Maybe you like the curves of the iPhone 7, maybe you just don’t trust Google with your data any more, or maybe someone just gave you an iPhone as a birthday present. Whatever the reason, here’s how to get your entire digital life from Android to iOS with as little head-scratching as possible. Advertisement For simplicity’s sake, we’ll assume you’re set up on Android with your data plugged into Google’s services (Gmail, Google Calendar and so on). If you’re using something else, like a Microsoft or Yahoo email address, the process will be similar, and often just involves installing the relevant Android-analogous app on your new iPhone. We should also point out that a future Field Guide will talk about moving in the opposite direction, so watch this space for that. Apple’s Move to iOS app Move to iOS has its merits... if you can get it to work. (Image: Screenshot) You can automate much of what we’re about to talk about with Apple’s official Move to iOS app for Android: it handles email, calendars, contacts, photos, videos (taken with the device), and even text message history. Advertisement There are a couple of caveats to consider. One, you need to be setting up your iPhone from scratch, so it needs to be brand new or freshly reset, and two, it doesn’t give you all that much control over the way everything gets switched. It also misses out some of the files and data we’re going to cover below, and as you’ll note in reviews of the app, it can be hit and miss on actually transferring texts. Moving texts SMS Backup+ can send your texts to Gmail. (Image: Screenshot) Moving SMSes is tricky—Move to iOS is in theory one of the cleanest options, as we’ve mentioned, but you need to be setting your iPhone up from scratch, and users report mixed results in transferring SMS history right into iOS Messages. We tried several times to get the app to work on our devices and had to give up as it refused to make a wireless connection, but your mileage may vary. Backing up an archive of your Android texts isn’t too difficult: SMS Backup+ will send them all to Gmail for you, and SMS Backup & Restore can back them up to Google Drive or Dropbox too. A variety of third-party Windows and macOS apps promise to do the job for you as well, but we’d be wary of installing anything unofficial unless it’s been around for a long time, is regular updated, and has a long list of positive user reviews. We can’t vouch for the security or reliability of any of them, except for SMS Backup+, which we’ve been using without any problems for years, and SMS Backup & Restore, which comes from a very reputable software developer. Advertisement Sponsored Unless you can get Move to iOS to work better than we did, replicating an exact copy of your Android SMS history in Messages looks almost impossible—at best you can get some kind of archive exported for future reference. It’s a different story with other instant messaging apps, which we’ll come on to later. Moving emails If you want to keep your Google accounts active, they integrate neatly with iOS. (Image: Screenshot) If you want to take your Gmail account with you over to iOS, you’ve got two options: install the Gmail app for Apple devices, or add your Gmail account to the default Mail app on iOS. The first one is easier but the second helps you cut ties with Google more quickly. First, you need to prepare your Gmail account for the great export. Open the Settings tab on the web (click the cog icon then Settings), switch to the Forwarding and POP/IMAP section, and enable either POP for all emails or IMAP. Are you going to carry on using your Gmail account? Then use IMAP, which gives you two-way access to your Gmail inbox from Apple’s Mail app. Do you just want to download your old Google messages and never look back? Go for POP, which will download all your emails. With that done, open up Settings in iOS, choose Mail, then tap Accounts and Add Account. Choose Google if you’re taking the IMAP approach, then follow the instructions on screen to sign into your Gmail; choose Other if you’re using POP, in which case you’ll need these details to configure access. Moving contacts and calendars  iCloud can accept contacts but not calendars. (Image: Screenshot) You can move your Google (Android) contacts and calendars over to iOS very easily: open Settings on your iPhone, tap Contacts (or Calendar), then choose Accounts. Choose Add Account and Google, or pick the existing Google entry from the list, then log in with your Google credentials to get everything synced over. Advertisement Advertisement That then keeps your Google Contacts and Google Calendars in sync with the native Contacts and Calendar apps on iOS (and macOS)—but perhaps that’s not what you want. If you’d rather forget the syncing aspect and just move your Google data over in a one-time operation, it’s a bit more involved and needs a manual export and import: it’s messier, but it does mean you can get everything natively inside Apple’s apps and leave Google behind. First you export your Google contacts to a .vcf file from the Contacts app on Android (in Settings on the app menu) or via Google Contacts on the web. Select all your contacts then pick More to find the Export link. That .vcf file can then be imported through iCloud on the web or emailed to your iPhone—once you tap on the attachment, you’ll be asked if you want to import the contacts. It’s a similar process with Google Calendar. Here you need to visit the web interface, then export your schedules by clicking the cog icon, Settings, Calendars and Export Calendars. The files you’ve created can’t be imported into iCloud though—you need to add them in the Calendar app in macOS to sync them to an iPhone via iCloud. If you don’t have a macOS machine on hand, you’re pretty much stuck with entering your birthdays and appointments all over again, unless you’re happy with just using Google Calendar for iOS or trying Move to iOS for Android with the caveats we mentioned earlier. Moving photos and videos Google Photos is the most obvious option for photos and videos. (Image: Screenshot) This can be incredibly straightforward or rather messy depending on how you want to do it and where your photos and videos are stored. Assuming you’re taking advantage of Google Photos, the native photo manager for (stock) Android, you can simply install the iOS version to get at your whole library pictures and movies (and to upload anything you take on your new iPhone). Advertisement You go to Settings then Back up & sync and Back up device folders to make sure you’ve got absolutely everything copied off your phone and up to the cloud. Even if you’re abandoning Google services completely, this option will show you all the different folders on your Android device where pictures are stored. If you want to get everything moved, pixel-by-pixel, from Google Photos to Apple’s iCloud Photo Library, more effort is required: we’ve actually done a complete guide to this in the past. Refer to that article for full details, but in summary you need to use Google Drive or Google Takeout to get hard copies of your photos and videos downloaded to a macOS or Windows machine. From there you can import them into Photos for macOS, iTunes on Windows, or iCloud on the web, and from there over to an iPhone. Advertisement If you don’t use Google Photos, you need some other method for getting all your Android photos and videos to a computer, and from there to Apple Photos and iCloud. Dropbox will do it, for example, or you can use the tried and trusted USB cable method. Just be sure that you’ve harvested all the files from all your apps—apps like Twitter and WhatsApp save photos in a different location to the main gallery, for example. Moving music and movies Importing files to iTunes is one way to get them on iOS. Image: Screenshot Android being Android, you might have your music and movies on your phone in all kinds of ways: Netflix, Plex, Google Play Movies & TV, and so on. Just about any video or music app you have installed on Android will be on iOS as well, including those we just mentioned—a lot of the time there are no files to transfer, just logins to manage. Advertisement Any local files you’ve got queued up on Android should work just fine on iOS too. You don’t have to use Apple’s own music and video apps if you don’t want, but if you do then you need to get your local files off your Android device and into iTunes with the help of a macOS or Windows machine. Presumably a lot of the files on your Android device were synced from a computer in the first place, but if not they can be transferred via USB or an app like Dropbox, as with your personal photos and videos. Then from iTunes, choose File and Add to Library (macOS) or Add File to Library (Windows) to import the media. If you run into file format problems we’d recommend using Handbrake to solve them. If you’re heavily invested in purchases from Google Play Movies & TV, there is an iOS version. Image: Screenshot iOS is more restrictive when it comes to syncing music and movies to your phone, and if you don’t want to go through iTunes, you need to use an app that can pull files straight from the cloud or over a Wi-Fi network rather than relying on local storage: the likes of Plex, Spotify and VLC will all do the job. Advertisement If you aren’t cutting the Google cord completely, Google Drive is another good option for watching video on iOS without having to actually transfer any files, because you can stream files straight from the cloud. It’s when you’re switching between mobile OSes that these device-agnostic apps and platforms really come into their own. In short, you’ve got plenty of choices for apps that will play your local, unrestricted, DRM-free music and movie files on iOS, while any digital library app you’ve been using on Android will have an equivalent on iOS, so there’s no real problem there either. Moving apps and games You can’t easily transfer WhatsApp chats, though you can email them to yourself. (Image: Screenshot) There’s no way around the fact that you need to get all your Android apps installed again on iOS, and pay twice in some cases. Though subscription services like Netflix and Spotify just switch straight over (moving between devices is another good reason to live your digital life in the cloud). Advertisement Advertisement Most social media and messaging apps will take everything from Android to iOS for you, though there are exceptions, with WhatsApp being one of the big ones. Unfortunately, WhatsApp’s own backup and restore function only works when you’re going from Android-to-Android or iPhone-to-iPhone. As with text messages, various third-party options are available, but we can’t vouch for any in particular. If you’re happy just having a record of your WhatsApp chats and are ready to start afresh on iPhone, you can email them to yourself. From the WhatsApp Settings screen, tap Chats, then Chat history, and Email chat: you can then pick your conversations one by one and email yourself a copy, with or without attached media. Boom Beach is one game where you can link devices. (Image: Screenshot) We can’t go through every messaging app in detail here but obviously your switch is going to be easier with those apps that store everything in the cloud (hello Google Hangouts). Virtually every instant messenger on Android has an iOS equivalent so it’s a question of exploring the import and export options—you may just have to start again with a blank message history on iOS. Advertisement Another area where you might have trouble is with your saved games and high scores: not only will you need to pay for all your games again, you’re probably going to lose your progress too. Some apps, like Subway Surfers (with Facebook) and Boom Beach (with a code), will let you transfer progress and scores between devices, but again you’ll have to do the research every game you own to be sure. If you can’t find the answers you’re looking for out on the web then contact the developer directly and see if there’s any way for getting your saved games from one platform to the other. The same goes for other types of app if you can’t see an obvious way of moving data between Android and iOS installs. Moving yet more files and data Use a file explorer to look for data you’ve missed. Image: Screenshot We’re not quite done yet! You might want to be as comprehensive as possible in your data switchover—think about any documents or spreadsheets you’ve got stored on your Android device. Most productivity apps will store these in the cloud, so getting at them from iOS should be simple, but it’s wise to double-check. Advertisement Advertisement The vast majority of Android apps can be found on iOS, with the only exceptions being advanced customization tools such as Tasker or the Android launchers, which you’re just going to have to live without in iPhone-land. Other apps should have iPhone equivalents and some kind of mechanism for switching files over—if you’re worried about something getting left behind, use a file manager like Solid Explorer for a deeper look. One of the folders to check is the Downloads folder, which brings us to our final section. Web Browsing If you’ve got Chrome on Android syncing everything like passwords and bookmarks back to the cloud, you can simply install Chrome on iOS and get on with your life, but if you’re determined to use Safari on your new iPhone then you need to jump through a few more hoops. Chrome for iOS will take all your passwords and browsing history with you. Image: Screenshot The aforementioned Move to iOS is one option for your web bookmarks, or you can set up synced versions of Chrome and Safari on macOS and use the respective export and import tools to get everything moved over (and from there to your iPhone). Advertisement If neither of those options appeal, you’re going to have to start from scratch, and the same goes for stored passwords and browsing history (you can at least access your saved Chrome passwords from this page on the web to ease the process of switching over). These elements are just too deeply integrated into Chrome to get them easily over to Safari, so embrace the chance to start afresh. It may not be possible, but ideally you want to keep your Android and iOS devices running alongside each other for a while: it makes it easier to check up on gaps in your transferred data, like browsing history, and helps you spot anything you might have missed (such as a PDF file that’s fallen through the cracks).

Last summer Google revealed personalized data dashboards for every Google account, letting users edit (or delete) items from their search history as well as their viewing history on YouTube. Now Slashdot reader Lauren Weinstein writes: Since posting "The Google Page That Google Haters Don't Want You to Know About" last week, I've received a bunch of messages from readers asking for help using Google's "My Activity" page to control, inspect, and/or delete their data on Google. The My Activity portal is quite comprehensive and can be used in many different ways, but to get you started I'll briefly outline how to use My Activity to delete activity data. CNET points out you can also access the slightly-creepier "Google Maps location history" by clicking the menu icon in the upper left corner and selecting "Other Google activity." But Weinstein writes, "I have no problems with Google collecting the kinds of data that provide their advanced services, so long as I can choose when that data is collected, and I can inspect and delete it on demand.

Following similar investigations into Google and Apple Inc, tax police reportedly handed Milan prosecutors a dossier on their investigations on 2009 to 2014 returns by the world’s largest online retailer. In a statement, Amazon denied the claim, adding that it had invested about 800 million euros over the past seven years in the nation, where it employs about 2,000 people, and had reduced profits there to ramp down its tax exposure. AUTOMAKERS US probes GM recall The US government is investigating whether General Motors Co should add about 312,000 vehicles to a 2015 recall for headlights that can suddenly go dark. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday said that 128 owners have complained that low-beam lights can fail. The investigation covers the 2005 and 2009 Buick Lacrosse; the 2006 and 2007 Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy and Buick Rainier; the 2006-2008 Isuzu Ascender and Saab 9-7X; and the 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix. At the time of the recall GM said the headlamp module in the engine compartment could overheat and stop working properly. INTERNET Google CEO paid US$200m Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai last year received a US$200 million compensation package for running the Internet company that makes nearly all the money for Alphabet Inc. Most of the pay consisted of Alphabet stock that the company valued at US$198.7 million in securities documents filed on Friday. Alphabet gave the award to Pichai in January last year, a few months after he succeeded Larry Page as Google’s chief executive officer. The 44-year-old Pichai last year also received a US$650,000 salary in addition to personal security services and air travel valued at US$372,000. TECHNOLOGY IBM pay plan challenged IBM’s compensation plan for top executives drew record shareholder opposition after the board last year boosted chief executive officer Ginni Rometty’s pay package more than 60 percent. About 46 percent of the votes cast at Tuesday’s annual meeting in Tampa, Florida, went against the board’s pay plan for top bosses, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. That is IBM’s lowest result since votes were first mandated for public companies in 2011. While it is not binding, 30 percent opposition is generally considered the threshold for a losing vote and a result that should prompt directors to address shareholder concerns. The board “will review the results of this vote, as is its customary practice,” IBM said in an e-mailed statement. UTILITIES Swiss court rejects appeal A Swiss court has rejected an appeal by Egyptian energy companies after a French court last year ordered them to pay US$2 billion in compensation to state-owned Israel Electric Corp (IEC), the Israeli utility said. An IEC statement on Friday said that Egyptian Natural Gas and Egyptian General Petroleum Corp were liable because they were unable to fulfil their commitment to provide it with natural gas for its power stations. Egypt sold gas to Israel under a 20-year agreement that collapsed in 2012 after months of repeated attacks by insurgents on a pipeline serving Israel in Egypt’s remote Sinai Peninsula.

Designed primarily for software developers, the HiKey 960 is a single-board computer that runs on Google’s Android operating system. It has been designed as a high-end solution for building and testing ARM applications. Currently, Android developers wishing to design products for ARM chips have to programme them on the rival Intel x86 architectures. Read More 'Robot Wars' came to Cambridge this weekend Based on Huawei’s octa-core Kirin 960 chip, the HiKey 960 features four high-intensity ARM Cortex-A73 cores and four low-power Cortex-A53 cores, meaning it packs a lot of bunch. The computer has been developed in partnership with Linaro, the Harston-based open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the ARM ecosystem. Its CEO George Grey said developers who want to work closer to the ARM hardware will gain maximum advantage from the computer. These could include mobile developers looking to enable support and innovative functionality with new and existing sensors, security and other peripheral hardware and software, and developers working on derivative products for markets like digital signage, point of sale (POS) and robotics. Read More Happy birthday Raspberry Pi: Cambridge's computing sensation turns five “We are very pleased to be working with Linaro members ARM, Huawei, Google, Archermind and LeMaker on this product”, said Grey. “The HiKey 960 delivers on the goal of 96Boards to provide access to the latest ARM technology to the developer community, with support for the latest Huawei mobile system on chip featuring high performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores coupled with the latest generation of ARM Mali GPU technology.” Though primarily running Android, the HiKey 960 supports Linux, meaning it can be used for maker products such as drones or other smart devices. However, it doesn’t share a price tag with the ultra low-cost Raspberry Pi, instead retailing at $289, or about £184. With that in mind, one suspects it will be more popular with serious software developers than the digital making community. “ARM is committed to providing platform developers with access to new technologies in an effort to support ongoing innovation on ARM-based mobile platforms,” said Laurence Bryant, vice president of personal mobile compute, at the Fulbourn chip design giant. “The HiKey 960 platform integrates the latest big.LITTLE technology that combines the Cortex-A73, the most powerful yet power efficient mobile CPU, the Cortex-A53 for further efficiency and the latest Mali GPU, Mali-G71. “We’re enabling a range of advanced solutions to be brought to market more quickly.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @CambridgeNewsUK Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On Google Business all Most Read Most Recent Harry PotterIf you're a Harry Potter fan we've found the perfect job for you...

Levandowski disclosed the change on Thursday in an internal memo that was obtained by Business Insider, adding that he will no longer attend meetings or make decisions about lidar efforts while legal proceedings continue. “We should all be proud that our self-driving technology has been built independently, from the ground up,” Levandowski said in his email, which was addressed to his Uber employees. “With this move, I hope to keep the team focused on achieving the vision that brought us all here.” Uber confirmed the email and declined to comment further. Intellectual property The move punctuates an increasingly nasty legal battle between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving-vehicle company that was spun off from Google’s parent company. In February, Waymo sued Uber, alleging that the ride-hailing company was using intellectual property, including downloaded documents, stolen by Levandowski when he was an executive at Google. Waymo is asking a federal court to issue an injunction that would halt Uber’s work on self-driving cars, which the judge in the case is expected to decide on next week. If the decision goes in Waymo’s favour, it could seriously impede Uber’s progress in autonomous vehicle research. Levandowski’s shift in role appears designed to shield Uber from any perception of impropriety during the litigation. But legal scholars question whether the change will be effective. “Assuming a successful suit, Waymo could get damages for the period AL was involved,” Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said in an email, referring to Levandowski. “If the purloined documents are still accessible to, and can be implemented by, the rest of the team, his recusal makes no difference.” With the change in role, Eric Meyhofer, a principal at Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group in Pittsburgh, will lead the driverless car division and report directly to Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Levandowski, who had reported to Kalanick, will report to Meyhofer. Levandowski remains in charge of handling testing and operations of Uber’s self-driving vehicle group in cities. Proprietary research information At the heart of Waymo’s case is the technology involved in Uber’s lidar. Levandowski, a pioneer in the field of self-driving research, worked for Google’s autonomous vehicle wing for nearly a decade, but left to form his own start-up, Otto, at the beginning of 2016. He sold that start-up to Uber in August for $680 million. Waymo alleged that before Levandowski left Google, he copied and took with him terabytes’ worth of proprietary research information on Google’s lidar hardware. Levandowski has denied the assertions, and Uber has similarly denied that it is using driverless car technology stolen from Google. At stake is what many technologists consider to be the intersection of the next wave of computing, artificial intelligence and an entirely new category of transportation. Kalanick has said the race for self-driving technology is “existential” to Uber’s future, looking ahead to a day when smart driverless vehicles can move millions of people around as quickly and efficiently as possible. That race has been heating up. Waymo said this week it plans to test driverless vehicles with the public in Arizona, part of a partnership with Fiat Chrysler. General Motors purchased Cruise Automation, an autonomous-vehicle technology start-up, in 2016 for $1 billion in cash and stock, and is working with the Uber rival Lyft on its ambitions for an autonomous-vehicle network. Other players include Tesla, which offers a version of self-driving technology. Apple, too, is working on a project on self-driving cars, which has changed in tenor and scope as the company has run into some hurdles internally during the past year. This month, Apple obtained a permit to test self-driving vehicles in California.

The individual, Lithuanian national Evaldas Rimasauskas, was charged last month by the US Department of Justice for fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering. According to Fortune, Rimasauskas began forging email addresses, corporate stamps, and invoices so he could impersonate a Taiwanese manufacturer of tech supplies, and swindle departments at Facebook and Google out of funds which encompassed a total of more than $100M between 2013 and 2015. Rimasauskas deposited the money in banks worldwide, in countries such as Latvia, Cyprus, Hong Kong, Slovenia, Hungary, and Lithuania. Court documents for Rimasauskas' indictment, which were unsealed by the Department of Justice last month, did not directly name Facebook and Google as being victims of the scam, referring instead to a "multinational technology company, specializing in internet-related services and products," and a "multinational corporation providing online social media and networking services”. Facebook and Google have since confirmed to Fortune that they were the companies that had been targeted by the scheme. At a time when consumers are being swindled by websites promising Nintendo Switch Emulators, it is interesting to note that even large companies such as Facebook and Google are not immune to such scams .

Joomla Social View Comments Google CEO Sundar Pichai received nearly $199.7 million in compensation last year, double the amount he made in 2015, according to a filing Friday from Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30). Pichai's base pay was a mere $650,000. On top of that, he received a stock award for $198.7 million. The company's compensation committee attributed the lavish pay to Pichai's promotion to CEO and "numerous successful product launches." Pichai, a longtime Google executive, took over as CEO as part of a corporate restructuring in 2015. Larry Page, Google's cofounder and previous CEO, shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella. Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing. In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice controlled smart speaker similar to the Amazon Echo. These efforts have started to pay off for the company. Google's "other revenues," a category that includes hardware and cloud services, hit nearly $3.1 billion in the most recent quarter, a gain of about 50% from the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet's stock has soared this year, pushing it above a $600 billion market cap this week for the first time. -CNN View the discussion thread. blog comments powered by DISQUS back to top < Prev Next > Side1 As We Celebrate Labour Day, Here Are Some Of The Fastest Growing Jobs In The 21st Century Housing For Construction Workers: Many Prefer To Rent Their Own Place Ali Rustam Calls On BN To Wrest Back Bukit Katil In GE14 Pas' Move To Sever Ties With PKR, End Talks With PPBM Too Hasty: Mahfuz Azmin's Chided Once Again Over 'Pak Lebai' Jibe Against Pas Hiburan sidebar "Ada Yang Tak Suka Saya Dengan Alif" - Nabila Razali Didakwa Langgar Kontrak: Azrel, Risteena Disaman RM1.5 juta Bill Cosby Dedah Dirinya Sudah Buta Lirik Lagu Twice "TT" Masuk Dalam Soalan Peperiksaan Penulis Novel 7 Hari Mencintaimu Tuntut RM10juta Malaysian Digest Copyright © 2010 - 2017 | malaysiandigest.com .

Google disables location sharing in Google+ before enabling it for everyone in Google Maps Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/03/28 1:14am PDTMar 28, 2017 241 Plus 1 on G+ 176 Share on Facebook 95 Share on Twitter Total Shares512 Applications Google News Last week, Google announced new location sharing features in Google Maps that would allow you to easily share your current position momentarily or indefinitely with select people. The option is the same that we've had in Google+ for a few years, except it would now be in the app that made most sense, Maps. It also follows Google's trend of decoupling options and features from Google+. In the official announcement, Google said the feature would be rolling out "soon" worldwide, but didn't give an exact timeline, and we have yet to see it on our devices regardless of the version of Maps we're running. However, Google has gone ahead and disabled it in Google+ for many users, making it momentarily impossible for them to share their location in either app. What these users are seeing when they head to the Locations tab in Google+ is a message telling them to move to Google Maps. If they tap the button to switch to Maps, they get redirected to a help page that offers updating Google Maps because the new feature is not yet live in their current version. And if they finally tap to update Google Maps, they're redirected to the Play Store with no update in sight for Maps.   Go to Google Maps. Update Google Maps. And there's no update for Google Maps. Huh?! It looks like a case of eager fingers pulling the plug too soon on the feature from Google+ without making sure it's already live in Maps. Or, better yet, miscommunication between the teams and lack of clear timeline planning to make sure all users have the alternative live for them before killing the previous option. Couples, parents and children, friends, and teams who relied on this feature to follow each other's progress are left without a functional location sharing. In the interim, I suggest maybe you give Trusted Contacts a try to at least have the option to request someone's location if you're worried about them. It's not the same as live sharing, but it should cover the most crucial situations while Google sorts this mess out and releases an update to Maps.

Dennis Ulijn More like "Google Attitude" UniBroW Everything that is old is new again HSidhu Old is Gold Soundjudgment ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Or in the Google Universe: "Everything New... is Old." Justin It's not the same, some people just too dumb to realize including the OP. This is real-time location sharing get it? Google Latitude and Google+ both only update our location periodically. Did you even watch the video? Jay Latitude did have real time location sharing. You could use real time location for up to a certain time limit. They put a time limit so you wouldn't drain the other person's​ battery. After the time limit, you could just keep requesting real time updates though. Justin No, Google Latitude does not have real-time location sharing, it was the same like Google+ which updates you the current location only if you open the app, it updates the location periodically. https://youtu.be/Q-Oq-9enE-k Jay Yes it did. I am 100% sure it did. I used to use it all the time. Before Latitude was folded into Google+ Latitude had real time location sharing, but was removed because it used up too much battery. There are entire forums dedicated to asking what happened to Latitude real time location sharing. Justin Nope, i was a Google Latitude user too, it was not real-time. Also it didn't even mention a single word "real-time" in Google Latitude Wikipedia page. Jay Google maps 4.6 https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/28/latitude-real-time/ As I said. It existed, it was awesome and it was removed due to poor battery life. Justin Ok, you're half right, it was in Google Maps v4.6 instead of Google Latitude and it was experimental, guess i wasn't that lucky enough to experience it. Was it only available for a short time before they removed it? Jay Google Latitude was the sharing portion of Google maps. They were never 2 separate apps. I was not half right, I was completely right. They removed it because you could track someone real time and the person being tracked would have their battery killed in a couple hours from nonstop GPS use. After a month they put a time limit and within the year they shut it down, then a few months later it got rolled into google+. Justin Ok mate, but why the real-time location sharing was stripped off when it got integrated into Google+? It's was such a powerful feature. demarcmj They were technically two separate apps. Kinda like how Google Street View is it's own app even though it is essentially an extension for the Maps app. But they were tightly integrated. makapav In fact, Latittude was a very smart implementation of Google Maps. It could show a parallel instance of the Maps app layer - with the bubbles even while you were navigating in the 'main app instance'. I doubt they were smart enough to do the same thing this time because there is not 'second' Latitude/Locations launch icon yet. shubjero I remember real time sharing with Google Latitude. Jay is spot on here. makapav Yes. You are correct. In Latitude you had the option to 'request immediate location update' for a particular bubble provided the remote phone supported it. It was added in subsequent updates. Lars Jeppesen Yep, used it too. U are right Aaron Berlin In my experience, people found the combination of "always on" location with an actual dot on a map a little invasive. Somebody would describe a problem to me, Latitude would be the obvious solution, but the response I'd get was almost always "that's pretty creepy". Maybe it's me! Justin Well, you can always opt not to share it. demarcmj I think you're making assumptions based on only very little information Google has actually provided on this. With Latitude (and G+) it always shared your most recent location. If the person on the other hand had the maps app open, then their location was updating constantly on their phone, and you saw it on your phone updating in more-or-less real time. If they didn't have the maps app open, the regular background polling rate resumed, and you only got updates whenever their phone decided to check in. Aside from the addition of the "navigation sharing" there's no reason to think this won't work exactly the same way that Latitude always did. This "real time" text is probably overblown marketing. I find it really hard to believe that if you turn on sharing, your GPS poll rate is going to be pegged to the maximum 100% of the time. Your battery would die in 2 hours. Google makes some questionable decisions, but they're not that stupid. Justin Well, Jay just explained that Google Latitude was available in real-time location sharing just for a year before Google pull the plug so I didn't get the chance to experience it, late adopter i guess. No, Google+ was not real-time even if you open the Google+ location page and you drive around, i tested this myself and it was periodically. demarcmj The sharing was always your most recent location. So if the person had maps open, their location is constantly updating and therefore the sharing was more-or-less real time. I did that all the time... opening up navigation even when I knew where I was going, just so my wife could see me moving (and vice versa). I literally did this a week ago. It works. Granted, the app itself didn't update as fast, if you were just staring at it, but if you refreshed the persons location, you'd get a fresh position every time Justin No mate, i tested it too, the GPS dot does not move in real-time in the Google+ location page, unlike the Google Maps GPS dot always moves in real-time with or without turn-by-turn navigation turned on. But once you restart Google+ the location only will be updated. I agree with you on "more or less" the same as real-time but definitely not 100% real-time in every single second. demarcmj Well I used it all the time. Like I said, you did have to refresh the location manually when you wanted to check (although you shouldn't have needed to restart the G+ app entirely). Justin Yes not necessary need to restart the app, just hit the refresh button will do. But did you notice that when you're hitting the refresh button constantly, it doesn't update immediately, same goes to restarting the app, it has a cool down duration and i guess it has something to do with Location History because Google+ location sharing only can operate if you turned on Location History. Nathaniel Yang I have tracked my partner on G+ before and its pretty close to real time. They tell you the last known location of the person and even tell you when they were last here. In my case its usually a minute ago or less. Ryan Who cares, youre bitching about semanitcs. It was as realistic as real-time location sharing got then and it was where it should have been, built into a mapping software. It just updated in a reasonable span and you could ping for a more recent update, but you didnt need input from the share-er. If you really want to be a pedantic ass then you could argue that THIS isnt going to be real-time either, because really doing that doesnt scale. Justin Oh look a bitch who cared enough to leave a comment. Ryan Who cares was about your shitty logic in an attempt to tell yourself youre right about something you were universally wrong about. But as I scrolled down I saw all of your responses to everyone clawing at any way to be right . It was too pathetic to continue pointing out so Ill let you have at it. Now as for the topic at hand, I do care about it. Justin Google Maps location sharing is going to be real-time whether you like it or not bitch. Ryan It would be hilarious of the trademark expired on it and someone else got it from them. I was so pissed when they broke Google Latitude and moved it to + because they never took the feature over to Apple. So it broke location sharing for the family since my parents had Iphones. It should, at this point, be something they supported universally. It really helped when the parents had a breakdown while we were all in a foreign city, we could find them easily. Nicholas Well, that was the one think I was using Google + for these days. DELETED Duncankrebbers Same here! I wonder how long it will take before Google Apps users will get this feature in maps. Especially since "saved lists" still aren't available for us either. Peter Been wondering the same thing. Also, the 'places with upcoming events' doesn't work eithet yet. Duncankrebbers I'm seriously considering switching to an @gmail.com account on my phone, just to have access to features like these and Google Music Family etc. Just wished there was an easy way to do this. Peter I am slowly migrating over myself. I have my old g apps and a gmail account on my pixel. There is a 4 month free for play music promo at the mo too. Duncankrebbers Sounds like a good incentive to make the switch, thanks! Gerardo Sarabia I did that a couple years ago because support sucks for business accounts, do it, it's way better. You'll never get rid of your old account, tho, unless you purchase everything in the Google Play Store again, or transfer all your data from Drive or Google Photos, or videos on YouTube, or change your email on every single service you subscribed before... very annoying. Google should allow profiles to be linked to multiple emails. It just makes sense. James Bray I did this a year ago, and while it was a total pain in the ass for a couple of weeks, it's okay now. I then set up mail forwarding with my domain registrar to forward e-mails to my GApps address to my gmail one. Ryan Ugh, I didnt think about that. I hope they dont drag their feet to get this up and working again. There are a few things good about apps but Googles implementation of anything even remotely tied to "security" is hot garbage. And youre supposed to pay for that hot garbage! Ryan So I just got it on my apps/G Suite account, so at least in this instance we arent left behind. Paulo Apps for Business user here. I got it yesterday. Total Insecurity Not long if you press some magic buttons :D "Edit: I just tried the same on my other device. There it could get activated by signing out and in again.

I'm so glad to have that shit off my phone. Ryan Same here. cocolopecita You still need Google+ if you want to post comments on the Play Store or YouTube.

James Bray What's strange, is that there is a widget available from Google Maps for "Friends Location" and one for "Share Location" but trying to add these to the home screen gives "Get Started" page and then just dumps you into the app. Looks like the app is up to date, but the server needs a switch flipped. I'm on the Google Maps Beta app. Imre I agree - this is very likely BomberLT Same here. I wonder how many people have this server side switch already on. Total Insecurity I have it in Germany. I had to do press some magic buttons and then I instantly got the server side update 😎🤓 Amir Arsyad It is live for me https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8dc4777ce2271b8b70b8b9448e466d94a21c24df6616a1307b55aa342bd974cb.png demarcmj It's starting to show up for a few people now. I think they started the rollout at the same time they killed the feature in G+. Artem Russakovskii Which is just so blatantly idiotic. demarcmj https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/47636d452e9cdd20b07a2a23a2e039381471a7aebca8a6bf49b7bd5bbde0086d.png makapav PS. Did they screw up all existing shares from Google+ Locations like they did with Latitude > Google+? demarcmj I don't have it yet, but there is a 100% chance that that is the case. makapav You should now be able to add others that should force activate it on their IDs like most other Google rollouts. BFRC My G+ Locations is not disabled, but there are no people left that share their locations with me, strangely enough. I need to say though: if you migrate a service, which sensible company would allow for downtime in the first place? It feels weird that Maps lacks the feature. Peter Reboot your device, and G+ locations will disappear. Although the empty widget still exists. SSyar clearing G+ data does that for me Justin Just restart the app itself will do. No need to reboot device. Justin Just restart the app itself will do. Ryan They broke the location sharing before killing it with an app update. Mine was broken for a few days prior. furioustoaster Mine was working up until it disappeared today Martin Korbel Location sharing in maps is live for me... Peter What version of maps are you running and what country are you in? Martin Korbel 9.49.2, Czech Republic Peter Thanks, i live in hope it is a quick global rollout. Rita El Khoury It's only live for a small subset of users, but not everyone. Hence why it's weird that it was disabled in Google+ before reaching complete rollout in Maps. ChicagoPete It's live for me this morning in the US. I'm pretty sure it wasn't there before, at least when the original story came out last week. Ryan They actually broke it about 48 hours ago anyway. While G+ behaved normally everyone I had sharing turned on with disappeared from my location sharing lists. Total Insecurity I think this could be of interest to you and everyone else who likes this be feature: "Edit: I just tried the same on my other device.

Roy Santos I'm sure that years ago this used to be in Google Maps, before they made it less functional by moving it to the (then brand new) Google+. At least it's finally going back to where it should be, even if they are messing up the transition. John Monks FFS Google, my wife and I use this all the time. It's particularly useful for checking if the other is driving before making a distracting (and illegal if they answer) phone call. Thank you Rita for the Trusted contacts suggestion but it doesn't really fit our needs. Just have to hope they don't take forever to replace it. Darius_bd Glympse? https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glympse.android.glympse John Monks Thanks, I've added it to my wishlist for consideration if the gmaps share doesn't show up soon (or it doesn't work well when it does). dxdydz I've been using Glympse for a couple years now. One thing I like about it is that if the other person doesn't have the Glympse app it just send them a link that opens a web app with the real-time location data. This link feature works great for people who don't have the app. Which is just about everybody. Google Maps' location integration is nice because most people have Google Maps, except the people who use Apple Maps (I'm in the US). I haven't heard anything about the new location integration in Google Maps having any sort of share function similar to Glympse, which is kind of a bummer. I could see it being beneficial. ALSO what's neat about Glympse is you can open the link on your computer too. Abhilash Bingi If they don't have a Google Account: People with this link can see your location for as long as you choose, up to 72 hours. From: https://support.google.com/plus/answer/3302509?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1 dxdydz Great news! Sorry Glympse... Total Insecurity You can also share the link to anyone in Google Maps' live location sharing ;D Lars Jeppesen Yeah same here.. this is pretty stupid, Google.. I'm jumping to Glympse for the time being.. Total Insecurity I make it shorter for you: Edit: I just tried the same on my other device. There it could get activated by signing out and in again.

I hope it works for you as well! ﻿ Virtud When they deleted Google Latitude years ago, I started using Life360 for my family. Try that if only temporary until they enable this new sharing feature in Maps. catalysto Not to sound like an ass or anything, but why don't you just trust each other not to answer while you're driving? Seems like a waste of time to have that extra step every time you want to call. Also, depending on where you are, handsfree while driving is a (totally legal) option. John Monks I do trust her not to answer the phone, but rather than call, and then assume a lack of an answer means she's driving and hope she remembers to return the missed call when she arrives, I can just wait until she gets there and call her then. Its not the only use case we have for it, just one example I gave. And yes, hands free calling is legal in some places, but it's not where I am, so that's not really relevant. John Monks So apparently impotently shaking my fist in the general direction of Mountain View worked, and the feature is now active in maps for me, good luck to those still waiting Total Insecurity Bro. To make it faster read this. It should enable the new (old) feature in an instant: "Edit: I just tried the same on my other device. There it could get activated by signing out and in again.

Cristian Sebeni-Grec I have the new Share Location working on Google Maps v9.49.2 Andy Kennedy I have this version in UK too but not live for me. Google really are messing things up for its users in many things this year and it isn't looking great for them. I'm finding it so hard to keep reccommending their products to people when they pull poop like this! SteveO Location sharing in maps is live for me as well (Germany). Rita El Khoury But it's not live for all users, hence the "for everyone" in the title. Those who don't have it yet have no option in the meantime. JG Just to clarify... When we talk of the location sharing inside G+ that's been removed... I'm assuming/hoping we're referring to a feature that I apparently didn't know existed, that would be similar to what will be available via the Maps app... And not the Facebook like ability to tag your posts with your current location.... I don't tag many of my (unfortunately infrequent) posts, but I have found it to be useful from time to time... And in checking G+ I see I still have the ability to tag my posts, so either Google brought it back or hasn't taken it from me yet, or I was right and it's some other service... Gerardo Sarabia Same feature exactly as the one Google Maps is getting. It was on maps, then they moved it to G+, and now it's making a comeback. Nathan J Maps would be the logical place for location sharing, but the third-party app Glympse has been doing such a great job at this for so long, it's only a trivial fact that Google offers a similar service, first in Google+, and soon in Google Maps. Google's Maps implementation might even make more sense than Glympse, which would be the redundant app, as opposed to Maps, but with Google's habit of dismantling services for no good reason would leave those of us who have been around the block a few times just sticking with Glympse, lacking a reason to change from it. I don't have the option to share my location in Google Maps. Apple Maps has the option to mark my location, and then share that, but I assume it doesn't follow me like Glympse does. I'm pretty sure I can do this in Google Maps as well. Just to be clear though — the forthcoming Google Maps feature will actively follow you, like Glympse does now? So for example two people can share their location with one another, and find each other, in real time, on the map, like they can now with Glympse? Because really, I think that's easily within one of the top 10 coolest things you can do with smartphones, as well as identify songs (SoundHound, Shazam, and others), tune in to TVs in bars/restaurants (Tunity), listen to your hometown's radio if you're not there (TuneIn Radio), and ride sharing/modern taxi (Uber/Lyft). Oh, and paying for stuff with your phone (Android/Apple/Samsung Pay). Gerardo Sarabia Yes, it's gonna follow you. This options was called Latitude as a feature of Google Maps, it's just making a comeback and I think this time is here to stay. You can replace Glympse now... or in a few hours when the feature goes live for everybody. Nathan J I think I remember Latitude. Blue arrow icon, actually came with Maps in Android 2.x? Or was that the navigation shortcut? Because I remember that vaguely. So the feature is a server side flip as opposed to an app update? I just checked and I see no updates. Of course, I'm on the dark side, though Opinion Rewards aside, Google doesn't tend to show preference to Android over iOS. To much dismay of Android loyalists. I'll definitely give it a shot, though. Gerardo Sarabia Your app is probably up to date, Google just needs to activate the feature from their servers, very likely that's gonna happen today. demarcmj The blue arrow was navigation. The Latitude icon looked like this... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e4f9c487ba8715d966da912006582bdbeca4f72be72b020376ca3cc01efcc1c.jpg 4Ui812 Is it just me or did all these issues with Google start cropping up around the time as the name change to alphabet ? Rob Also think so Chcheri Do I have to add all the people I share my location with (and vice versa) all over again? Morten Ulv That's safe to assume, yes. gus70 Yes Lynxy I have maps location sharing available, am on beta if that helps. Morten Ulv Screenshots? Lynxy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/64e265fd1fee3fc21017bb901a69f0c832eba0bd600d5cc9500136a08ee03d4f.png Morten Ulv Awesome. Looks like the rollout has begun, ever so slightly. When did you get it? Lynxy Not completely sure, I checked when the first AP article came out a couple of days ago and it wasn't there yet, checked today if G+ already removed it and followed the link from G+ app to Maps and it worked :) Lynxy This is interesting, you can add a shortcut to quickly share with a specific person: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/12a5b1883abb166cc9afa14f2fab1376824dded2e48c760b342f7193cff8f36b.png Sebastian Is anyone able to enable this for Circles? MaximumFish Well that explains why my sharing list was empty yesterday. I just thought everyone had simultaneously decided they didn't like me - including my wife. Didn't get any message about the service moving to Maps either. James Bray Looks like you only get that message if you open Google+ and then click locations. Using a widget or something just takes you to an empty tracking list. Ryan And only after a G+ update. Mine was like his, mine had been broken prior to getting the update for G+ cdotlawrence https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1882d22c61331730c54a3233ce104b4123ceaab2599a2a8214f4ec5c6bb04e6a.png I gots it Imre niiiiice Oxfordmark Nothing! :( demarcmj The rollout is starting. Other people across the internet are getting it too. Total Insecurity Like me (in Germany). Ron Christensen Jr. What the heck? My menu doesn't have "share location" .... Should I uninstall and install? I have an android... Rod Google always slowly rolls out new features. You'll receive it in the next couple days. Ryan Server side switch. Mine just showed up, no restart or update at all. If anything maybe just terminate the app so it has to launch, but nothing more.

You didn't blur your email at it... ;-) Bo Mathis Google starting to operate like our federal government (of Zimbabwe)😕 Fifth313ment This happened to me yesterday on both myself and my wife's phone. Thank god we have Waze (Google Owned also, arg) as we could still see if each other got to work and home safely. This is just another example of Google's arrogance as a company and as their own SJW objectives. I only use Google as nothing else works like it does and the integration is great even though they are douchesacks. They took away Google Latitude to force everyone to Google Plus and now they are going back to Google Maps but without just pushing over our already shared contacts instead of making millions of people have to go over everything step by step again. I get calls from angry Google users (almost always older) everyday as Google arbitrarily changes things like icons in Google maps or icons here or there. They simply can't stick with anything for more than a few months. And with before someone says everything they provide is FREE, that is BS. They know where I work, where I go for lunch, what stores I shop at, how long I stay there, which ways I go home, what I search for all without me having to post anything on ANY social media site ( I don't have dacebook). So everyone is paying Google one way or another even by having just a Gmail account. The sad part is that it makes our lives so much better that we really have no other choice unless we want to go back to paper, pen and a map. Fluck off Google and you're left wing SJW agenda. Fluck you for changing everything constantly. You are no better than Microsoft removing the start button douchesacks (trying to avoid censors). And the whole sad part of this rant is there is nothing I, or any of us, can do about it as there are no good replacements for them (and I domt want to hear about M$ and Bing/Live B$). /rant johnforamerica Holy shit man... How can I subscribe to your anti-SJW newsletter? jibust I already have the new location sharing on Google Maps, but I'm on the beta program. noodlynooman Did you need to do anything special to get it? I am on the beta program too and don't have location sharing yet. jibust No, just using the latest version 9.49.2 Bo Mathis Android Police is the only news source that has reported this; hats off to you guys. Google, who I have immense respect for, dropped a turd on this one. The lack of communication between division (Google+ and Google Maps) has left a GAP instead of an OVERLAP in the location sharing feature. Inexcusable. Michael Tran This happened at such a bad time. Family member was over an hour late without response and I went to check for location in Google plus just to come across this!! Needless to say I was freaking out a bit. Bad move Google! We came out on the positive side of things but a company as big as Google should be able to get the little things right. demarcmj Fixed the title for you Rita... "Google disables location sharing in Google+ before enabling it for anyone in Google Maps" Kaleb Peters Yeah the title confused me too... What I first got from it was Google disabled G+ locations and then enabled Maps locations And I thought "so what's the problem?" augustojr Also sucks that even if Google enables it for me doesn't mean it will enable it for my friends and family. Chris Sanner this is, in fact, bullshit. Jordan L Doesn't their "Trusted Contacts" app how location sharing ability. Is that out for iOS yet? demarcmj It's not the same. You can't leave it on all the time, it's not conveniently bundled in the Maps app, and it has annoying notifications any time you share and/or request location. It has it's own uses, but it's not the same. Ocepi Almost got in trouble with my wife because of this, she thought I was "hiding". Facebook messenger just added an option to share location as well, but it's limited to 60 minutes at a time. Poor form Google. Midas Gordon-Farleigh Agree. The rollouts take so long... cocolopecita Seriously, dude? Your wife HAS TO KNOW where you are at all times? Hello marial issues! Kath Stennett I use location sharing in Google + with several contacts, extremely useful when we/they are travelling so I'm very annoyed that it has been removed but is not available in Maps yet. What dreadful planning on Google's part! Also the help seems to imply that we'll all have to set our sharing up again once it is available! Is that really true? We didn't need to when this moved from Latitude to Google +, I found that all my contacts were still located. It could take ages to liaise with everyone and get it set back up again DragoCubed Google keeps messing stuff up. I'm getting really tired of this. Red Bungholes. Stacy Scott Way to screw the pooch. You suck google. Stacy Scott So for those that see location sharing is it obvious how this works? DeAno Jackson I have the feature in my Google Maps. Unfortunately no one else I know does yet, so I can't even test it. Jonathan Campbell So, I just updated Google+ and that enabled sharing in maps somehow. Maps version is still 9.49.2 but no sharing before G+ update then immediately enabled after update. This seems pretty odd. Midas Gordon-Farleigh Coincidence! I just updated G+ and no such luck. Paul Arbour On again, off again. Last night locations in G+ turned off, then it was back, now it's gone again. then this morning it was back again, now it's gone again, and it isn't in maps yet.. Thanks Google. Kent @khouryrt:disqus Just got a Google+ update. Clicking on locations on the latest app goes to the new share page for Maps. Happy sharing. Ciro Santilli Does it work on iOS? If not implies useless for me. makapav GODDAMN IT GOOGLE DID NOT MIGRATE ANYONE FROM GOOGLE+ LOCATIONS!!! 50 people on my list have to go through the ordeal again!!! This is ridiculous! L. Curtis Muldrew I have it now ... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/298c13bd4ed2cecd8419d9e079a1e0f6d158767ed776658f2e0e57f3e5bbc667.png Dan Brown Maddening Google!! Michael Tran Looks like it's working now. It was enabled on one phone for me so I forced closed maps on my primary and it started working. Seems there is an option to share indefinitely, but I'm trying to figure out if that leaves GPS on all the time or does it just update periodically. All the location sharing folks i had before in G+ got wiped out so I have to send out requests all over again. JSet12 I just force closed Maps (per your comment), and it worked for me as well! Thanks. noodlynooman I think it only updates periodically with indefinite sharing. My fiance has his location shared with me indefinitely and last I checked his location was updated 9 minutes ago. Michael Tran Thanks. This is looking to be a solid replacement so far. Another confusing part is which contact so you share with? I see notification and I see their Gmail address. I wonder what the difference is. Ian Salter I was able to initialize the feature by watching this video and then tapping on the embedded link https://youtu.be/u62nPKgLJeg augustojr I just got it. Yaffle It's enabled for me now in Maps Adam Margeson Now I can't select whether a contact can see my exact location or just city level. Question... does this drain the battery any faster than G+ locations did? ctaylor Location Sharing is live for me, running 9.49.2. has been for a few days. But it's not live for my friends. Go Google! cocolopecita First thing I do in every gmail account I set up for relatives: disable location. Why people want Google to keep tabs on them on behalf of the NSA? Beats me.

Let's hope they at least fix the iOS unpredictable delays in location updates that can be as much as 12 hours. Robert England I have lost everybody I had shared location track with, how to refind?

Most of the pay consisted of Alphabet stock that the company valued at $198.7 million in securities documents filed Friday. Alphabet gave the award to Pichai in January 2016, a few months after he succeeded Larry Page as Google's CEO. Pichai still reports to Page, a Google co-founder who is now Alphabet's CEO. Page limits his annual pay to $1 because he already has an estimated fortune of $41 billion. The stock that Pichai received will vest in quarterly increments through January 2020. The 44-year-old Pichai also received a $650,000 salary last year in addition to personal security services and air travel valued at $372,000.

(Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) By Claire M. Regan STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Move over, Apple CEO Tim Cook. Paul Sebastian Jara wants your job. He may only be 10, but a future in technology is on the horizon for this confident and articulate fourth-grader, a member of the tech squad at PS 21 in Elm Park. Under the direction of media library teacher Patricia Wong, Paul has become as familiar with Google docs, GIFs and links as he is with fractions, adverbs and the American Revolution. "I learned how to type before I learned how to print," boasts Paul, who uses a MacBook Pro at home. "I'm gonna work for Apple because it's No. 1 in technology." Paul Sebastian Jara, a PS 21 fourth-grader, plans to be a computer engineer and work for Apple. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) He and his tech squad pals, Luis Davila and Mario Solis, have decided they will major in computer engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken and room together in the dormitory. Technology is a priority at PS 21, where all teachers use SMART Boards and students work on laptops in a second-floor media library. Next year, every classroom will be equipped with Google Chromebooks and the lower grades will have access to iPads. New SMART Boards for the school are on the way, thanks to funding from Borough President James Oddo and Councilwoman Debi Rose. The auditorium in 111-year-old PS 21 features wooden seats and other historic details. Principal Anthony Cosentino, center, is joined by Allison Graham, left, assistant principal, and Melissa Neglia, teacher and UFT chapter chair leader. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) "We are preparing them for jobs that do not exist yet," says Anthony Cosentino, finishing his second year as PS 21's forward-thinking principal. "We want to give them a wide range of skills for jobs that will be available 20 years from now. We want our kids to be more marketable." The school has built its own website and uses Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to share news and accomplishments. Located on Hooker Place, in the shadow of the Bayonne Bridge and a few blocks from Port Richmond High School, PS 21 was built 111 years ago with separate entrances marked "Girls" and "Boys." A small annex was added in 1996. Zion Tobee and Sariya Harris are kindergarten mathematicians at PS 21. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) Most classrooms are in the original two-story building, which features the perfect mix of modern amenities and old-world charm. A petite auditorium accommodates 200 in vintage wooden seats; the stage has built-in benches with cushions. PS 21's 20th-century architects did not include a gymnasium in the design, but that doesn't bother physical education teacher Melissa Neglia who makes use of the spacious school yard for her classes. NURTURING ENVIRONMENT "Good morning, Mr. C!" the fifth-grade class recites in perfect unison as Principal Cosentino pays a visit on a recent Friday morning. First-graders Alexandra Hernandez-Pavia and Iris Camacho visit with PS 21 Principal Anthony Cosentino, affectionately known as "Mr. C" in the Elm Park school. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) Energetic and athletic, 35-year-old Cosentino logs a few miles every day inside his school building, spending more time fist-bumping his 382 students and greeting visiting parents than seated in his office. His staff includes one assistant principal and 33 teachers. "The staff is a great team," he says with characteristic humility. "They are really invested in what we're trying to do here. I'm very fortunate as a principal." Cosentino fosters a family atmosphere and welcomes "pop-up moms" like Janet Rosa who frequently stop by to check on a child's progress. Janet Rosa gathers with her five children, all students at PS 21. In the front are Elijah DelCampo, Joshua Angelette, Joseph Angelette and Venus Angelette. Standing next to his mom is fifth-grader Aziz Thomas. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) "I peek in (the classroom door) and try to catch my oldest to see what he's doing," explains Rosa about fifth-grader Aziz Thomas. "I watch him interact." "This school is a second home for many kids; they can't wait to come here" she continues. "Mr. C makes kids and parents feel comfortable. If there is an issue, he'll drop what he's doing and address it." "I wish this school went to eighth grade," she adds, noting that Aziz, the eldest of five siblings at PS 21, heads off to junior high next year. Caroline Blake, left, Santiago Barrios and Christopher Espinel learn about right angles in fourth-grade math class. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) Principal Cosentino recently introduced My Hero and Me, an eight-week program that celebrates fatherhood and fosters positive role modeling. Kids and dads bond during a different after-school activity each week, including martial arts, break dancing, jiu-jitsu, woodworking and basketball. "It gets more fathers into the building," says Charles Fernando, who has served as PS 21's guidance counselor "for six happy years." Cultivating good citizens is also a priority at the Elm Park school. After a vigorous campaign season that coincided with the national election season last fall, class leaders were elected in all grades based on the strength of their platforms and speeches. PS 21 fifth-grader Lester Collins joins science teacher Maria Littreal before class begins. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) PS 21 students develop an awareness of the environment in Maria Littreal's science classes where they learn about recycling and organics and how to save energy. PS 21 this year reduced energy usage by 19 percent and won the Green Design Lab Energy Challenge sponsored by the Department of Education (DOE). PS 21 is also a Zero Waste School, recognized by the city Department of Sanitation for its recycling and sustainability efforts. DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY A native of the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, Principal Cosentino moved to West Brighton with his family when he was 9 years old. Principal Cosentino visits with PS 21 kitchen staffers Monica Bruno, left, Edward Levin and Jeanne Galano. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) He graduated from Blessed Sacrament School and Monsignor Farrell High School and earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Fordham University and a master's degree in education from Wagner College. He later completed the DOE's Leaders in Education Apprenticeship Program and the Advanced Leadership Program for Assistant Principals, sponsored by the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators. Cosentino worked for a year at Geller House, the intervention center for adolescents in Arrochar, then at Monsignor Farrell before transitioning into the public school system with a teaching position at the Hungerford School Annex in New Springville. He served as an assistant principal in Brooklyn for three-and-a-half years and was appointed principal of PS 21 in summer 2015. Third-graders McKayla Rolon and Leanna Collins are eager to see the seeds they planted grow into radishes. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) "We've made a lot of progress in 18 months," he says, referring to a 13-percent jump in English Language Arts (ELA) test scores and a 10-percent increase in science test scores. PS 21 has been recognized by the DOE as a Respect for All School in recognition of its work to promote a community of inclusion. A rich after-school program offers crocheting, Zumba, calligraphy, coding, robotics and cooking. Next year, a college and career readiness office will open at PS 21, sponsored by the Wagner College Port Richmond Partnership. It will be the first of its kind in a New York State elementary school, Principal Cosentino points out, enabling PS 21 to collaborate with Markham Intermediate School and Port Richmond High School, also participants in the Wagner initiative. "When students leave PS 21, we want them to know that college is not just a possibility, it's an expectation," he says.

Phone leaker Sonny Dickson tweeted Thursday that the device, which would run using the company’s voice assistant Siri and its AirPlay functionality, would use the Siri voice assistant and AirPlay functionality.  Read: Apple smart speaker in the works? He further said that the device would use the company’s Beats Audio technology and will run on iOS. While Apple is still mum on the device’s existence, let alone its features, there are chances that the company could launch the device at the World Wide Developers Conference in June in San Francisco. Here are five expected specs of the device: Facial recognition tech: According to CNET, the device might have a built-in camera like the Amazon Echo Look to detect multiple users. Voice-based smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have a problem doing so and sometimes get confused between voices. A built-in camera would help the speakers respond to both visual and audio input, which means differentiating between users will be much easier.    Beats Audio: Apple’s devices have generally received good feedback for their audio and the company has its own wireless earphones, AirPods, which it sells separately for $159. So, its eventual move towards speakers is not unexpected. The company is expected to employ Beats Audio technology in the speaker, which could have a concave Mac Pro-like design with audio and other controls at the concave top. Beats Audio is the name for signature noise-cancelling technology that Apple uses in its devices to provide its users with clear audio. For the speaker, it might involve the use of components such as high-grade plastic and insulated wires to ensure clear audio. Touchscreen: Unlike Google and Amazon’s devices, Apple is not just making a smart speaker that responds to your voice, but one that is iOS-based. This means that the device will have a touchscreen, which would give you access to multiple apps at once. Say, for example you use the Nike+ running app. You might be able to get the speaker to simply put out your running targets and tell you how far you are from your goal by connecting to the app. Improved Siri: Apple has been expected to have an improved version of Siri for some time to match up with the evolving functionality of the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, apart from other artificial intelligence based voice assistants such as Cortana. The company could probably unveil an improved version of Siri, which would be designed to support the smart speaker. Read: Apple’s Self Driving Car In The Works? Smart home functionality: The essential reason behind Apple designing a smart speaker is its goal of creating a smart Home, something CEO Tim Cook has indicated many times in the past. The Apple smart speaker is expected to be compatible with its HomeKit framework for communicating and controlling connected devices.        Related Stories What Are Sheeple?

Austria seeks to tax it anyway You think Google Search is free? Austria seeks to tax it anyway Austria is seeking ways to make digital services like Google or Facebook Inc. pay taxes for transactions with the nation’s internet users. By: Bloomberg | Vienna | Updated: April 30, 2017 4:52 pm Raising more taxes from digital businesses is part of a broader plan to amend the country’s corporate tax code. (Image for representation, Source: Google) Austria is seeking ways to make digital services like Alphabet Inc.’s Google or Facebook Inc. pay taxes for transactions with the nation’s internet users, trying to plug gaps in a tax system still designed for brick-and-mortar business. The most ambitious part of the plan targets the business models of Twitter Inc., Google or Facebook: The tacit pact under which searching, liking, posting and tweeting remains free as long as users let the companies feed usage data into algorithms that help tailor advertising that can be aimed at the most likely buyers. That arrangement is a form of bartering, and a value-added tax could be imposed on such transactions just as the levies are extended in other parts of the economy, said Andreas Schieder, the parliamentary head of Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern’s Social Democrats, which govern in a coalition with the conservative People’s Party. “The business transaction that’s going on here is that users are paying with their personal data,” Schieder told journalists in Vienna. “The business model of those internet companies is based on massive revenues that are generated with the help of those data.” Amending Code Raising more taxes from digital businesses is part of a broader plan to amend the country’s corporate tax code. The package also includes closing loopholes that allow “aggressive tax planning” and corporate tax avoidance, which cost the Alpine country as much as 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) a year, about a fifth of its annual corporate tax revenue, Schieder said. The Social Democrats’ plan has two other elements targeted at internet companies: It would extend the Austrian tax on advertising revenue to digital formats, and it would tax purely digital services that are acquired by Austrian customers from companies with no physical presence in the country.

(AP/Jeff Chiu) Alphabet Inc. can’t seem to stop heaping massive pay packages on Google’s Sundar Pichai. The chief executive officer of the search-engine unit received $199.7 million in compensation for 2016, according to a regulatory filing Friday. That marks his third straight year getting nine-figure pay -- a rare accomplishment even at well-paying technology companies and virtually unheard of in other industries. Since he became CEO in 2015, Pichai has moved to give Google more control over two critical fields: artificial intelligence and cloud. He oversaw a 17.8 percent jump in Google’s core ads business last year, while also boosting its revenue in cloud and hardware, a long-sought goal of the company. Pichai’s 2016 compensation consisted mainly of 273,328 Class C shares that vest quarterly through 2019 if he remains on the job. The award was granted about six months after the tech business announced it would reorganize into holding company Alphabet. As part of the transition, Pichai was tapped to lead Google, taking the reins from Larry Page who became chief executive of the parent entity. Read also: Google Street View to capture running and walking trails in Singapore It wasn’t the first time following in Page’s footsteps led to big payouts for Pichai. In 2015, he got about $100 million in reported compensation after he was promoted to senior vice president of products and took over many of Page’s responsibilities overseeing areas such as search and ad products. That made him one of the highest-paid U.S. executives that year, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. His biggest pay package that can be gleaned from filings came in 2014. He got 442,424 shares worth about $250 million in August that year, shortly before his promotion. The stock will be fully vested in 2018. Since Alphabet wasn’t required to disclose his compensation at the time, filings don’t reveal why he received such a large grant. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the award. Alphabet also didn’t disclose any salary or cash bonus paid to Pichai in 2014. The Mountain View, California-based company typically grants equity awards to top bosses once every two years, a strategy it has said “encourages executives to take a long-term view of the business.” Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat got a $39.1 million pay package for 2016, most of it in a stock award that vests through 2019.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that? That Waymo, even though recently put into its own company, has not made use of that skill? Why would they not? » reply automated transport Submitted by jim (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 11:08. If you rephrase the question as "Which company is likely to profit the most from automated transportation in the next ~15 years? I would respond : Amazon I would think that automating the package delivery business is a better defined and easier problem than automating taxies. And Amazon is well on its way automating the package delivery business. I would be surprised if they don't already have a plan in place to cut the labor cost of delivering a package by a factor of 10 in the next 10 years. » reply Online retail Submitted by brad on Fri, 2017-04-07 09:40. Will indeed profit nicely, but it’s small compared to personal transportation. Delivery services around the world are a few hundred billion dollars. Personal transport is 5 trillion. » reply OEMs are the wrong segment to examine Submitted by Alison Chaiken (not verified) on Sat, 2017-04-29 22:48. The popular press always ranks automakers since the public knows their names and will buy the reports. In automotive ecosystem, this is wrong thinking. The companies that are really developing the technology are not just the Sili Valley favorites, but also Tier 1's and Tier 2's like Continental, Bosch (as you astutely point out) and Nvidia. Both Tesla and Audi run Nvidia's Tegra, making me wonder how different their systems really are. comma.ai also ran with the Nvidia Jetson board. BMW has partnered with Intel and Mobileye. Perhaps if the autonomy gold rush falters, Conti, Bosch, Harman, Nvidia and Intel will profit most. » reply Nvidia as a base Submitted by brad on Sun, 2017-04-30 02:30. Nvidia GPUs are, from this viewpoint, general purpose massively multicore processors. It’s all in the software, so there does not have to be any similarity in how Tesla and Audi and comma.ai use them. Now they are all doing neural networks with them but that’s again a platform rather than an algorithm. Tier Ones are working on it, but OEMs are scared of not owning what may become the more important tech in the car. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

By Rüdiger Kiani-Kreß Published on 30. April 2017, 12:00 Why it matters Why it matters Digital giants have the means to predict customer needs and calculate the most profitable routes. Traditional airlines could be reduced to passenger carriers supplying flights for Google & Co. Facts Facts Lufthansa intends to up the firm’s current innovation budget of €500 million. It has a chatbot to update customers on cheap flights via Facebook Messenger and an app to guide customers through airports. The company has cut costs by digitalizing admin and cutting a level off management. Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Lufhansa chief Carsten Spohr hopes digitalization will allow Lufthansa to boost customer loyalty through new offerings. Source: Nils Broeer/WirtschaftsWoche Around two dozen men and women in hoodies gather on the fourth floor of an age-worn building in central Berlin. The room has long table, scattered stools and walls covered with gummed notes. Their job is to develop a company that will put the kind of pressure on airlines that Uber applied to the taxi trade. Their secret weapon is new data from mobile phones and web searches that can be deployed to offer customers tailor-made deals. This attack on the airline industry last fall was only a simulated exercise, held at Lufthansa’s digital field office known as the Innovation Hub. But it fired the starting gun for the most important project in the company’s future. Participants were drawn from the upper managerial echelon of Europe’s largest airline. “We have to have the best digital offers in the industry,” Spohr says. “Digitalization is becoming more and more important to our future.” These days, every top manager has trite statements like this ready. But Mr. Spohr, who has finally made it out the other end of a damaging dispute with pilots, is deadly serious. He believes the industry is facing its biggest threat since budget airlines appeared on the scene. So far, companies with huge troves of data like Google and Facebook, as well as reservation portals like Booking.com and Airbnb and travel apps like Tripadvisor, have yet to get into the air travel business. But that could be about to change. Mr. Spohr’s nightmare is that they strike at the very heart of established airlines’ business model. In a worst case scenario, airlines like Lufthansa could be reduced to mere passenger carriers, paid a pittance to execute the flight plans of Google & Co. The digital giants have an almost insurmountable lead. “Above all, with the data gathered from mobile phones about search and travel behavior, they know better than the airlines what travelers want and how much they are willing to pay for it,” says Nawal Taneja, an independent consultant and former professor of aviation management at Ohio State University. The digital giants are sitting on data from every area of life. That means they can better predict customers’ wishes, calculate the most profitable routes – and potentially take a commanding role in the sector. They could simply rent jet kilometers at rock-bottom prices from traditional airlines, which would become interchangeable. This scenario is all the more threatening because brand loyalty is vanishing. A survey by the flight search engine Priceline shows that most passengers don’t care which airline they fly. What matters is that it is reasonably safe and offers good prices. “This offers ideal opportunities to a provider that customers already entrust with data about sensitive aspects of their life,” says Thomas Jaeger, head of data provider CH-Aviation in Switzerland. Search engine Skyscanner is paving the way. Together with British market researcher Anna.aero, it analyzes flight inquiries and determines not just the world’s most popular connections but also the most lucrative nonstop routes not yet served by an airline. “As a rule, those routes are soon offered by an airline,” says Anna.aero chief executive Paul Hogan. New competitors could use this knowledge to include such routes in their own programs. Mr. Spohr hopes digitalization will allow Lufthansa to “not only reduce costs but also create more customer loyalty and higher returns through new products.” He intends to up the firm’s innovation budget of €500 million, or $546 million. From passenger jets to maintenance hangars, all areas of the sleepy company are to be shaken up and brought to startup speed. Internet giants like to implement new projects in record time. “If Amazon can get its own freight fleet of 30 jets in the air within one year, that shows how quickly someone completely new to the industry can penetrate our commercial core with the right business model,” says Lufthansa’s Christian Langer. The company has tasked Mr. Langer with monitoring how new digital business models from Silicon Valley are squaring off against the top dogs. The 45-year-old doesn’t look like a typical digital boss. Instead of hoodie, the IT graduate wears a coat and tie. A long way from the startup hub of Berlin, his office at Hamburg Airport does without sofas for lounging or a grill-equipped patio. In front of Mr. Langer’s office is a bowl of fruit instead of adrenaline-stimulating candy; inside, the PC is exiled to a corner. A bookcase dominates the walls, along with a frighteningly analogue whiteboard. Want to keep reading? Subscribe now or log in to read our coverage of Europe’s leading economy.

According to a filing from Google’s parent company, Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), the company’s compensation committee attributed the generous pay to Pichai’s promotion to CEO and “numerous successful product launches.” Alphabet’s stock has soared this year, pushing it above a $600 billion market cap this week for the first time. Pichai’s base pay was a mere $650,000. On top of that, he received a stock award for $198.7 million, reports CNN. Under Pichai’s leadership and keen eye, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing. In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice controlled smart speaker similar to the Amazon Echo. And clearly, these efforts have started to pay off for the company. A seasoned Google executive, Pichai had taken over as CEO as part of a corporate restructuring in 2015, while Larry Page, Google’s cofounder and previous CEO, shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella. Pichai’s massive pay package came even as his two bosses and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, once again drew salaries of only $1 for their roles as CEO and President, respectively, of parent company Alphabet. But Page and Brin are each worth more than $40 billion through their stock holdings. According to the report, Pichai’s raise came during a year when Google’s sales rose 22.5%and net income rose 19%as it maintained its position as the top seller of internet advertising.   Share this Post: « Previous Article Sarpanch's wife debarred from puja in Ahmednagar Next Article » Gram Sabhas to pass resolution on farmers’ loan waiver issue Tagged with: Alphabet umbrella Amazon Echo Google CEO Sundar Pichai JUST ARRIVED Mumbai: 9 injured in Matunga as Scorpio collides with truck head on SAARC satellite, envisioned by Modi, set to take off: High-flying facts IPL 2017: Lasith Malinga has a laugh after seeing his lookalike in the audience.

Not anymore. The business, categorized as "Other Revenue" in its earnings report, posted a 49.4 percent jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday – a sum already bigger than Twitter Inc's annual revenue. The business now represents about 13 percent of Alphabet's total revenue, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but definitely shines a light on Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc. "(Google) is doing a good job, a much better job in diversifying revenue than Facebook is," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "We think that is quite an impressive achievement." The alphabet does not break out revenue contribution within the "Other Revenue" segment. But analysts have said that cloud is the most prominent among the category's clutch of businesses. To be sure, Google's cloud venture is still much smaller than market leader Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp's Azure. But Google is investing heavily. "In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in the cloud," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Amazon's cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft's cloud unit grew 93 percent. "We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google's hardware products, we see Google's 'other' revenue growing 38 percent to nearly $14 billion in 2017," Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note. The company's hardware business also started gaining traction after Google released a pair of high-profile hardware products last year - the Pixel phone and the Google Home, a smart speaker like Amazon's Echo. "People are hankering for a really awesome Android phone that basically gives them the iPhone experience," Wang said, adding that the growth in Google's "other revenue" bucket this quarter "shows sustained momentum for the Pixel." Still, the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue comes from ads and that's not going to change anytime soon. Total advertising revenue increased 18.8 percent to $21.1 billion in the first quarter, the company reported on Thursday. Profit also rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, beating Wall Street estimates. At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after the earnings report. Alphabet's drive for diversification also includes its "Other Bets" business, considered the company's loss-making arm. The business, home to the Waymo self-driving car, Google Fiber and thermostat-maker Nest, posted a first-quarter loss of $855 million. Google's shares were up 4.6 percent at a record high of $932.73 on Friday morning. They have gained 12.5 percent this year up to Thursday's close. 0 0 Google's search for non-ad revenue puts spotlight on cloud, Pixel was posted in Sci-Tech of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on April 30, 2017 and was last updated on April 30, 2017.

Google has guaranteed Android OS support till October 2018, and security patches will continue to roll out till October 2019. This means that the debut Pixel devices will receive OS support for two years, and security updates for three years. The dates are the same for both the Pixel and the larger Pixel XL devices. The Android version used in the Pixel devices are “vanilla” OS versions, that receive software updates directly from Google. The last Android OS that is expected to land for the Pixel devices is the as yet unnamed Android P. The dates are not absolute indications of when the updates will stop rolling out. Google has indicated that it cannot guarantee the availability of updates beyond two years for OS versions, and beyond three years for security patches, after the release of the device. Google has also guaranteed security updates for eighteen months after the device stops selling in the Google store. The software updates typically reach the device within two weeks of rolling out.

The equation says that happiness is greater than, or equal to, your perception of the events in your life minus your expectation of how life should be. When his 21-year-old son Ali died during a routine operation, Gawdat turned to the equation, which they had worked on together, in an attempt to come to terms with his tragic loss. Gawdat’s book, Solve for Happy, explains the theories underpinning the equation and how it helped him sustain his life after Ali’s death. To an outsider you were a successful, wealthy individual with a loving family; not an obvious candidate for someone who felt the need to devote themselves to developing a theory of happiness. You say the more money you had, the less happy you became. That is correct and it’s not uncommon among many of my successful and wealthy friends. The scientific research will tell you that the more income you get the more happy you will become, but once you get to average income your happiness plateaus. Moreover, I found that when you go even higher, wealth starts to work against you – people start to treat you differently; you start to feel a constant disappointment. You mention that while you were on the “hedonistic treadmill” you bought two Rolls-Royces online on a whim. That truly was a turning point. This was again the attempt to fill that gap in my soul. When they arrived I was completely disappointed, they were pretty, I sat in them for 20 minutes but then I went back to my unhappy thoughts, and once you go back to the things that make you unhappy it doesn’t matter what’s parked in the garage. That was a turning point, that nothing material will solve this stuff. Do you still have them? I’ve been trying to sell them, I’ve tried giving them to charity. They are in showrooms waiting to be sold. I rent cars now. You weren’t able to find joy in your life. Is finding joy a skill that should be taught? Absolutely. Happiness is very much like staying fit. You start with the decision that you are going to get fit, you find out how – but knowing that is not enough, you have to go to the gym to work out and eat healthily. To me the whole topic of happiness is exactly the same. First you understand that happiness is a choice, that you can actually achieve it and that there is a method to make it happen. Happiness is not a coincidence, it is not given to you by life, it’s entirely our responsibility. When your son died, did you feel like jettisoning your theories? Are you surprised that your equation held up in such tragic circumstances? You know how there are five stages of grief? We started with acceptance. My wife at the time made an insightful comment when they asked to do an autopsy on Ali’s body: “Will it bring Ali back?” The realisation that nothing we could do, including crying in our rooms for the next 17 years, would ever bring him back… we started from there. I then went through a rollercoaster. But I would sometimes imagine talking to Ali and if you knew him, his first reaction would be: “Papa I’ve already died, there’s nothing you can do about it, so what are you going to make out of it?” When I started going through this dialogue it made me realise that this can be for a reason, for good can come out of it. Do you ever wonder how you would have responded to your son’s death if you hadn’t developed your happiness equation? I would have definitely left life, I wouldn’t have killed myself, but I would have found a corner somewhere and shut the door and sat there until they came. Ali was not just my son, he was my mentor, best friend, confidante, my teacher, he truly was “it”, basically. I can’t imagine I would have handled it at all without the model we built together. You talk about how happiness is a human’s default state. Where’s your evidence for this? That was one of the eye-openers for me. The first observation was I was a very happy young man until around 25, and then something went wrong, and I became very unhappy. To me, an engineer, that means you have a highly optimised machine that began to misbehave. So I started to go back to all the points where I was happy. If you go back to childhood, you observe that if a child’s basic needs are met their default state is happy – they don’t need an iPhone, they can play with their toes and be happy. You say that the voice inside your head isn’t you. If we aren’t the voices inside our heads, what are we? We have a set of illusions. One of them is that we associate so strongly with the voice in our head when the reality is that it is just a biological function; it is exactly like your heart pumping blood around your body. It’s your brain’s way of delivering survival functions to you – its job is to scan the world around it using sensory input and then coordinate your muscle responses and take action so that you survive. Thoughts have truly propelled our civilisation, and we think of the voice inside our heads as us. But that isn’t remotely true once you realise that you don’t have to obey your thoughts – I can accept them, I can reject them, I can ask the brain to go and get me a better one. You can do what people do in meetings: you ask me a question, I give you an answer, but you can say to me: “Mo, can you get me a better answer?”, and I go back to my brain and I say, give me a better answer. Treat your brain as a biological function and understand he is not the boss – you are the boss. Can you explain what you mean by the illusion of time? We deal with time every day, yet no one really knows what time is, including the master of the science of time Albert Einstein. He’ll tell you that past, present and future is nothing more than a stubborn persistent illusion. We have created machines that measure mechanical movement in such a way, yet we have no idea what it is that we are measuring and we are very happy to torture ourselves with it. Google's research sibling X shuts down drones project Read more If you ask a Buddhist what time it is, their answer will be “the time is now”. Like a Buddhist, the only time you have ever lived is a moment of now. You’ve never lived in the past, you will never live in the future; when the future comes it will be a moment of now. Yet we never give ourselves the luxury of living in now; instead, we are constantly living inside our heads looking in the past and the future, and as you do that you constantly suffer. Could you turn your equation into an app? Absolutely. I believe that the book is just the start of a very big initiative. I am trying to create a movement that doesn’t depend on me or the book. I’ve set myself a target of 10 million people happy, and I’m hoping that everyone will set themselves a target of 25 people or 25 million happy, depending on their reach. I’m not about selling books, I believe I’ve been paid by life already. In what sense was your quest to develop an equation for happiness informed by Google X’s moonshot philosophy, to set audacious rather than incremental goals? Absolutely, our CEO Larry Page teaches us to set an audacious target but while you may miss it, what you achieve is greater than if you set a low target. You are on a sabbatical from X? I have a tremendous respect for a company that does things that make the world a better place. Although public opinion sometimes attacks Google, imagine a life without search. I am one of the top execs in Google and I can tell you it is truly not a place about the money, this is a place that is truly about changing the world. When you go back to X what will you be working on? I can tell you but then I’d have to flash you like the Men in Black. • Solve for Happy  by Mo Gawdat is published by Bluebird (£14.99).

Read on to know Rating: 4.5 out of 5 Written by Shruti Dhapola | New Delhi | Updated: May 1, 2017 9:34 am So what does the Amazon Fire TV Stick do? Is it worth getting your hands on this, over the Google Chromecast? Read our review. Amazon has big plans for India. We now have Amazon Prime, Amazon Prime Video and the latest Fire TV Stick. Make note, India is the fifth country in the world where Amazon has launched this device, which shows just how much we matter as a market to Jeff Bezos. For viewers in India, the mode of viewing television has changed drastically. Your dumb TV set doesn’t have to remain dumb anymore. There are quite a few streaming devices available to help you play the content you might normally consume on smartphones on the big display. There’s the slightly expensive Apple TV, Amkette has its Evo TV series, and yes, the Google Chromecast. The Amazon Fire TV Stick will compete directly against the Google Chromecast, even though fundamentally there’s a big difference between how these two devices work. So what does the Amazon Fire TV Stick do? Is it worth getting your hands on this, over the Google Chromecast? Read our review. Specifications: MediaTek Quad-Core ARM 1.3 GHz | Mali450 MP4 |1 GB + 8 GB internal includes Free cloud storage for all Amazon content | Dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi 2×2 MIMO 802.11a/b/g/n/ac | Bluetooth 4.1 | Dimensions 85.9 mm x 30.0 mm x 12.6 mm and weight 32g | Voice Remote (included) Box includes: Amazon Fire TV Stick, Voice Remote, 2AAA batteries for remote, Power Adaptor, USB Cable, HDMI extender cable Price: Rs 3,999 Amazon Fire TV Stick As the name suggests, the Fire TV Stick is a stick, no bigger than a USB which you can just plug into your television slot. Yes, you will need a television which has an HDMI slot for this, and make sure you have another free power slot close by. This is because the Amazon Fire TV Stick needs to be plugged into one in order to work. There’s a micro-USB slot, which is used to charge the device. Plugging in the Amazon Fire TV Stick is pretty simple. The device is compact and doesn’t really require a lot of space. This comes with its own remote with voice control features. The Fire TV Stick is a stick, no bigger than a USB which you can just plug into your television slot. Once you have plugged in, use your television remote to go to the HDMI input page, and you’ll see the Amazon Fire TV Stick loading up. You’ll need to connect the stick to a WiFi in your house — Amazon recommends a minimum broadband speed of 4MB per second in your house for a smooth experience. Amazon is also offering batteries for the remote with the box, which is good thinking on their part. So what’s good? I honestly thought setting this thing up would be a pain, given I would have to type in my Amazon account information. Typing via a TV remote has never been a good experience. However, the Amazon Fire TV Stick set-up was really smooth. You can set a data limit on this, pick at what resolution you want to stream and put in place parental. Also if you buy this off Amazon, your information will be registered with this device, so you won’t have to type in your password when setting this up. The focus with Amazon Fire TV Stick is apps, and if you are an Amazon Prime Video member, you’ll love this. Apps like Netflix, YouTube, HotStar, Eros Now, Gaana, Voot, Voot Kids, etc are all available on this as well, so for those who are subscribed to these services, there’s more reason to rejoice. Plus, Amazon has some launch offers with Airtel Broadband, YouBroadband, Eros Now, Gaana, services, which should keep most users happy. The device is compact and doesn’t really require a lot of space. This comes with its own remote with voice control features. But the focus is on Amazon Prime Video content, which appears on the landing top banner. You can use the remote to move down, and check out the other apps and services, but make no mistake, the Amazon Prime Video content gets star treatment out here, which is not surprising. So far I’ve downloaded Netflix and YouTube on this because these services are where I primarily consume my video content. For those wondering if they can sign into YouTube with this, it is very simple. Like with most smart TVs with the YouTube app, once you have downloaded, go to the settings to sign in. You don’t have to enter your Gmail password out. Just enter your gmail account, and a code flashes on your screen that you then need to enter on Youtube.com/activate. It worked smoothly for me, and overall I’m glad I didn’t have to sit and type my password on another device. Moving onto the streaming quality, I’ve faced no issues with this one. Surprisingly, Amazon Prime Video content works like a charm, in fact better than what I’ve experienced with the mobile app, where I usually do need to pause in order for the full content to buffer. YouTube and Netflix work without any hiccups either. I’m not too impressed with the Voice Remote search and how it works with an app like YouTube. I started watching Mr Robot on the Fire TV Stick, and so far the streaming experience has been crisp with no problems at all. In my house, I’ve got a 50Mbps connection, so that does help. Navigating on this Fire TV Stick is also easy, thanks to the remote. The Voice Control remote gives options to pause, play, fast forward (three separate buttons at the bottom for this), there’s a main home page button, a back button and a menu button. There’s a separate circular navigation button, which lets you move around and explore more content. Finally, on top is the Voice button. The idea is you can say names of shows, actors, movies, and the content will appear. It works accurately with Amazon Prime Video content. So what’s not good? I’m not too impressed with the Voice Remote search and how it works with an app like YouTube. For instance, while it could accurately figure out the name of a particular YouTuber, the Fire TV Stick gave the message, “Didn’t find any matching results.” This is I thought was strange. Also you can’t do much with the Voice search. You can’t really give commands like Open Netflix and expect it to work. Amazon has a version of Fire TV Stick with Alexa in the US, but guess this will take some time to come to India. If you’re not an Amazon Prime member, it makes very little sense to get this. You can get the membership for Rs 499 for now, though later the price is expected to go up to Rs 999. So remember, you’ll need to keep paying a regular subscription fee to get the most out of this Fire TV Stick. Verdict Amazon Fire TV Stick works like it is supposed to: streaming your digital content onto your regular old dumb TV set. In my experience with this device, which is used gloriously on weekends, it has given me no cause to complain. I also have a Google Chromecast at home, which I’ve unplugged for now. The advantage with Amazon Fire TV Stick is that you are not dependent on your phone or tablet to cast the content onto your TV. Also most of the apps that are popular for digital content are easily available on this. It is pricier than the Chromecast though at Rs 3999 compared to the Rs 3,399 pricing of the latter. Remember both devices are still streaming at 1080p, and don’t offer 4K resolution. Eventually, the decision boils down to how much you want to pay for streaming content on your TV. When it comes to capabilities both devices are good choices, though the Fire TV Stick will at least leave your smartphone free.

Can it be used as a Chromecast replacement without being an Amazon Prime member? That is, will the device work at all if one isn't an APV member, or does it need you to be signed into your Amazon account in order to work?

Here is a summary of the day’s main developments: Theresa May has refused to rule out income tax and national insurance rises should she win the general election. The prime minister said she would not raise VAT, after Labour made a similar pledge but declined to make a similar pledge in respect of the other two taxes which make up the Conservative’s tax lock. In her first television interviews of the campaign, the prime minister also signalled she would ditch the“triple-lock” formula by which the state pension would increase each year. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said it would be wrong of May to drop the triple-lock formula on pensions. There were also suggestions that she was bounced into the pledge on VAT on Peston on Sunday after McDonnell vowed not to increase the tax, earlier on the same programme. McDonnell said that Labour would not increase income tax for middle or low earners. He did not define middle earners. The Royal College of Nursing criticised the prime minister for failing to address the issue of nurses’ pay and their use of foodbanks. When asked about the issue on BBC1’s Andrew Marr show, she replied that “there are many complex reasons why people go to food banks”. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested he is prepared to reverse £3bn cuts of primary school funding, due to impact between now and 2020. The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said May was on course for a “colossal coronation” and urged voters to make his party the official opposition in order to prevent a hard Brexit. The Lib Dems currently have just nine MPs compared to Labour’s 229.

Last week, the First Minister said the election was “not about independence or about another referendum”. During his weekly radio programme, Salmond told a listener that there would be another vote on Scotland’s future within five years, saying: The general election is to reinforce the right of the Scottish Parliament to decide when the time is right for another independence referendum and if you get that sort of overwhelming vote for the SNP, then the PM’s opposition will crumble. Asked by Andrew Neil on the BBC”s Sunday Politics programme if there was a different message being put by himself and Sturgeon, Salmond replied: No. I have said exactly the same as Nicola Sturgeon on that. The issue of independence will be decided in a national referendum of the Scottish people. The mandate for that referendum was gained in last year’s Scottish elections. What this election is about is backing the right of the Scottish Parliament to exercise that mandate and also providing real opposition to this Tory government and of course allowing the Scottish Parliament to resist austerity and some of the public expenditure cutbacks that you’ve been talking about. That is what this election is about: backing our Scottish Parliament.” Commenting on the interview, Scottish Labour General Election campaign manager James Kelly said: Alex Salmond’s car crash interview exposed the reality of the SNP’s record in government ... Alex Salmond let the cat out the bag last week when he said this election is about forcing another divisive independence referendum. When people go to the polls for the council elections on Thursday and the general election on 8 June they can vote Labour to elect a local champion; or they can vote SNP to elect a candidate who will only focus on another divisive referendum. Meanwhile a Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times Scotland found that 52% of voters believed the PM should not stand in the way of a fresh referendum if the First Minister made a manifesto commitment to try to secure one and won a majority of the Scottish seats. It placed support for independence at 45%, unchanged from the 2014 referendum.

The SNP won a landslide in Scotland In 2015, winning 56 out of 59 seats. Opinion polls have suggested the Tories will gain a number of seats from the Nationalists but the SNP are still expected to be the majority party.

Labour has committed to ensuring bosses in the public sector and private companies that carry out government work are not paid more than 20 times the wage of the firm’s lowest paid employee. Lavery failed to give a direct answer when asked a number of times by Andrew Neil on BBC1’s Sunday Politics what would happen if a defence contractor like BAE Systems bids to build more Joint Strike Fighter jets for the RAF, and the boss was paid more than 20 times the lowest paid worker. Lavery said: We would look at the issue as it came along but the policy is quite clear. Asked to name a defence contractor which has a boss with a salary that would fit with the ratio, he said: We would introduce and we are introducing, we’ve rolled that out as part of this fantastic policy to transform society, to get rid of discrimination, to try and bring together our communities, and we will introduce a pay ratio of 1:20.

The Andrew Marr Show (@MarrShow) Theresa May questioned on nurses using food banks #marr pic.twitter.com/LAJy6st8AW April 30, 2017 RCN chief executive and general secretary Janet Davies said: Theresa May was explicitly asked to admit that it is wrong for nurses to be forced to use foodbanks in 2017. Not only did she fail to acknowledge it is wrong, she failed to even mention nurses or their work in her reply. Nurses should not have to fund the NHS deficit from their own pay packets. Too many are struggling to make ends meet, turning to foodbanks and hardship grants in desperation. Every year that the government holds NHS pay below inflation, hundreds of thousands of nurses get another real-terms cut to their salary. “The government pay cap is fuelling a recruitment and retention crisis that is as damaging for patient care as it is for the nurses themselves. A growing number feel they can no longer afford to work in the profession and others are deterred from joining by the meagre pay on offer. “After the election, for the sake of patient safety, the government must scrap the pay cap and fill the tens of thousands of vacant jobs.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.53am EDT 07:53 More from the head teachers conference where Jeremy Corbyn was addressing the audience and hinted at a significant pledge on primary school funding: Freddie Whittaker (@FCDWhittaker) "I believe we are brave enough to reverse the £3bn cuts" says Corbyn.

On the Coffee House blog, the Spectator’s Fraser Nelson says her refusal to make “specific proposals on taxes” signifies “tax raises ahoy”. On May’s interview style, he writes: Theresa May has perfected the art of saying nothing in interviews. The most any journalist can hope for is a subtle shift in position, or an absence where a position once stood. She seems to think that, if you refuse to give the press anything, the public won’t care. Worse, she seems to be right – for now, at least. The Mirror has nine things we learned. They include: “She won’t take the blame for food banks.” It cites her reply to a question from Andrew Marr on their use, including by nurses, that “there are many complex reasons why people go to food banks”.

Nuttall, who is an MEP for the North West of England, announced his plans to stand in the constituency on Friday during a visit to Hartlepool, which is more than 165 miles away from his chosen seat. He told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he had been to Boston and Skegness “a fair few times”, insisting that he intended to “put the area on the map”. Nuttall said: This is the most eurosceptic seat within the country. We have got councillors right across the constituency. The branch were very keen for me to stand in this constituency and I was only too happy to take up their offer. Asked whether he knew the area, he said: I want to make a point here, people often say ‘Oh, you have to be from the local constituency’ - this isn’t a council election, this a parliamentary election. The vast majority of MPs, I would suggest to you, do not actually come from the constituency they represent. This is about putting this area on the map. I am a national political figure, I am a national party leader. When I stand up in the House of Commons to represent the seat of Boston and Skegness, people will listen.

Theresa May has signalled that she will ditch Conservative pledges not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT, as well as the triple-lock formula for state pension increases. The prime minister was unable to promise that any of the commitments would continue, just two years after the ‘tax lock’ formed a central plank of David Cameron’s 2015 election campaign. On BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, in her first long TV interview of the election campaign, the prime minister was pressed about whether theConservatives would keep their pledge not to raise the three key taxes. She claimed to have “absolutely no plans to increase the level of tax” and an intention to lower taxes on working families. But she added: “I don’t want to make specific pledges on taxes unless I’m sure I can deliver on those.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1 of 3 Newest Newer Older Oldest Topics General election 2017 Politics live with Andrew Sparrow Theresa May Conservatives Labour Jeremy Corbyn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Kitty is trying to be one of the first out of the gate and plans to start selling its vehicle by the end of the year. A number of start-ups as well as big aerospace firms are trying to build personal aircraft you could fly around town. (Kitty Hawk via The New York Times)   By John Markoff The New York Times April 30, 2017   Today’s Business stories Fulfilled to the brim: Eugene hat shop owner loves his job Top execs at Pacific Continental receiving ‘golden parachutes’ in bank sale Silicon Valley vies to get flying cars off the ground Business Datebook Business Beat More Business »   CLEARLAKE, Calif. — On a recent afternoon, an aerospace engineer working for a small Silicon Valley company called Kitty Hawk piloted a flying car above a scenic lake about 100 miles north of San Francisco. Kitty Hawk’s flying car, if you insisted on calling it a “car,” looked like something Luke Skywalker would have built out of spare parts. It was an open-seated, 220-pound contraption with room for one person, powered by eight battery-­powered propellers that howled as loudly as a speedboat. The tech industry is fond of disrupting things, and lately the automakers have been a big target. Cars that use artificial intelligence to drive themselves, for example, have been in development for a few years and can be spotted on roads in a number of cities. And now, coming onto the radar screen, are flying machines that do not exactly look like your father’s Buick with wings. More than a dozen startups backed by deep-pocketed industry figures like Larry Page, a Google founder — along with big aerospace firms like Airbus, the ride-hailing company Uber and even the government of Dubai — are taking on the dream of the flying car. The approaches by the companies vary and the realization of their competing visions seems far in the future, but they have one thing in common: a belief that one day regular people should be able to fly their own vehicles around town. There are challenges, with both the technology and government regulations. Perhaps the biggest hurdle will be convincing the public that the whole idea isn’t crazy. “I love the idea of being able to go out into my backyard and hop into my flying car,” said Brad Templeton, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has served as a consultant on Google’s self-driving project. “I hate the idea of my next-door neighbor having one.” Early contender Kitty Hawk, the company backed by Page, is trying to be one of the first out of the gate and plans to start selling its vehicle by the end of the year. The company has attracted intense interest because of Page and its chief executive, Sebastian Thrun, an influential technologist and self-­driving car pioneer who is the founding director of Google’s X lab. In 2013, Zee Aero, a Kitty Hawk division, became the object of Silicon Valley rumors when reports of a small air taxilike vehicle first surfaced. Page declined a request for an interview but said in a statement: “We’ve all had dreams of flying effortlessly. I’m excited that one day very soon I’ll be able to climb onto my Kitty Hawk Flyer for a quick and easy personal flight.” During his recent test flight, Cameron Robertson, the aerospace engineer, used two joysticklike controls to swing the vehicle back and forth above Clear Lake. The flight, just 15 feet above the water, circled over the lake about 20 or 30 yards from shore, and after about five minutes Robertson steered back to a floating landing pad at the end of a dock. The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of several prototypes the startup, based in Mountain View, Calif., is designing. The company hopes to create an audience of enthusiasts and hobbyists, who can now pay $100 to sign up for a $2,000 discount on the retail price of a Flyer to “gain exclusive access to Kitty Hawk experiences and demonstrations where a select few will get the chance to ride the Flyer.” It is an unusual offer, since the company has not yet set a price for the vehicle, and Thrun’s and Page’s involvement can be taken as evidence that the company is aiming far beyond hobbyists. Still, Kitty Hawk is clearly targeting a new kind of transportation — air flight that can be performed safely by most people and hopefully with government approval. Federal regulation “We have been in contact with the FAA, and we see the regulators as friends,” Thrun said in an interview. He agreed that concerns about vehicles flying over our heads were legitimate. “I believe that all of us have to work together to understand how new technologies will shape the future of society, “ he said. Two years ago, Thrun recruited two other pioneers, Robertson and Todd Reichert who were aerospace engineers from AeroVelo, a University of Toronto spinoff company that won a coveted prize for a human-­powered helicopter and set the land speed record for a bicycle last year. They are flying under a special Federal Aviation Administration category for ultralight aircraft that does not require a pilot’s license and is intended for recreational flying in uncongested areas. To add an extra margin of safety, the Kitty Hawk engineers are sticking to flying over open water. The company said the final commercial product will look different and be far quieter than the test model. “We hope that this is more of an exciting concept than what most people have had in their minds about flying cars,” Robertson said. “This is not yet that product in terms of what we will say and what it can do, but I think it demonstrates a vision of the future.” Competitors Kitty Hawk could face stiff competition, not just from about a half dozen startups, but from giant Airbus, based in Blagnac, France. The aerospace firm has announced two vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, concepts and is reported to be planning an initial test flight before the end of the year. At the Geneva International Motor Show last month, Airbus proposed an autonomous vehicle named Pop. Up that would operate on both the ground and in the air. And this year, the government of Dubai, in partnership with a Chinese firm, EHang, said it planned to begin operating an autonomous flying taxi by this July. Uber is also entering the field. There is no shortage of skeptics happy to point out the roadblocks for these vehicles. There is already significant resistance to the idea of unmanned drones flying over urban areas, and flying cars could face substantial opposition, even if they can be quieted to automotive noise levels. For these personal air vehicles to become a reality in the United States, the country would need a whole new air traffic control system. Two years ago, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began development of an air traffic control system meant for managing all sorts of flying vehicles, including drones. One NASA developer described it as an air traffic control system, “for a sky dark with drones.” Researchers hope testing can begin by 2019. Batteries are also an issue. While electric propeller-­driven motors seem promising, today’s battery technology cannot support flights of a reasonable distance, say a 30- or 50-mile commute. “How is this going to work? I don’t want to be a Debbie Downer, but we can’t even take our cellphones on airplanes today because of fears about battery fires,” said Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University, who is researching personal air transport for NASA. And don’t forget that flying cars will not be able to pull to the side of the road in an emergency, said John Leonard, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. “Silicon Valley is full of very smart people, but they don’t always get the laws of physics,” he said. “Gravity is a formidable adversary.” More Business articles »     RG Business Local business news sent to your inbox every Thursday.         Today’s Business stories Business Fulfilled to the brim: Eugene hat shop owner loves his job Business Top execs at Pacific Continental receiving ‘golden parachutes’ in bank sale Business Silicon Valley vies to get flying cars off the ground National Better Wi-Fi?

Some of the most searched for questions about our county on Google We attempt to come up with answers to some of the most popular queries on the internet  Share  Comments ByAmani Hughes 08:00, 30 APR 2017 Lifestyle (Photo: Yui Mok/PA Photos)  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email It turns out people want to know a lot about Surrey - although the questions are a varied bunch. We turned to Google to find out what were the most highly searched for terms in Surrey and it proved quite enlightening. After tracking down the questions using the auto-complete function, we have attempted to answer them ourselves, replacing the use of Google entirely (ha). So take a look at the questions people have asked the most about our lovely county - we are a highly inquisitive lot! Where in Surrey... Where in Surrey do the Sacconejolys live? Your first question might actually be who on earth are the Sacconejolys and why do I care?! They are a YouTube family with millions of followers - 1.85m to be exact and vlog their daily activities everyday which are uploaded on to their Youtube channel. The family are made up of Jonathan, Anna, and their children Emelia and Eduardo and recent addition of baby number three - Alessia and of course their six Maltese dogs. Anna Saccone, Jonathan Joly, with daughter Emelia and son Eduardo (Photo: Surrey Mirror) Since starting the channel in 2009 they quit their jobs and dedicate their time to uploading daily snapshots of their lives. So the question you want to know is where do they live? The answer is Reigate! That was an easy next question! Where in Surrey is The Holiday filmed? The Holiday is one of the re-run sort of festive films that is shown every Christmas. If you've not seen it before, it focuses on two women who lead very different lives and live in entirely different places - California and rural England. Cameron Diaz filming in Shere on the set of The Holiday (Photo: Daily Mirror) Kate Winslet (Idris) and Cameron Diaz (Amanda) decide to swap houses and end up living each other's lives for a few days. It's a light hearted rom-com which features some beautiful homes and Jude Law, need I say more? The English scenes were set in idyllic Shere - a pretty village with a population of under 4,000 not too far away from Surrey. Read More On the silver screen - Surrey and Hampshire movie map There is also a scene where Amanda is shopping in a quaint deli shop on her first day to the countryside. This was in fact filmed in a candle shop in Godalming and the scene where Amanda attempts to drive her red mini in which she mounts a kerb was filmed on Church Street in the town. And the traditional pub where Amanda set her eyes on Jude Law was actually The White Horse in Shere. The White Horse in Shere where The Holiday was filmed (Photo: Google streetview) Where in Surrey is Liam Payne's house? Former One Directioner, Liam Payne, has been in the headlines recently after he and Cheryl had a baby together. The former Girls Aloud singer recently sold her Hertforshire plush pad to move in with her beau in his Surrey mansion. The star bought the reported £5.1m mansion in January 2015 and boasts a luxury outdoor swimming pool, stunning views, a tennis court, a cinema and ballet studio. Read More Cheryl is selling her £5m mansion after moving into One Direction Liam Payne's Surrey home The singer was said to have renovated the house in anticipation of the new arrival. Liam Payne and Cheryl (Photo: Getty Images Europe) However the question about where the mansion actually is remains a closely guarded secret. That said the property is fitted with camera isolation zones, many of which are heat and motion monitored, so it's safe to say you would not be allowed close to wherever the mansion is anyway. Why is... Why is Surrey so expensive? These questions are a little more vague and require a bit more thought. Such as why is Surrey so expensive? We don't claim to have the definite answer on this but it appears our readers feel the same - that they are being priced out of Surrey. Read More Has Surrey become TOO expensive?

Why is Surrey called Surrey? I'm afraid here at Get Surrey we don't have the answer to this one, I feel a learned historian might know the answer to this important question. However we will endeavour to find out where this county got it's name from... Why is Surrey so bad? We at Get Surrey would refute the suggestion that Surrey is bad, we think it's a brilliant place to live and work.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that? That Waymo, even though recently put into its own company, has not made use of that skill? Why would they not? » reply automated transport Submitted by jim (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 11:08. If you rephrase the question as "Which company is likely to profit the most from automated transportation in the next ~15 years? I would respond : Amazon I would think that automating the package delivery business is a better defined and easier problem than automating taxies. And Amazon is well on its way automating the package delivery business. I would be surprised if they don't already have a plan in place to cut the labor cost of delivering a package by a factor of 10 in the next 10 years. » reply Online retail Submitted by brad on Fri, 2017-04-07 09:40. Will indeed profit nicely, but it’s small compared to personal transportation. Delivery services around the world are a few hundred billion dollars. Personal transport is 5 trillion. » reply OEMs are the wrong segment to examine Submitted by Alison Chaiken (not verified) on Sat, 2017-04-29 22:48. The popular press always ranks automakers since the public knows their names and will buy the reports. In automotive ecosystem, this is wrong thinking. The companies that are really developing the technology are not just the Sili Valley favorites, but also Tier 1's and Tier 2's like Continental, Bosch (as you astutely point out) and Nvidia. Both Tesla and Audi run Nvidia's Tegra, making me wonder how different their systems really are. comma.ai also ran with the Nvidia Jetson board. BMW has partnered with Intel and Mobileye. Perhaps if the autonomy gold rush falters, Conti, Bosch, Harman, Nvidia and Intel will profit most. » reply Nvidia as a base Submitted by brad on Sun, 2017-04-30 02:30. Nvidia GPUs are, from this viewpoint, general purpose massively multicore processors. It’s all in the software, so there does not have to be any similarity in how Tesla and Audi and comma.ai use them. Now they are all doing neural networks with them but that’s again a platform rather than an algorithm. Tier Ones are working on it, but OEMs are scared of not owning what may become the more important tech in the car. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Though further developments are underway, Google said Thursday that it has successfully developed new deep learning algorithms that can detect and diagnose diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease which can lead to blindness, as well as locate breast cancer. Lily Peng, product manager of the medical imaging team at Google Research, shared how the US tech giant is using deep learning to train machines to analyze medical images and automatically detect pathological cues, be it swollen blood vessels in the eye or cancerous tumors, during a video conference with the South Korean media hosted by Google Korea. (123RF) Based on the workings of the human brain, deep learning uses large artificial neural networks -- layers of interconnected nodes -- that rearrange themselves as new information comes in, allowing computers to self-learn without the need for human programming. “Artificial neural networks have been around since the 1960s. But now with more powerful computing power, we can build more layers into the system to handle more complicated tasks with high accuracy,” Peng said. “In deep learning, the feature engineering is handled by the computer itself. We don’t tell the networks what the feature is, but we give them lots of examples, and have the network itself determine what these features are on their own.” On the medical front, Google has made significant progress on building an algorithm to read retinal scan images to discern signs of diabetic retinopathy, the fastest growing cause of preventable blindness in the world. Diabetic retinopathy can be detected through regular eye exams. Doctors pictures of patients’ eyes with a special camera and check for the disease based on the amount of visible hemorrhages. “Unfortunately in many parts of the world, there are not enough doctors to do this grading,” Peng said. In India, there is a shortage of 127,000 eye doctors while 45 percent of patients suffer vision loss before diagnosis,” said Peng, who is also a clinical scientist. Therefore, Google designed an AI algorithm to analyze retinal images and identify features of diabetic retinopathy. The program was exposed to 128,000 retinal images labeled by 54 ophthalmologists. Labeling took place multiple times for each image to account for diagnostic variability among doctors, it said. As the algorithm has shown high accuracy, Google has now moved to build an interface and hardware into which doctors in India can input a retinal image and immediately receive a grade for diabetic retinopathy. The firm continues to optimize its machine to improve user convenience and plans to conduct more clinical trials to secure regulatory approval, according to Peng. Lily Peng, product manager of the medical imaging team at Google Research, speaks during a video conference organized by Google Korea on Thursday. (Google Korea) Another field spearheading Google’s deep learning push is cancer detection. The tech giant is developing another deep learning algorithm that surveys biopsy images to locate metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes. “What we’re trying to do is find out where there is a little bit of breast cancer in the lymph node, which helps determine what stage of cancer the patient is in and guides treatment,” Peng said. Google’s AI algorithm achieved a tumor localization score -- how accurately it can locate the cancerous tumor -- of 0.89, exceeding the score of 0.73 from a highly-trained human pathologist with unlimited time for examination. Peng, however, pointed to the algorithm’s shortcomings in its biopsy readings. The algorithm was tested against slides containing 10,000 to 400,000 images, of which 20 to 150,000 showed tumors. Google’s algorithm located tumors with a sensitivity of 92 percent, but this was when set to allow eight false positive readings per slide. On the other hand, human doctors had a locational sensitivity of 73 percent, but zero false positives -- meaning they were less efficient at finding tumors but never identified normal tissue as a tumor. “If you combine the machine and the pathologist reading the slide, you’d have a very optimal situation where you have low false negative (diagnoses) and high sensitivity (for tumor location),” Peng said. The Google researcher said it will take some time before devices running on Google’s deep learning algorithms are commercialized for use in the medical sector, as it must secure sufficient clinical data proving their efficacy and accuracy before seeking regulatory approval. On concerns that Google’s next-generation medical image analysis tools could be subject to tougher regulations given their novelty, Peng said that the US Food and Drug Administration holds a “neutral” or “objective” approach to the devices, as they fall within an existing product category. The US FDA considers the new devices simply as upgraded versions of existing medical imaging and processing devices that can be approved as long as their claimed functions are backed by sufficient evidence, she said.

Amazon and Google could get some tough competition from Apple in the smart speaker segment. Apple is reportedly developing a smart speaker, similar to that of Amazon Echo and Google Home. The leak comes from prolific tipster Sonny Dickson. “Apple is currently finalizing designs for their Apple competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device”, Dickson said on Twitter. Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 He later added: “It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS”. Dickson told Mashable’s Jen Ryall that the smart speaker will sport a design that’s inspired by the Mac Pro, and the UE Boom’s mesh styling.  Dickson did not mention anything about a release date for the device, or a price. He believes that Apple could launch the device at this year’s WWDC. More from @SonnyDickson on Apple’s Alexa competitor. – Concave top with the controls, fat with the speaker mesh portion covering it all. 1/2 — Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017 AirPlay functionality in the upcoming in the Siri-powered speaker has been reported before, alongside a Siri DK release, notes 9to5Mac. However, the surprising part is that speaker speaker will include “Beats technology”. It’s being said that Apple might add Beat’s audio tech into its own smart speaker system. This is not the first time we’re hearing that Apple is developing a smart speaker. Back in May 2016, The Information reported that Apple could launch an “Amazon Eco-like device with a speaker and microphone built-in”. At that time, it was suggested that the device could be launched at the company’s annual WWDC. Two months later, CNET reported that Apple’s Siri-powered speaker would be able to detect the people who are in close proximity to the device using “on-board” cameras equipped with some sort of facial recognition software. In February 2017, however,  Times’s Tim Bajarin said that Apple was no longer interested in developing an intelligent speaker. Instead, Apple is “more interested in turning Siri into an omnipresent AI assistant across devices, rather than designing a single device specifically to serve as a Siri machine”. Amazon’s Echo is perhaps the most popular voice-based smart speaker on the market today. Earlier in the week, the company revealed its latest Echo device, the Echo Look that comes with a built-in camera for taking photos and recording videos. The Echo Look is pitched as a fashion tool. Amazon’s Echo devices are powered by the company’s Alexa assistant. For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple No Comments.

Owens Published: Apr 29, 2017 4:31 p.m. ET Share Head of Alphabet’s largest division made nearly $200 million in 2016, twice as much as any CEO tracked in the past two years Getty Images Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai received $199.7 million in total compensation in 2016, Alphabet reported Friday. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Alphabet Inc. awarded Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai nearly $200 million in total compensation in 2016, more than twice as much as any CEO of a publicly traded company tracked in the last two years. In its annual proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed Friday, Alphabet GOOGL, +3.71% GOOG, +3.63% revealed that Pichai was awarded $198.7 million in Alphabet stock in 2016. That is roughly double the stock Pichai received in 2015, when he was named chief executive of Google after the company reorganized as Alphabet. Don’t miss: 5 things to know about Google CEO Sundar Pichai Along with a $650,000 salary and $372,000 in recognized compensation in the form of personal security and flights, Pichai received total compensation of $199.7 million in 2016. That was nearly double his 2015 total compensation of $100.7 million. Pichai’s total compensation tops the CEO compensation packages tracked by Equilar for the past two years. In 2015, Dara Khosrowshahi of Expedia Inc. EXPE, -1.82% had the highest compensation among CEOs of publicly traded companies, at $94.6 million, according to Equilar’s annual study. Among proxy statements filed before April 1, Equilar found Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications Inc. CHTR, -1.04% was the highest-paid CEO for 2016, at more than $98 million. Pichai, though, would not show up on Equilar’s list because he is not the CEO of a publicly traded company, but rather of the Google subsidiary within Alphabet. Alphabet CEO Larry Page is the executive who would show up in Equilar’s annual study, and Page—along with fellow Google founder and Alphabet President Sergey Brin—accepted only $1 in annual salary and no stock compensation, according to the filing. Equilar spokesman Dan Marcec confirmed that Pichai was not included in the firm’s annual CEO-compensation study because of the quirks of Alphabet’s corporate structure. He said Pichai is “probably” the highest-paid top executive in the land. See also: The CEO of your company probably earns 276 times more than you do Equilar reported earlier this month that the early returns from its annual effort showed CEO pay on the rise, with median CEO compensation up 6% to $15 million and average compensation increasing from $15.5 million to $16.6 million. It is the largest increase tracked since 2013. Pichai received a $199 million equity award upon his promotion, Alphabet disclosed last year, and this year’s filing showed an additional $209 million biennial equity award issued in early 2016 that vests quarterly. The completion of the first award and beginning of the second appeared to lead to Pichai’s large total compensation for 2016. Other key Google execs fell between the Pichai and Page extremes: Diane Greene, who was hired to run Google’s cloud business late in 2015, received total compensation of $43.7 million in 2016, and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat received total compensation of slightly more than $39 million. Such large compensation awards are not unheard of among executives at large tech companies, especially when they receive big stock awards upon being hired or promoted. For instance, Tim Cook was handed a $378 million stock award when he was named CEO of Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.10% in 2011, making him the highest paid CEO that year. Last year, Cook’s total compensation took a hit, falling to $8.75 million from $10.28 million the year before, but he still has a massive cache of Apple shares. Since Google reorganized as Alphabet and made Pichai CEO of the Google division, Google stock has gained 39.1%, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.19% has risen about 14.8% over that period. The stock hit fresh record highs Friday after Alphabet beat earnings expectations, and Alphabet is the only company besides Apple with a market capitalization of more than $600 billion.

Scroll Staff Published Apr 29, 2017.   Wikimedia Commons Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai received almost $200 million (approximately Rs 1,285 crore) as a compensation package in 2016. The company attributed it to the Indian-born executive’s “numerous successful product launches”, CNN reported. A majority of the remuneration was in company stock, whose value is estimated to be around $198.7 million in securities documents. Pichai was granted the package a few months after he took over the position in 2015 from Google co-founder Larry Page, who received $1 as annual pay. Page has an estimated fortune of $41 billion. Pichai still reports to Page under the restructured management. The 44-year-old Pichai also received a $6,50,000 salary in 2016 excluding the personal security services and air travel valued provided at an estimated $3,72,000, AP reported. Google’s sales from its core advertising and YouTube business has been on the rise under Pichai’s leadership. The company has also invested in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing since he took over. We welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in.

Make your money work for you Common sense and some discipline are all you need. Published Apr 25, 2017.   Shutterstock Apr 25, 2017.   Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Dreaming of writing that book or taking that cruise when you hit your 40s? Well, this dream need not be unrealistic. All it takes is simple math and the foresight to do some smart financial planning when you are still young. If you start early and get into the discipline of cutting down on unnecessary expenditure, using that money to invest systematically, you can build wealth that sets you free to tick those items off your bucket list sooner than later. A quick look at how much you spend on indulgences will give you an idea of how much you can save and invest. For example, if you spend, say Rs. 1,000 on movie watching per week, this amount compounded over 10 years means you would have spent around Rs 7,52,000 on just movies! You can try this calculation for yourself. Think of any weekly or monthly expense you regularly make. Now use this calculator to understand how much these expenses will pile up overtime with the current rate of inflation. Now imagine how this money could have grown at the end of 10 years and overcome the inflation effect if you had instead invested a part of it somewhere! It is no rocket science The fact is that financial planning is simpler than we imagine it to be. Some simple common sense and a clear prioritization of life’s goals is all you need: Set goals and work backwards: Everything starts with what you want. So, what are your goals? Are they short-term (like buying a car), medium-term (buying a house) or long-term (comfortable living post-retirement). Most of us have goals that come under all the three categories. So, our financial plans should reflect that. Buying a house, for example, would mean saving up enough money for up-front payment and ensuring you have a regular source of income for EMI payment for a period of at least 15-20 years. Buying a car on the other hand might just involve having a steady stream of income to pay off the car loan. Save first, spend later: Many of us make the mistake of putting what is left, after all our expenses have been met, in the savings kitty. But the reverse will have more benefits in the long run. This means, putting aside a little savings, right at the beginning of the month in the investment option that works best for you. You can then use the balance to spend on your expenditures. This discipline ensures that come what may, you remain on track with your saving goals. Don’t flaunt money, but use it to create more: When you are young and get your first job, it is tempting to spend on a great lifestyle. But as we’ve discussed, even the small indulgences add up to a serious amount of cash over time. Instead, by regulating indulgences now and investing the rest of your money, you can actually become wealthy instead of just seeming to be so. Set aside emergency funds: When an emergency arises, like sudden hospitalisation or an accident, quick access to money is needed. This means keeping aside some of your money in liquid assets (accessible whenever you want it). It thus makes sense to regularly save a little towards creating this emergency fund in an investment that can be easily liquidated. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket: This is something any investment adviser will tell you, simply because different investment options come with different benefits and risks and suit different investment horizons. By investing in a variety of instruments or options, you can hedge against possible risks and also meet different goals. How and Why Mutual Funds work A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment scheme that pools money collected from investors like you and invests this into a diversified portfolio (an optimal mix) of stocks, bonds and other securities. As an investor, you buy ‘units’, under a mutual fund scheme. The value of these units (Net Asset Value) fluctuates depending on the market value of the mutual fund’s investments. So, the units can be bought or redeemed as per your needs and based on the value. As mentioned, the fund is managed by professionals who follow the market closely to make calls on where to invest money. This makes these funds a great option for someone who isn’t financially very savvy but is interested in saving up for the future. So how is a mutual fund going to help to meet your savings goals? Here’s a quick Q&A helps you understand just that: How do mutual funds meet my investment needs? Mutual Funds come with a variety of schemes that suit different goals depending on whether they are short-term, medium-term or long-term. Can I withdraw money whenever I want to? There are several mutual funds that offer liquidity – quick and easy access to your money when you want it. For example, there are liquid mutual funds which do not have any lock in period and you can invest your surplus money even for one day. Based on your goals, you can divide your money between funds with longer term or shorter term benefits. Does it help save on taxes? Investing in certain types of mutual funds also offers you tax benefits. More specifically, investing in Equity Linked Saving Schemes, which are funds that invest in a diverse portfolio of equities, offers you tax deductions up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Don’t I need a lot of money to invest in MFs? No, you can start small. The returns in terms of percentage is the same irrespective of the amount you invest in. Additionally, the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) allows you to invest a small amount weekly, monthly or quarterly in a mutual fund. So, you get to control the size and frequency of your investment and make sure you save before you spend. But aren’t MFs risky? Well many things in life are risky! Mutual funds try to mitigate your risk by investing your money across a variety of securities. You can further hedge risk by investing in 2 to 3 mutual offers that offer different growth stories i.e. a blue-chip fund and a mid-cap fund. Also remember in a mutual fund, your money is being managed by professionals who are constantly following the market. Don’t I have to wait too long to get back my returns? No! Mutual Funds, because of the variety of options they offer, can give you gains in the short or medium term too. The essence of mutual funds is that your money is not lying idle, but is dynamically invested and working for you. To know more about how investing in mutual funds really works for you, see here.

I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police!

I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently?

Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. JasonIvers Just use Cloudflare... They provide SSL, as well as DDOS protection, etc, for free. It takes basically no work, or even much knowledge, to set it up. Then, if you want to do your own later, you can, but people will be able to use https on the mean time. Artem Russakovskii We already do use Cloudflare, including their SSL, but it's not so simple with our setup for reasons I don't want to explain. We made it work on apkmirror already, and AP is coming. Jan-Lk Else What about let's encrypt? Artem Russakovskii Yup, using that too, underneath Cloudflare. The certs themselves are not the issue, it's making sure everything works on both http and https pages, including various caching we have, so there's no mixed content warning. Then once that all works, like it does on apkmirror.com, I'll force everything to https. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Da Fuq Agreed, but it's gonna be pretty expensive. New CPU, MB and DDR4 RAM. JD Still cheaper than an Intel setup. Once you consider the performance gain you can't afford to not upgrade Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers. Michael Hazell Must be nice to be able to afford expensive devices like the Pixel. I maintain my stance that there really hasn't been a successor to the OnePlus One since its inception because no future model has come to its price point.

(Reuters) SYDNEY: Alphabet Inc.’s Google said it would challenge amended tax assessments issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), which is trying to claw back billions of dollars from multinational corporations citing unpaid taxes. The ATO has increased scrutiny over how much tax multinationals operating in Australia pay. In December, it said it was pursuing seven global businesses over AU$2 billion ($1.50 billion) in unpaid tax. While the ATO has not named the businesses it is pursuing, Google’s Australia unit said in accounts filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) that it will “lodge an objection” to the tax demand from the ATO. “The company will continue to uphold its positions against any and all such claims,” Google said in the financial statement released on Friday. The search giant did not disclose how much the ATO has demanded it pay in taxes. Google and the ATO declined to comment on how much the company’s amended tax bill was. Treasurer Scott Morrison said in April the country expected to claw back AU$2.9 billion from companies under the legislation. Australia enacted the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law in December 2015 and the ATO has introduced new guidelines for foreign trading hubs. Google Australia restructured its operations effective Jan. 1 of last year to comply with the legislation and its financial statement reveals an increase in revenue and tax for the 2016 calendar year as a result. Revenue surged to AU$1.14 billion in 2016 from AU$498 million in 2015, while total income tax rose to AU$16 million from AU$2.8 million in 2015, the accounts show.

Home On Campus Alumni Athletics Campus News Greek Spotlight Features Food Tech World Entertainment Anime Comics Movies & Music Video Games Opinion Editorials Food for Thought Op-Ed About Contact Search for: HomeGeneral NewsGoogle and the Gender Pay Gap-Searching for Answers  Google and the Gender Pay Gap-Searching for Answers  April 29, 2017 Karen Ayoub General News 0 Just last week, Google was accused by the federal government for paying its female employees significantly less. The idea of a “gender pay gap” has caused much controversy over the past decade. According to Google Books’ Ngram Viewer, which shows trends in the usage of specific words or phrases in books, the usage of “gender pay gap” has steadily been increasing since 1980. Of course, this only reflects the phrase’s occurrence in books, whether in print or online. However, it does not encompass every news article, blog post, Facebook status, tweet, etc. How ironic it is that Google is the one under accusation of contributing to this gender pay gap? On Friday, April 7, a court hearing took place. In a report published by The Guardian, U.S. Department of Labor regional director, Janette Wipper, revealed the official allegations against Google: “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across [Google’s] entire workforce.” However, Google denied these statements, saying that there was no gender pay gap between their male and female employees. Eileen Naughton, Google’s Vice President of People Operations, testified regarding Google’s pay equality, citing Google’s annual salary analysis that is “extremely scientific and robust” and “gender blind.” It seems as though either Google or the feds are wrong, but could it be possible that both sides of the argument are – to an extent – true? According to an analysis by Dr. Andrew Chamberlain, the chief economist of Glassdoor, a site where employees can rate companies and management, this could actually be the case. On Glassdoor, employees self-reported their salaries, and Chamberlain examined these for Google employees. Although this data did not encompass all of Google’s employees, it served as a good sample size for the company. Chamberlain’s findings were quite interesting. According to Chamberlain’s findings, overall, Google pays women 16 percent less than it pays men. On the surface, this may seem disturbing – but that is not the entire picture. Fewer women work in high-ranking positions at Google relative to the number of men working in those positions. Chamberlain says, “In our sample of Google salaries, men and women are definitely not equally represented among job titles. For example, about 52 percent of males in our data worked as highly paid software engineers, while just 21 percent of women worked in those roles. By contrast, 6 percent of women in the sample worked as product marketing managers, while just 2 percent of men worked in those roles.” This is a concept known as “occupational segregation.” Although men and women may be paid the same across one position, just the fact that there may be more men in higher paying jobs contributes at least 54 percent to the gender pay gap according to Chamberlain’s research. In fact, this situation is not unique to Google; it is characteristic of many other technology companies. From this lawsuit, it is clear that the idea of the “gender pay gap” in America needs to be reexamined.

Search giant Google in Singapore has tied up from local running group JustRunLah! to capture photographs of popular running routes like Singapore Botanic Gardens, Mount Faber Park and MacRitchie Reservoir, among others. The group aims to cover more than 30 running routes spanning over 400km in the next few months. They plan to cover one on a “two-to-three week” basis after undergoing training sessions with the Google team, said Peter Tan, Managing Director, JustRunLah!, who also runs an online lifestyle and community site targeted at runners. As a running enthusiast himself, he hopes the project will encourage more people to lead an active lifestyle, as well as allow runners to plan their treks ahead of time. “Utimately, if you are not very familiar with the place and have not done any research, there’s a possibility you may turn a wrong one... With this project, I hope there’s the possibility of better planning. Anyone with a smartphone will see their route going forward, and if there’s any chance of getting lost, you can make your way back as well,” said Tan. Members of the group will take turns to don Google’s Street View trekker — a 20kg and 1.2m tall “wearable backpack” — as they traverse around the island’s running routes. The Street View trekker has 15 cameras mounted at the top for 360˚ panoramic imagery. Only two sets are currently available in Singapore, and one will be loaned to JustRunLah!. On Thursday, members of the group, including Tan, had their first go at the trekker while walking on the Marang trail at Mount Faber. Because of the size and weight of the equipment, individuals using the trekker have been advised not to run for safety reasons, and also to capture the images of best quality. According to Google, roughly one in five searches on their search engine are location-related, especially searches from mobile devices. More than a third of mobile queries are related to location, the company said. “We can see that location clearly matters to people, and so it’s our goal to provide the most comprehensive, accurate and easy-to-use maps and make them accessible to as many people as possible,” said Cynthia Wei, Street View Programme Manager, APAC. Users who are interested to contribute to Street View can download the app on the Google Play and iOS app store. — TODAY                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Morocco’s Christian converts emerge from the shadows India brides get wooden paddles to beat drunk husbands A sneak peek at The Met’s Rei Kawakubo exhibition (VIDEO) Tabiyo Shop: A place for designer notebooks and stationery... in Seremban! 25 years after Los Angeles riots, progress and distrust live side by side Local YouTuber asks fans to Photoshop her — and the internet responds In Muslim Indonesia, tiny Jewish community lives on China's ‘Christmas Town’ opens doors to Middle East migrants but future uncertain India's Srishti Kaur wins Miss Teen Universe From aspiring stylist to jihadist widow: One woman’s Syria story Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Iranian TV mogul shot dead in Istanbul Reuters Video: Landslide in Kyrgyzstan leaves 24 missing Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Related Articles World-first study finds that running benefits the spine, improves back pain New to running?

Skip to content To Inform is to Influence IO, SC, PD, what's in a name? Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Name and Shame, Educating the Media Fake News · Information Warfare Alt-News, Fake News, Russian Propaganda and Russian Proxy Websites Under Increased Scrutiny and Crackdown April 29, 2017 Joel Harding I read this article on RINF.com with interest, Google now threatening Alt-News web-sites.  Apparently, the crackdown on fake news is directly impacting what is also called the “Alternative News” or alt-news community. That is good news, in my opinion. One of my favorite ‘alternative’ journalists, an American working in East Ukraine, highlighted the article. “He” is published almost exclusively on those sites.  I put “he” in quotation marks because some of my Ukrainian friends believe he is a she. There is no record of his name in Ukraine. The article points out that Google is removing articles from these fake news sites. As they say in the article: “Google have an agenda.” Seeing as they’re professional journalists, it should be “Google HAS an agenda”.  But it is true, Google, Facebook, and other social media websites are aggressively removing these trash sites from the internet. In the article, there is a list of alt-news sites for me to balance against my Russian News And Russian Proxy News Sites and Conspiracy Theory Sites.  RINF is a new one, most of the rest I recognize. I believe it was Zerohedge that threw a conniption for being labeled a fake-news site last year… RINF.com washingtonsblog.com globalresearch.ca zerohedge.com sott.netoff-guardian.org strategic-culture.org countercurrents.org greanvillepost.com thepeoplesvoice.org The good news is that Google and others are aggressively policing up the crap sites which post junk on the internet. Junk, fake news, alternative news, alt-news. It’s about time. Thank you, Google and Facebook!

[Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 46 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Deals News Pixel It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016.

Middlefinger Even at $99 its not worth the bugs. It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response?

Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5.

When Facebook broadcast the horrific Thai murder of an 11-month-old baby, Natalie Jiranuch, hanged by her own father, it was a full 24 hours before the corporate giant removed the unspeakable video footage. By then it had been seen by 370,000 people, including the baby’s distraught mother, Jiranuch Trirat. Just a few days earlier, in Cleveland, Ohio, a pensioner called Robert Godwin was out collecting aluminium cans when Steve Stephens, 37, approached and shot him dead, muttering: ‘I’m about to kill this man right here, the old dude.’ This killing was put on Facebook Live – a murder which then remained visible to a supposedly civilised world for a full two hours. Mark Zuckerberg, pictured left, Google chief Eric Schmidt, pictured right, and others must be made to operate under the same tight rules and laws as newspapers, says Yasmin Alibhai-Brown And how did Facebook respond to these snuff videos and the torrent of justified criticism? By asking the rest of us, effectively, to do their job for them. ‘We are reviewing flows to make sure people can report videos and other materials that violate our standards as easily and quickly as possible,’ said a spokesman. ‘We know we need to do better.’ It does not take a tech expert to know that this was corporate bilge. The big beasts of new media believe they are untouchable and unaccountable. And this has to change. There is little that could match the brutality of these two on-line killings, yet they belong in a cesspit of appalling material that is freely available online. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Yes, minister… I AM surfing the net! Civil servants are... Facebook, Twitter and Google bosses will face personal fines... Share this article Share At its terrible worst it means terrorist slaughter, the torture of disabled people and young women, gang rapes, violent porn, child abuse, suicide and self-harm sites. Easily accessed, they are desensitising people, coarsening cultures, distorting values. Google lost millions of pounds last month when major companies pulled their advertising because their products were being promoted next to extremist YouTube videos. On that occasion, Google did act, and fast. Money counts, it seems. People do not. But online abuse is not confined to a world of murderous outrages. Instead it has seeped into an everyday existence in which trolls, for example, are free to be as intimidating and malicious as they please. Companies like Facebook, pictured, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, project themselves as the slick makers of a brave new world where old rules like financial and social integrity are passé (stock photo) Women and people of colour are viciously targeted. A friend of mine, a female Muslim local councillor, tried to kill herself after a particularly nasty week. In this virtual world there is no limit to the aggression hiding beneath a cloak of digital anonymity. Of course we cannot blame Twitter, Facebook or Google for everything. Degrading online material is a new, unprecedented problem that affects the internet as a whole. But the leading figures of the industry bear a particular responsibility. The men who took us into the jungle do nothing to civilize the space – even though it is they who make the billions of pounds and dollars. Perhaps it is their very novelty which allows them to get away with it. Companies like Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, project themselves as the slick makers of a brave new world where old rules like financial and social integrity are passé. I have been to both Google and Facebook premises in London. When you enter, it is like passing the toughest border control, but once inside, you can only be impressed. These are delightful, intellectual playgrounds with hammocks, roof gardens and fabulous restaurants. It’s the strangest combination of secrecy and transparency, conformity and blue-sky thinking. And yes, these new corporations can be a force for good. The internet is an indispensable part of modern life. It has fast become as vital as fire, light, water and air. But those services, remember, are under some kind of state supervision. Google, pictured, lost millions of pounds last month when major companies pulled their advertising because their products were being promoted next to extremist YouTube videos (stock photo) Not so the controllers of the new, essential utility. They are lawless, hubristic, all powerful with businesses more profitable than any other sector has been through history. The most successful oil firms earn but hundreds of millions; Google, Facebook et al make billions. This is why the reprehensibly cold, nihilistic enterprises have put themselves above all laws, tax regimes and regulation. They are destroying government revenues and wilfully undermine democracies. Because they can. In his excellent report, Tech Giants And Civic Power, Martin Moore of King’s College, London, expresses grave concern at the erosion of citizen rights as ungovernable internet companies take over the universe. Yes, the internet can be an effective political tool for citizens who wish to hold the authorities to account – in some circumstances. But remember this, too. Around the world, the internet is as likely to be used by governments to misinform or spy. In many respects, the internet wields the power of a broadcasting system – but one without controls. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown says visiting the Google offices in London is 'like passing the toughest border control'. Pictured is the company's chief executive Eric Schmidt speaking in Hertfordshire in 2013 The most successful oil firms earn but hundreds of millions; Facebook et al make billions. Pictured is the social network's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg speaking at a conference in the US state of California earlier this month Truth itself and basic decency too have been corrupted by the tech companies. Now the carriers of fake news want to ‘educate’ users so they can spot the lies and fabrications. Its just another planned, cynical, change-nothing strategy. Professor Gabriel Kahn, of the University of South California, warned last year that: ‘Facebook and Google are essentially polluting an information ecosystem with trash, with garbage, and it is clear that garbage has an impact.’ This is everywhere. The internet is affecting impressionable people, children in particular. It is normalising sexual violence, encouraging discrimination and distorting elections. The big operators now own and manipulate nations, communities and families. They do so without any sense of social, economic, political or democratic responsibility. Zuckerberg, Google chief Eric Schmidt and others must be made to operate under the same tight rules and laws as newspapers and the traditional broadcast media. The internet giants have got away with too much for too long and have been contemptuous of fairness, accuracy, redress and consumer care – all the principles of good journalism. Businesses which advertise on these sites must exert moral pressure too and more importantly, governments and international agencies must act to tame the cabal which has become a far bigger danger to humanity than any global conflict or megalomaniac leader.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 34 shares Most watched News videos Comedian Hassan Minhaj roasts Trump administration at WHCD Man rescues cat after it slips and falls into London's Docks Charlie Watkins' Take Me Out date filmed shortly before his death Shocking video emerges of Delta Airlines pilot HITTING passenger Dr Phil: Caught of tape!

What We Use, 2017 Edition: The stuff Corbin can't live without Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/28 8:26am PDTApr 28, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 21 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares75 Features What We Use Series Article Contents 1 Hardware 1.0.1 Phone: Google Pixel 1.0.2 Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 1.0.3 Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' 1.0.4 Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') 1.0.5 Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) 1.0.6 Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 1.0.7 Smart speaker: Google Home 1.0.8 Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE 1.0.9 Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 1.0.10 Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock 2 Software 2.0.1 Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) 2.0.2 Signal Spy (Android) 2.0.3 InputMapper (Windows) 2.0.4 Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) 3 Conclusion You may recall Android Police's long-running 'What We Use' series, where the fantastic people that work here share the tech (and sometimes non-tech) products they use on a frequent basis. I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police!

It looks fantastic :) Corbin Davenport Gladly! http://www.ebay.com/itm/First-Order-Trooper-vinyl-decal-sticker-STAR-WARS-Force-Awakens-/171760424579 EcE Any particular reason your smartwatches stopped working? I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently? Corbin Davenport I'm still using the Developer Preview on it, since I don't think the final 2.0 release has been pushed to it yet. I don't really use Assistant on it, though. Orlando aka Pixel XL I have surface pro 4 connected to dock station with two monitors. LG watch sport and pixel XL/Samsung Galaxy S8+ How is that programming application? I use pycharm and enthought canopy which r awful! Corbin Davenport You mean Sublime Text? Like I said in the post, it's great. Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. JasonIvers Just use Cloudflare... They provide SSL, as well as DDOS protection, etc, for free. It takes basically no work, or even much knowledge, to set it up. Then, if you want to do your own later, you can, but people will be able to use https on the mean time. Artem Russakovskii We already do use Cloudflare, including their SSL, but it's not so simple with our setup for reasons I don't want to explain. We made it work on apkmirror already, and AP is coming. Jan-Lk Else What about let's encrypt? Artem Russakovskii Yup, using that too, underneath Cloudflare. The certs themselves are not the issue, it's making sure everything works on both http and https pages, including various caching we have, so there's no mixed content warning. Then once that all works, like it does on apkmirror.com, I'll force everything to https. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Da Fuq Agreed, but it's gonna be pretty expensive. New CPU, MB and DDR4 RAM. JD Still cheaper than an Intel setup. Once you consider the performance gain you can't afford to not upgrade Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers. Michael Hazell Must be nice to be able to afford expensive devices like the Pixel. I maintain my stance that there really hasn't been a successor to the OnePlus One since its inception because no future model has come to its price point.

Amazon Tap firmware update enables Echo-style hands free voice commands Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2017/02/09 6:03pm PDTFeb 9, 2017 6 Plus 1 on G+ 52 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares113 Accessories Amazon Here's an interesting example of a product getting better with age. The Amazon Tap speaker was introduced as a mobile, battery-powered alternative to the Echo, with access to the same Alexa voice commands, but limited in that it could only accept said commands with a button press. This made the less-expensive Tap, while interesting, not all that much better than a smartphone for voice searches. But the latest firmware update from Amazon enables hands-free Alexa commands, like the Echo and Google's Assistant on the Google Home. Talk about a value add. The new update can be downloaded and applied via the Amazon Alexa Android app. Once installed, the always-on voice feature can be turned on via the app whenever the speaker has a Wi-Fi connection available. The Tap should last for about 8 hours on a full charge even while always listening, and it can be put to sleep with a single button press when you're done with it. The new update actually makes the Amazon Tap something of a misnomer - tapping is no longer required. This new feature makes the Tap functionally identical to the Echo (albeit without some of the larger device's fancy omni-directional speaker tech) at a $50 discount and a much smaller form factor. For that matter, the $130 Amazon Tap is the same price as the Google Home, and comes with untethered battery use, too. Considering how much of a head start Amazon has on Google in the voice assistant gadget category, the new update can be seen as a savvy strike at the competition.

Although I just found out it had this shortcoming since I don't own any. The smart thing would have been to enable always listening while charging and button activation when on battery. Either way, I invested in the Google Home. Just a smarter investment into the real Android Ecosystem. Schmaltzy Not really. 64bitprocessor Apple would never add a feature improvement such as this in any of their devices, they would claim the hardware is not capable (siri + iPhone 4/s, cough). Google could do the same for Nexus by giving them Assistant too. Nice unexpected update, thanks Amazon. Grayson Well Apple did add Siri voice assistant to my 2013 and 2015 MacBook Pros last year.... sooo.... Mariatklein Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Grayson ? Does Google have a voice assistant on Chromebooks? If so, how long did it take them? Matt Now I'm not sure whether to go for an Amazon dot/echo or wait for Google Home to come to the UK. bekifft Wait for Google Home version 2.0 to launch with better microphones. YaKillaCJ This will be when I get another. Although by then it may not be needed since it's coming to AndroidTV. That and Google Assistant (for Home) features are being added into the Google Assistant (for Pixel aka phones). But yea, more mics and higher volume speakers would be nice. Not that the speakers are bad, in fact the sound quality is great, just wish it was louder. Another upgrade would be an aux out (3.5mm/TosLink) jack found on the Chromecast Audio would be nice. Willie Chalmers III I'd say Google has about six months before they really lose their foothold into the voice assistant space if they don't act quickly. I'll admit, Google does have a different strategy for its assistant, but they really need to bring it to more devices to compete with Alexa, the household name for voice assistants. I really hope they bring it to all devices by the end of this year or when Pixel 2 comes out. On Amazon doing this: I think it's great that they're able to maintain their profitability while having competitors' functionality. JW Let's see. The tap is less expensive, have battery to use anywhere, and more portable. Why would anyone buy the echo? Just for the slightly better speaker? CRA21K Echo has 7 microphones, which result in accurate voice detection. ericshmerick Yah, spec war won, but I've never had an issue with the Tap's mic(s?) Unless you scream across the house at your Echo, the Tap is now a great buy for versatility. CRA21K Its about far field recognition, which I mean t not the spec war. If the tap mic works across the room when I call alexa then that should be fine. Ajmobileguru you might as well use the Echo Dot. Works all the time unless you have a loudspeaker blaring in front of it. The echo series of products has a long way to go and can definitely become a lot smarter like answering more types of questions.Google assistant and home win big time in answering questions and contextual awareness. Todd Far from slightly better speaker. My echo sounds fantastic in our open floorplan living room kitchen area, the Tap sounds great in a single room, but isn't nearly as full sounding in larger rooms. bekifft I find the Echo hears me better (the dot and the full size, haven't tried the tap) but Google Home actually gets the result I wanted more often when it does hear me. I wish it had the omnidirectional microphones, that would help a lot. Still prefer Google Home to Echo, though Google Home is a terrible name. Google must have inherited from Microsoft its terrible naming habits. floydmaster I've had the same impression. My Echo is much better at consistently hearing me, but Home is usually offers better results. The big advantage the Home has for me right now is the ability to play videos through my Chromecast. I also like the news summaries offered by the Home better. The Echo seems to be much better hardware, though. steb0ne Amazon it seems is trying hard to not let Google Home take market share in this space or something... that it's kinda harming itself adding features like this to this will hurt Echo sells IMO. SN: I never had a problem with Home hearing me but maybe it's cuz I live in an apartment, lol! Wes Not really, The Echo has its own benefits such as better audio and looks better. I think Amazon has done a good job delineating a clear product line. I have a Dot and a Tap. Use both and I would have gotten an Echo but we really wanted a portable device that could be taken around the house. ericshmerick Well then, I may have a use for it now. Having to press the button made me toss it in a drawer. Now it may live on my nightstand... Smartass #NotMyPissPres! Finally! Rob Cook My Tap just got a hell of a lot more useful! deepdvd You actually got the update? Mine doesn't seem to want to. Rob Cook No, speaking for when it arrives, still waiting... deepdvd Okay, let me fix that... "My Tap will get a hell of a lot more useful!" Rob Cook Got it, yesterday. Works like a charm, just have to flip a button in the settings to enable the 'always on' voice detection. Now I can confidently say my Tap is a hell of a lot more useful ;) Schmaltzy Did you finally get the update? I was just informed by Amazon that some Taps won't auto-update immediately and could take 1 or 2 days after you set up the device. If that doesn't happen, contact Amazon customer service and speak with tech support. Just received my Tap and it's got software from March, 2016. deepdvd Yeah, I got it. It just took what seemed forever. deepdvd Is there a way to force an update? Schmaltzy Note: the Amazon Tap may not have have the hands-free option software update when you receive it and apparently, that update cannot be forced. Amazon support said I should keep it plugged in for 48 hours (so it doesn't run out of juice while receiving update). He said within that time frame it should auto-update but if not, to call Amazon C.S. back and speak with technical support. Sami Ahmed How do you update the firmware on your tap? I cannot find it anywhere in the apple alexa app Follow Android Police 1.49M 466k 142k 112k Latest Deals 11 [Deal Alert] New dual-sim international unlocked Galaxy S8 (G950FD) on eBay, $730 for Exynos and $820 for Qualcomm 2017/04/29 3:02pm PDTApr 29, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Get a refurbished unlocked T-Mobile Galaxy S7 (SM-G930T) for $279.99 on eBay 2017/04/29 1:10pm PDTApr 29, 2017 14 [Deal Alert] Get the new BLU R1 Plus for just $109.99 ($50 off) as part of Amazon's Deal of the Day 2017/04/29 7:36am PDTApr 29, 2017 14 [Deal Alert] Ecobee3 thermostat is now just $176.16 at Amazon ($72 off) 2017/04/28 5:58pm PDTApr 28, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Get your weekend started with 18 temporarily free and 23 on-sale apps 2017/04/28 2:21pm PDTApr 28, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

You likely have accounts at forums you haven't been to in a decade, and social media services so bereft of users they resemble graveyards. And each and every one of those accounts is a potential avenue into your private life for a hacker. So you need to secure them. These are some of the best ways to keep those accounts secure — and they're all quick and simple to do, so you've got no excuses. 1) Close the accounts you're not using Image: Screenshot Here's what happens to your old, unused accounts on the web: They get hacked. And sometimes they lead the way to the more valuable accounts that you really do care about, so it makes sense to keep the number of accounts you're using down to a minimum. As an added bonus it means you've got fewer usernames and passwords to worry about. 2) Set up a password manager Speaking of usernames and passwords, there are apps that can help out here. Not only do password managers like 1Password or LastPass manage all of your various login credentials for you, they can also generate ultra-secure passwords, saving you from having to remember lots of different ones or resorting to using the same one for everything. 3) Add two-factor verification We've been banging the two-factor verification drum for a while now, and you can set it up on most online accounts, including ones for Apple, Google and Microsoft. It means even if someone gets ahold of your username and password, they won't be able to log into your account on a new device without an extra code delivered over SMS or through an app. Which means they will need physical access to your devices. 4) Protect your password resets Image: Screenshot How easy is it for someone to reset your passwords? If one of your email addresses gets compromised, your social networks could be next, but there are ways to stop this — like checking the Require personal information to reset my password tickbox in Settings on Twitter (under the Account tab), and ensuring your "secret questions" are strong ones. 5) Check your account activity Many of your online accounts let you check up on recent activity — you can head to this page for Facebook and this page for Google, for example — and it's worth doing this regularly to make sure nothing seems amiss. You can typically log out of all sessions but the current one, and revoke account authorizations for any devices you don't recognise. 6) Delete third-party account connections There's nothing inherently wrong with letting other apps and services connect to your Facebook and Twitter, but you should keep these connections to a minimum and remove any you're not using, to block off any potential avenues for hackers to use. You can easily manage your connected apps online for your Google, Twitter and Facebook accounts. 7) Keep your software updated Image: Screenshot Many a vulnerability comes through outdated software, so you should always make sure your operating systems and browsers are right up to date to keep your computer secure and by extension the online accounts you access through them. Thankfully, most software packages now auto-update seamlessly enough, so it's not difficult to stay up to date. 8) Trust no one You'll hear this mantra a lot if you watch X-Files, and it's one you should repeat to yourself whenever you receive an email or social media message with dubious contents. Beware of following links without any context and be aware that phishing scams continue to get smarter and trickier to spot. Think before you click and read up on the latest threats. 9) Get extra help Unless you install something really sketchy and terrible, antivirus programs and other bits of security software can't do any harm and may well do a lot of good — like guarding against the phishing attacks we've just mentioned. There are plenty of good free and paid-for security packages out there for whatever devices you happen to be using. 10) Specify your trusted contacts Image: Screenshot If someone should boot you out of your Facebook account, you can get your friends to let you back in, as long as you tell Facebook who you trust beforehand — go to Security in Settings to set this up. It's simple but effective: Facebook sends your friends one-off codes you can use to regain access, codes which they're told to only pass on to you. 11) Change your passwords regularly If you've got a password manager set up (see above) then this might be taken care of for you but whatever your situation you should be changing your passwords on a regular basis, and we do mean all of them. You've then got much less to worry about should a big batch of them become available to hackers, because you'll likely have changed yours. 12) Use a secret email address If someone knows your email address, they're halfway to knowing how to log into your accounts — and these days it's not that difficult to find out someone's email address. Setting up a private email address (that doesn't really relate to your name) solely for logging into your social media accounts is another way of keeping them more secure. 13) Do you know where your phone is? Image: Screenshot Our mobile phones are gateways to many an online account so you need to keep them well protected. That involves both setting up remote wipe capabilities for if your device gets lost (see the instructions for iOS and Android), and making sure your devices are completely and securely wiped should you be selling them or passing them on. 14) Stay informed One of the easiest but most effective ways of keeping your accounts secure is just to keep up with the tech news — something we can help with. If you know about the latest threats and breaches, and how to deal with them, you won't be caught out. Of course, keeping your active accounts down to a minimum (see the first point) is going to help here too. 15) Install a VPN We've written before about staying safe on public Wi-Fi and if you spend a lot of time in coffee shops or at hotels then the investment in a solid VPN application is well worth it. As well as letting you spoof your location if you need to, it also adds an extra layer of security to the data you're sending and receiving, making it harder for anyone else to listen in. 16) Add PIN code protection Image: Wachiwit/Shutterstock.com A PIN code or password login on your phone or laptop is all that stands in the way of passing strangers and your online accounts, so make sure there's one in place. Whether your devices offer password protection, or fingerprint ID sensing, or facial recognition, or iris scanning, make sure there's something there that stops other people from logging in. 17) Keep your accounts to yourself On a related note, it's well worth setting up your own account on your computer or your browser or your tablet to keep other people away from your important accounts. We're not saying your toddler or your housemate is actively trying to hack into your Facebook but from a security perspective it's always best to limit access as much as possible. 18) Watch what you share online Your accounts are only as secure as the weakest links protecting them — and those links often involve someone impersonating you. Make sure personal details that can be used to verify your identity, like your home address, your birthday, or even what soccer team you support (is that your "secret security question"?) aren't all over your social media profiles.

Campbell Simpson 01 May 2017 10:30 AM The Samsung Galaxy S8 is Samsung's first big phone launch after last year's Note7 disaster. It's a huge moment for the world's most popular smartphone manufacturer. For a lot of everyday smartphone buyers - the talkback radio listeners and tabloid newspaper readers of the world - Samsung is a tarnished name. The Galaxy S8 is the first, and potentially only, chance for the company to change that opinion. Here's how it fared during our in-depth testing. Why The Police's Metadata Screw Up Changes Everything Anthony Caruana 01 May 2017 12:30 PM Late last week, the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police revealed that an officer has accessed the personal metadata of an Australian journalist as part of an investigation into that reporter’s sources for a story about the AFP. While Commissioner Colvin put it down to "human error” there is far more to this. What we have seen in this specific case is a complete breakdown of the protections we deserve as private citizens.

If you've looked at TestFlight before, now might be the time to rethink it. by Alex Curylo · May. 01, 17 · Mobile Zone Free Resource Like (0) Comment (0) Save Tweet {{ articles[0].views | formatCount}} Views Edit Delete {{ articles[0].isLocked ?

This looks pretty interesting: Well doesn’t that just sort a whole lot of issues we routinely run into, am I right? Sure we can play games with app IDs and icon tagging and whatever, not even going to bother linking to our various posts on tips and tricks for that kind of thing, but this looks waaay easier. Mind you, we haven’t actually distributed an app using Apple’s incarnation of TestFlight yet- next one’ll be the first. When they first acquired it the "no iOS 7" thing was a flat out dealbreaker, and by the time that wasn’t well we’d settled into a Crashlytics-centered flow nicely so eh, whatever dudes. The first time it crossed our mind that, "hmmm...maybe we could rethink that," was this post last fall: How Not to Crash #1. Interestingly, these crashes did not appear in our usual crash reporting service, HockeyApp, so it actually took us a while to realize that we had a problem. To be aware of all crashes, developers need to check for crash reports through iTunes Connect, or Xcode too… Well, if we have to check them there, why bother checking other places too? Always like to streamline our process, being awesome DevOps dudes and all. But that wasn’t enough to seriously consider going all in, until a few weeks ago Google gobbled as Google gobbles and we were a tad miffed, you might recall. Clearly this is great if you’ve already bought into the Firebase platform, but if you haven’t, there’s a bit of thinking to do now, especially for those of us in businesses that Google actively competes with, so we have a smidgen of trepidation about handing over our collective user profiles and activity. Paranoid, yes yes, but hey- paranoids have enemies too. So that was enough to prod us into actively researching alternatives. In our considered opinion Bugsee is the best out there right now by a spectacular margin, oooh network logs would rock! But oh, come on dudes, we’re an indie place here (OK, actually these days we’re DevOps at Agoda.com because Bangkok!) You actually think we can pay? Heh, that’s cute. And yes yes, Dear Reader, your favorite is very nice too, but nothing else really struck us as worth the effort to switch to. But this. This here, this actively solves recurring problems! And far as we’re aware — please correct us if we’re wrong — the only actual downside from a dev perspective remaining with TestFlight is that users can opt out of reporting, and then no doubt those that choose to are the exact ones that would get that one weird crash we’d get grumpies 1-starring us with no way to figure out WTF they’re going on about, which would be … suboptimal. But, oh wait, that problem’s sorted now too, so … what’s left as a practical objection to going all in on TestFlight for your iOS platform needs? Why, nothing we can see! If there’s anything we’ve still overlooked, please comment, but at first glance, our verdict is "yep, next project, no Google libs, all in Apple." We’ll update here if any flaws arise in that cunning plan! Learn how divergent branches can appear in your repository and how to better understand why they are called “branches".  Brought to you in partnership with Wakanda.  Like This Article?

A hard-hitting report accused major firms of putting more effort into protecting their profits than keeping the public safe online. Ministers should consider forcing firms to pay for the cost of policing on social media and introducing a system of sanctions with multimillion-pound fines, the Home Affairs Select Committee said. Labour chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: “Social media companies’ failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace. “They have been asked repeatedly to come up with better systems to remove illegal material such as terrorist recruitment or online child abuse. Yet repeatedly, they have failed to do so. It is shameful.” The cross-party committee, which took evidence from Google, Facebook and Twitter, acknowledged that the technology giants had considered the impact that online hate, abuse and extremism can have on individuals and welcomed measures taken to tackle the problem. But they said “nowhere near enough is being done”. The committee said it had found “repeated examples of social media companies failing to remove illegal content when asked to do so”, including “dangerous” terrorist recruitment material, promotion of sexual abuse of children and incitement to racial hatred. The report said: “The biggest companies have been repeatedly urged by Governments, police forces, community leaders and the public to clean up their act, and to respond quickly and proactively to identify and remove illegal content. They have repeatedly failed to do so. “That should not be accepted any longer. Social media is too important to everyone - to communities, individuals, the economy and public life - to continue with such a lax approach to dangerous content that can wreck lives. “And the major social media companies are big enough, rich enough and clever enough to sort this problem out - as they have proved they can do in relation to advertising or copyright. “It is shameful that they have failed to use the same ingenuity to protect public safety and abide by the law as they have to protect their own income.” In their strongly-worded report, the MPs accused Google, which owns YouTube, of making money from hatred because adverts appear alongside “inappropriate and unacceptable content, some of which were created by terrorist organisations” - with the creators of the extreme content also getting a share of the revenue. Although some advertisers had withdrawn their business from the site and Google may suffer financially as a result, “the most salient fact is that one of the world’s largest companies has profited from hatred and has allowed itself to be a platform from which extremists have generated revenue”. The MPs said it was “unacceptable” that social media companies relied on users to report content, claiming the firms were “outsourcing” the role “at zero expense” while expecting the police to bear the costs of keeping their platforms and reputations “clean of extremism”. MPs suggested considering “meaningful fines” for social media companies which fail to remove illegal content within a strict timeframe, highlighting proposals in Germany which could see firms fined up to £44m. And they suggested a similar model to that used in football, where clubs are obliged to pay for policing around their stadiums on match days, urging ministers to consult on requiring social media firms to contribute to the cost of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism internet referral unit.

In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against “two US-based internet companies” that were not named at the time. They had allegedly been tricked into wiring more than $100m to the alleged scammer’s bank accounts. On 27 April, Fortune reported that the two victims were Facebook and Google. The man accused of being behind the scam, Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, allegedly posed as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the companies from at least 2013 until 2015. “Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company,” the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in March 2017-05-01 The Citizen tweet Previous: Police arrest ex-Jigawa governor, Sule Lamido Next: May Day celebrations: Gov.

Your traffic is less than impressive, your Facebook shares get a measly six likes and you’re certainly not seeing any leads come out of it.  Here are some potential reasons why that might be the case and some tips on how to turn it around. 1. You’re bland and have no voice Your blog needs to be engaging. Take a bold stance. Be intentional (and consistent) about your tone and voice. Be unique in the way you write your content, so that you stand out from the crowd.  2. You’re not adding value Don’t devote your blog to talking about yourself and selling your products. Help your audience solve a problem. Give them advice and link to other helpful resources. Leave them with actionable insights that they can quickly implement.  3. No one cares about your topic Just because you think your topics are cool doesn’t mean your audience does. Listen to them during phone calls and meetings, stalk them on social media and use Google’s tools to see what your audience is actually searching for.   4. The content is either too elementary or too aggressive Balance is key. If you’re spitting out 101 rhetoric every week, they’ll immediately sniff that out and take off. On the other hand, if you head down rabbit holes or make your readers feel like idiots, they’ll still do that. Again, be mindful of your audience. Figure out what their knowledge is on the subject, and talk about it at a level that makes sense for them.  5. You’re not timely enough If you’re finally getting to that blog post on United Airlines, don’t bother — unless you have valid backing and reasoning for your fresh eyes on the topic. With social media today, people move quickly. News is hot for about a minute, until everyone moves on to the latest fuck up.  6. It’s not optimized for SEO Let me first reinforce tip 3: make sure you’re writing about what people are looking for. If you’re writing about something that no one cares about, then no one is going to be searching for it on Google, and you’re missing out on all of that free traffic.  But it takes more than a newsworthy topic. You need to write the post with SEO in mind. Make the post scannable using headings, sub-headings and bullet points. Find ways to integrate those primary keywords into your blog in a logical manner.  7. You’re not promoting it enough Sharing the link once on your Facebook page isn’t going to cut it. Leverage email newsletters, all of your social channels, the homepage of your website and most importantly, your staff. Also, don’t assume that your content is done after you do all of this. Re-purpose those blogs down the road to make the most of them.  8. You’re not converting the visitors that you do manage to capture and engage You can drive millions of people to your website, but if you’re not doing anything to engage and capture them while they’re there, you’re wasting your efforts. Include strong call-to-actions, lead-generation forms and links to other pages on your site to engage your audience and keep them coming back for more. Blogs are a great tool for generating content and building thought leadership, but you need to be intentional and strategic if you’re going to see the results you’re looking for.

Masa, as he is popularly known, had poached India-born Arora at the time and was in the midst of reinventing his organisation. SoftBank 2.0 is what the project was called, the vision was to make the group more global and take bets on technology startups. India was one such market the sprawling technology group was eyeing, and Arora was the man to take Masa's plan to fruition.On his India trip almost three years back, Arora met Kunal Bahl, the founder and CEO of Snapdeal, an online marketplace which Masa was keen to invest in. At the time Snapdeal was competing with Flipkart in India's hot e-commerce market which was about $6 billion in size. Arora convinced Bahl to agree to take SoftBank's money by offering a slightly better valuation.October 2014, marked the arrival of SoftBank as Snapdeal's largest investor as it led a $627-million financing round valuing the online marketplace at $1.2 billion and got itself a 33% stake in the company . Bahl and his co founder Rohit Bansal grew up in Delhi as school friends, went through multiple pivots (a startup jargon which means the change of a company's business model) since they began in 2007. In its latest avatar, Snapdeal wanted to be the Alibaba of India. Having backed the Chinese internet giant in its infancy, and having gained unprecedented returns after the much-ballyhooed Alibaba IPO, SoftBank's bet on Snapdeal wasn't surprising at the time. Just a few months before Snapdeal's funding round was announced another seminal event had unfolded at the Bengaluru-based Flipkart which racked up $1 billion from a clutch of investors, valued at $7 billion. The e-commerce sweepstakes were only starting to play out with such an enormous and never-seen-before slug of capital chasing the Indian online retail story. Snapdeal's Rise Between 2014-15 After raising its largest financing round, Snapdeal started pushing the pedal. It wanted to compete head on with Flipkart, the country's largest online retailer which was growing on the back of massive smartphone sales. Gross merchandise value -or GMV ,a proxy indicator for growth in the e-commerce sector -was gaining currency rapidly and was being used to burnish the valuations of these companies. The Seattle-based online behemoth Amazon, which so far had been testing the India market, decided to throw down the gauntlet. In September 2014, its visionary founder Jeff Bezos famously stood on a truck outside the company's Bengaluru headquarters along with his India chief Amit Agarwal, waving a $2-billion cheque. From here on, the Indian ecommerce story started to change. Snapdeal reported a 301% jump in GMV for the year ended March 2015, according to documents put up by SoftBank during its earnings results. Between 2014 to 2015, the Indian e-commerce market almost doubled from $6 billion to $11.5 billion as discounting peaked. Still the No. 2 player, Snapdeal went on to successfully raise more money on the back of its growth. 2015: Tencent Turned Down, Alibaba Comes In When Snapdeal was racing ahead on the GMV front, Alibaba's arch rival, China's Tencent, expressed interest in the company. The internet major had offered to put $350 million at a $5-billion valuation, people privy to the talks said.We found out from sources that SoftBank wasn't keen on having Tencent on board and pushed for an Alibaba entry into Snapdeal.In the meantime, the web retailer went out and snagged the mobile wallet startup Freecharge in a $400-million deal, largely done through a share-swap to build its payments business. Then in August 2015, the e-tailer closed a fresh financing round of $500 million with Alibaba and Foxconn, valuing it at $4.8 billion. Tencent was ke pt out. Significantly enough, last month, the internet behemoth behind WeChat messenger invested in Flipkart. 2016: From GMV Race To Turning Profitable Snapdeal's revenue growth started to slow down sharply from 450% for the year ending March 2015 to 56% at Rs 1,457 crore a year later. Amazon was weaning away market share while Flipkart was stagnating. The overall industry had become sluggish, GMV numbers were flat for the industry at $11-12 billion. Now, Snapdeal had begun talking down GMV . Instead, it wanted to draw up a path to profitability -Bahl had been quoted as saying this publicly. Even as the change in strategy was starting to play out, Snapdeal got some more funds, this time from one of the world's largest pension funds,Ontario Teachers Pension Plan at a $6.5 billion valuation. The new investor had bought $150 million of secondary shares from Snapdeal's early investors and put $50 million into the company. By the middle of 2016, the e-tailer changed tack completely and figured fighting the war chest of Amazon wouldn't be easy, but the sudden news of Arora's departure in June last year from SoftBank was going to alter Snapdeal's future. The Nikesh Arora Factor We'd met Arora at SoftBank's Silicon Valley office a few days after he'd resigned. He'd said the Indian companies SoftBank had funded during his tenure will find support from Masa. But the Indian e-commerce sector had changed, he'd admitted. "In the last two years, what has happened is that Jeff Bezos (Amazon founder) has come out and said he wants to win India at all cost. He will spend billions of dollars in India and that's a new competitive fact. You have to figure out a way to compete with that. The question is does it become like an Alibaba JD, a two-player China market, or a multi-player market? That depends on execution," he said. Arora was of the view that Snapdeal was moving from negative to positive gross margins. "I know Snapdeal has started focusing on profitable GMV instead of just GMV ," he had said then. Nikesh Arora's moving out of SoftBank was a big blow for Snapdeal A person close to the company said, "His ( Arora) moving out of SoftBank was a big blow for Bahl and Snapdeal. The present team is trying to obliterate his legacy and his investment calls were being questioned. This is why SoftBank asked Snapdeal to chase growth, the opposite of what Arora was telling the company to do." After Arora, who was anointed by Masa as his successor, departed, others in his team like Deep Nishar, Kabir Misra (who's now on the Snapdeal board) and Alok Sama began actively liaising with the Indian e-commerce company . Masa also stepped in. He was now keeping himself abreast with what was going on at one of his earliest bets on India internet. While Arora was still around, he along with the Snapdeal founders had strung together a $350-mil lion financing from existing investor eBbay, which would have valued the e-commerce company at $6.5 billion, sources said. This deal would have involved folding up eBay india into Snapdeal. But this didn't come through. Last month, eBay India, which now has only 4-5% holding in Snapdeal, invested in Flipkart, and sold its local unit in the process. We'd reached out to Snapdeal and SoftBank spokespersons through an emailed questionnaire on the events leading up to the current situation which did not elicit a response. Sale To Alibaba Falls Through After Arora's exit, SoftBank started to press for a sale to Alibaba. People who were privy to the goings-on said SoftBank wanted to merge Snapdeal with Paytm's e-commerce marketplace and Freecharge with Paytm's payments play. This is when Snapdeal made another so-called pivot with a Rs 200 crore brand relaunch targeting smaller town customers. While the discussions were on in full swing, the Jack Ma-led Alibaba didn't agree to the final deal, and after Diwali spends, Snapdeal found itself staring at its fast depleting cash reserves. Alibaba and its subsidiary Alipay are investors in Paytm. Foxconn, Paypal Bid For Freecharge Stake Even as SoftBank was trying to pull off the Alibaba Snapdeal transaction, Freecharge, which had been scouting for funds since 2015, was closing in on a deal with Foxconn sometime around July last year. The Taiwanese manufacturer of Apple iPhones was ready to pump in $300 million, valuing Freecharge at around $800 million. SoftBank was willing to participate with half of that sum, but the deal never closed.Then came American payments giant PayPal, which had been wanting to get a slice of India. In November last year, PayPal proposed an overall $500-million funding in Freecharge, giving it a 51% stake. This would involve buying out investors in Jasper Infotech to get shares of Freecharge and putting about $300 million of capital in the mobile wallet firm at a valuation of $800 million or so. Jasper Infotech is the parent of Snapdeal and Freecharge. The deal had a term which would give PayPal a put option to take over the remaining 49% stake in the e-wallet venture over the next few years. This transaction, too, fell through. "It started to look like SoftBank was stalling external investors because they wanted Snapdeal to merge with a bigger entity and Alibaba was a preferred partner. But post Diwali they figured Alibaba was not interested and by that time there was urgent need for capital at Snapdeal," said another person with knowledge of the matter. SoftBank Proposes To Sell Freecharge To Paytm After both these deals did not materialise, SoftBank put on the table a $1-billion funding proposal for Snapdeal in December last year when Masa was on an India visit.This would entail SoftBank buying Freecharge for $600 million, selling it to Paytm and subsequently pumping $400 million into Jasper Infotech, the parent of Snapdeal.At this time SoftBank valued the e-commerce player at around $3 billion. This would also let SoftBank get a 10-15% stake in Paytm, which was reaping the benefits of the Indian government's demonetisation move announced in November. But the funds did not come. SoftBank was still pushing for growth asking Snapdeal to bulk up its GMV . There had also been talks of a Freecharge sale to Ola Money , the payments platform run by another SoftBank portfolio company Ola -the transportation startup which is fighting Uber in India. Masa had offered a $1-billion funding proposal to Ola, at a reduced valuation of $3 billion (compared to $5 billion in its previous round).Ola didn't agree and only took $250 million, not wanting to give massive control to SoftBank, multiple people said. The cash position at Snapdeal was now starting to look worrying andorder numbers were slipping. The company was left with about $200 million in the bank and no new capital had come in for about a year while they were being asked to continue spending to grow in the last few months of 2016. "Snapdeal was asked to spend $50 million every month on marketing and promotions even until January. Somewhere around then they wanted to re-engage with eBay but Flipkart had already started negotiating with the online auction site. SoftBank had started engineering a Snapdeal sale by then," another source said. Early Investors Block Investment At Lower Valuation At the start of 2017, there was another possibility being drawn out. A $50-million-per-month offer by SoftBank, out of which $30 million was allocated to Snapdeal and $20 million would go to Freecharge.Snapdeal would be valued at $2.5 billion. That comittment was changed into a $150-million debt financial proposal which was being dished out by SoftBank. There was chatter building up at this time about how the online retailer's early investors Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners, which together own about 18% in the company , were blocking the capital infusion from SoftBank on the issue of lower valuation. They'd opposed the $50-million monthly installment, saying a drip feed by SoftBank was going to stir up more uncertainties, some people said. SoftBank Pushes For Merger With Flipkart While none of the SoftBank capital came in, by February-March SoftBank had initiated talks with Tiger Global to sell Snapdeal and get a substantial holding in the country's largest e-commerce company. We first reported this in our March 28 edition. This would give Tiger, Flipkart's largest investor, the much needed liquidity after having ploughed $1 billion into the 10-year-old company. Tiger would part-sell its shares to SoftBank and get the Japanese group to infuse fresh cash in Flipkart. The Bengaluru-based online retailer got itself $1.4 billion recently from two of the investors Snapdeal had engaged with (Tencent and eBay), along with Microsoft. In the recent weeks, Kalaari has agreed to sell its shares to SoftBank to get the sale through, Nexus is still fighting for a bigger payout. Forming An Anti-Amazon Coalition While the sale looks imminent now, external offers of funding not coming through seem to have contributed to the rapid degeneration of Snapdeal's value as the company's cash position worsened. SoftBank, which wants to put its weight behind only the number one players in the consumer internet space, has clearly reset its strategy for India as its bet on Snapdeal hasn't turned out to be what it had envisioned almost three years back. By backing Flipkart and Paytm with billions of dollars, SoftBank is betting on scale and will eventually look to bring further consolidation in what is still perceived to be a wild and irrationally exuberant internet commerce market."SoftBank will look to combine Flipkart and Paytm and hand it over to Alibaba. This will emerge as the biggest anti-Amazon coalition not only in India but globally too," says an investor on the condition of anonymity .

Nougat starts rolling out to the Samsung Chromebook Plus, but only for Canary builds right now Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:34pm PDTApr 26, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares82 Applications Google News Samsung Google renewed its commitment to running Android apps on Chromebooks earlier this year with the announcement of universal Android app support going forward. One of the first devices covered by this promise is the Samsung Chromebook Plus, and it's also (apparently) the first to get the latest version of Android. Nougat (7.1.1) has started rolling out, but you need to be on the bleeding edge to get it. Users of the Samsung Chromebook Plus are seeing the Nougat update from Marshmallow, but only if they're running the Canary build of Chrome. That's a step beyond running the dev channel as your device has to be in developer mode so you can enter some text commands. It's unstable, but you can apparently have Nougat right now. Nougat on Chromebooks includes one big user-facing feature that will make Android apps much more usable—resizing. Yes, you'll have more choices than full screen and not full screen. There's no telling when this will end up in the dev channel, but hopefully soon. The Canary build is v60, so keep an eye out for that to hit the other channels. Source: Reddit Tags apps chrome chrome os chromebook plus nougat Samsung subscribe ...

Morten Ulv Think its on the ChromeOS side, and I remember reading on Reddit that it's not in yet unfortunately. Fingers crossed it's coming. ericshmerick Everyone was like I'll buy the CB Plus then toss a 256gig SD in it! Then they realized you can't really use the SD for any Play Store apps... I returned the CBP inside of a week. The keyboard was horrible, no night mode for the screen (nightshift/night light/f.lux) and just felt slow to me. Pen was neat and screen pretty tho. Zsolt V "Everyone was like I'll buy the CB Plus then toss a 256gig SD in it!" I think you have an extremely distorted view of real users. Kevin Aaronson Ok Bru [971] V...60?? So 12 more weeks to wait?? Heeeeeeeeelll nooooooooooooooooo Morten Ulv 12 weeks? You're being optimistic. roberto.elena Why? Current stable version is 58. Isn't there a new version released every 6 weeks? Morten Ulv Well, Nougat has been available on canary for months on select Chromebooks. And when the play store first appeared on select Chromebooks, it was never bound to a ChromeOS version. It may come in 12 weeks, but that's far from certain. roberto.elena Oh I see, canary is a different beast than the rest of Chrome release channels then. Morten Ulv I think it's more that the Android features take longer to work out than the release cycle allow for. But I'm just guessing. Snowsky419 Does it support app shortcuts? PVL_93_RU No, since it's a launcher-specific feature and you're launching the apps from Chrome OS' app shelf Snowsky419 Oh, that makes sense. Thank you! :) Roy I don't​ get it. So it's running Chrome OS inside, but also Android Nougat? Someone could explain it to me please? Kevin Aaronson Yes Roy So why not call it Android with chrome apps? Kevin Aaronson It's chrome with Android apps. Roy What's the difference? Franco Rossel That the base is Chrome OS and it has an Android emulator on top, not the other way around. Kevin Aaronson Chromebooks use the chromeos. While you can run Android apps on a select few Chromebooks you can't navigate the Android os like you can using an Android device. The chrome developers have figured out a way to either emulate or marry the chromeos with Android. This allows the use of apps similar to the way you use chrome apps. The release of nougat on chromeos will bring them that much closer to parity, with the ability to resize the app like a native chrome app. But essentially they are 2 different operating systems based upon linux, with the parent os, chrome, able to run the Android os alongside or within. Lateef Alabi-Oki Android runs in what is called a "Container" inside Chrome OS. A "Container" is a faster and lightweight Virtual Machine. It can run an app, and its dependencies, in a sandboxed and isolated environment. Containerized applications share the same host OS, but don't share the same dependencies. In theory, a containerized application can run on any OS, as long as the OS supports an open standard container engine like Docker. Stephen Sharp Great! Not sure why its taking them so long when Anbox for Linux already has 7.1.1 but eh Randy Gindy Because Google has a different implementation of this. That and they have to make its completely stable and secure before releasing on the main branch. JG Google needs to release a ChromeOS powered Pixel C2 tablet. It would be nice if, by designing both Chrome and Android as well as the hardware, they could keep the Android portion of the tablet updated along side the pure-bred Android Pixel cousins (or within a short time frame there in)... Monthly security updates plus the quarter minor updates etc... Stephen Sharp needs more andromeda Zsolt V Is that a real thing or just a fanboy wet dream? DragoCubed Dream Stephen Sharp I'm going to bet it's real in some form, and that Android apps on ChromeOS is just a precursor to it. Randy Gindy Fuchsia OS, to me, is the biggest evidence of an OS convergence. DragoCubed Wasn't fuchsia OS for IoT? I think magenta was the kernel or something Randy Gindy Possibly. it's meant to run on amything though. DragoCubed In some form, yeah. You are right. 😊 we all need some hope. I feel bad for saying it was a dream. Stephen Sharp lol I used to really hope that Google would make desktop Android a real thing. I still think they will, however once Anbox matures more I don't really have a need. Even ChromeOS doesn't have as good long term support as Linux proper TedPhillips i'd rather have something in the vein of the device we were supposed to get with the original pixel c, sooner, than something that is still a ways off. the pixel c failure pretty much dropped the ball for the entire innovation 'quota' for the android tablet market (which is in pretty rough shape these days) though i suppose there could be some shocker at i/o about the other os.

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You In 2014, Masayoshi Son, Soft Bank's maverick billion aire founder tasked Nikesh Arora, a hotshot Google executive, who was about to join the Japanese telecom and internet major, with closing out a prospective investment in India.The deal was stuck on differences in valuation between SoftBank and the young entrepreneur. Masa had poached India-born Arora at the time and was in the midst of reinventing his organisation. SoftBank 2.0 is what the project was called, the vision was to make the group more global and take bets on technology startups. India was one such market the sprawling technology group was eyeing, and Arora was the man to take Masa's plan to fruition. On his India trip almost three years back, Arora met Kunal Bahl, the founder and CEO of Snapdeal, an online marketplace which Masa was keen to invest in. At the time Snapdeal was competing with Flipkart in India's hot e-commerce market which was about $6 billion in size. Arora convinced Bahl to agree to take SoftBank's money by offering a slightly better valuation.October 2014, marked the arrival of SoftBank as Snapdeal's largest investor as it led a $627-million financing round valuing the online marketplace at $1.2 billion and got itself a 33% stake in the company . Bahl and his co founder Rohit Bansal grew up in Delhi as school friends, went through multiple pivots (a startup jargon which means the change of a company's business model) since they began in 2007. In its latest avatar, Snapdeal wanted to be the Alibaba of India. Having backed the Chinese internet giant in its infancy, and having gained unprecedented returns after the muchballyhoed Alibaba IPO, SoftBank's bet on Snapdeal wasn't surprising at the time. Just a few months before Snapdeal's funding round was announced another seminal event had unfolded -the Bengalurubased Flipkart racked up $1 billion from a clutch of investors, valued at $7 billion. The e-commerce sweepstakes were only starting to play out with such an enormous and never-seen-before slug of capital chasing the Indian online retail story. Snapdeal's Rise Between 2014-15 After raising its largest financing round, Snapdeal started pushing the pedal. It wanted to compete head on with Flipkart, the country's largest online retailer which was growing on the back of massive smartphone sales. Gross merchandise value -or GMV ,a proxy indicator for growth in the e-commerce sector -was gaining currency rapidly and was being used to burnish the valuations of these companies. The Seattle-based online behemoth Amazon, which so far had been testing the India market, decided to throw down the gauntlet. In September 2014, its visionary founder Jeff Bezos famously stood on a truck outside the company's Bengaluru headquarters along with his India chief Amit Agarwal, waving a $2-billion cheque. From here on, the Indian ecommerce story started to change. Snapdeal reported a 301% jump in GMV for the year ended March 2015, according to documents put up by SoftBank during its earnings results. Between 2014 to 2015, the Indian e-commerce market almost doubled from $6 billion to $11.5 billion as discounting peaked. Still the No. 2 player, Snapdeal went on to successfully raise more money on the back of its growth. 2015: Tencent Turned Down, Alibaba Comes In When Snapdeal was racing ahead on the GMV front, Alibaba's arch rival, China's Tencent, expressed interest in the company. The internet major had offered to put $350 million at a $5-billion valuation, people privy to the talks said.We found out from sources that SoftBank wasn't keen on having Tencent on board and pushed for an Alibaba entry into Snapdeal.In the meantime, the web retailer went out and snagged the mobile wallet startup Freecharge in a $400-million deal, largely done through a share-swap to build its payments business. Then in August 2015, the e-tailer closed a fresh financing round of $500 million with Alibaba and Foxconn, valuing it at $4.8 billion. Tencent was ke pt out. Significantly enough, last month, the internet behemoth behind WeChat messenger invested in Flipkart. 2016: From GMV Race To Turning Profitable Snapdeal's revenue growth started to slow down sharply from 450% for the year ending March 2015 to 56% at Rs 1,457 crore a year later. Amazon was weaning away market share while Flipkart was stagnating. The overall industry had become sluggish, GMV numbers were flat for the industry at $11-12 billion. Now, Snapdeal had begun talking down GMV . Instead, it wanted to draw up a path to profitability -Bahl had been quoted as saying this publicly. Even as the change in strategy was starting to play out, Snapdeal got some more funds, this time from one of the world's largest pension funds,Ontario Teachers Pension Plan at a $6.5 billion valuation. The new investor had bought $150 million of secondary shares from Snapdeal's early investors and put $50 million into the company. By the middle of 2016, the e-tailer changed tack completely and figured fighting the war chest of Amazon wouldn't be easy, but the sudden news of Arora's departure in June last year from SoftBank was going to alter Snapdeal's future. The Nikesh Arora Factor We'd met Arora at SoftBank's Silicon Valley office a few days after he'd resigned. He'd said the Indian companies SoftBank had funded during his tenure will find support from Masa. But the Indian e-commerce sector had changed, he'd admitted. “In the last two years, what has happened is that Jeff Bezos (Amazon founder) has come out and said he wants to win India at all cost. He will spend billions of dollars in India and that's a new competitive fact. You have to figure out a way to compete with that. The question is does it become like an Alibaba JD, a two-player China market, or a multi-player market? That depends on execution,“ he said. Arora was of the view that Snapdeal was moving from negative to positive gross margins. “I know Snapdeal has started focusing on profitable GMV instead of just GMV ,“ he had said then. A person close to the company said, “His ( Arora) moving out of SoftBank was a big blow for Bahl and Snapdeal. The present team is trying to obliterate his legacy and his investment calls were being questioned. This is why SoftBank asked Snapdeal to chase growth, the opposite of what Arora was telling the company to do.“ After Arora, who was anointed by Masa as his successor, departed, others in his team like Deep Nishar, Kabir Misra (who's now on the Snapdeal board) and Alok Sama began actively liaising with the Indian e-commerce company . Masa also stepped in. He was now keeping himself abreast with what was going on at one of his earliest bets on India internet. While Arora was still around, he along with the Snapdeal founders had strung together a $350-mil lion financing from existing investor eBbay, which would have valued the e-commerce company at $6.5 billion, sources said. This deal would have involved folding up eBay india into Snapdeal. But this didn't come through. Last month, eBay India, which now has only 4-5% holding in Snapdeal, invested in Flipkart, and sold its local unit in the process. We'd reached out to Snapdeal and SoftBank spokespersons through an emailed questionnaire on the events leading up to the current situation which did not elicit a response. Sale To Alibaba Falls Through After Arora's exit, SoftBank started to press for a sale to Alibaba.People who were privy to the goings-on said SoftBank wanted to merge Snapdeal with Paytm's ecommerce marketplace and Freecharge with Paytm's payments play . While the discussions were on in full swing, the Jack Ma-led Alibaba didn't agree to the final deal, and after Diwali, Snapdeal found itself staring at its fast depleting cash reserves. Alibaba and its subsidiary Alipay are investors in Paytm. Foxconn, Paypal Bid For Freecharge Stake Even as SoftBank was trying to pull off the Alibaba Snapdeal transaction, Freecharge, which had been scouting for funds since 2015, was closing in on a deal with Foxconn sometime around July last year. The Taiwanese manufacturer of Apple iPhones was ready to pump in $300 million, valuing Freecharge at around $800 million. SoftBank was willing to participate with half of that sum, but the deal never closed.Then came American payments giant PayPal, which had been wanting to get a slice of India. In November last year, PayPal proposed an overall $500-million funding in Freecharge, giving it a 51% stake. This would involve buying out investors in Jasper Infotech to get shares of Freecharge and putting about $300 million of capital in the mobile wallet firm at a valuation of $800 million or so. Jasper Infotech is the parent of Snapdeal and Freecharge. The deal had a term which would give PayPal a put option to take over the remaining 49% stake in the e-wallet venture over the next few years. This transaction, too, fell through. “It started to look like SoftBank was stalling external investors because they wanted Snapdeal to merge with a bigger entity and Alibaba was a preferred partner. But post Diwali they figured Alibaba was not interested and by that time there was urgent need for capital at Snapdeal,“ said another person with knowledge of the matter. SoftBank Proposes To Sell Freecharge To Paytm After both these deals did not materialise, SoftBank put on the table a $1-billion funding proposal for Snapdeal in December last year when Masa was on an India visit.This would entail SoftBank buying Freecharge for $600 million, selling it to Paytm and subsequently pumping $400 million into Jasper Infotech, the parent of Snapdeal.At this time SoftBank valued the e-commerce player at around $3 billion. This would also let SoftBank get a 10-15% stake in Paytm, which was reaping the benefits of the Indian government's demonetisation move announced in November. But the funds did not come. SoftBank was still pushing for growth asking Snapdeal to bulk up its GMV . There had also been talks of a Freecharge sale to Ola Money , the payments platform run by another SoftBank portfolio company Ola -the transportation startup which is fighting Uber in India.Masa had offered a $1-billion funding proposal to Ola, at a reduced valuation of $3 billion (compared to $5 billion in its previous round).Ola didn't agree and only took $250 million, not wanting to give massive control to SoftBank, multiple people said. The cash position at Snapdeal was now starting to look worrying andorder numbers were slipping. The company was left with about $200 million in the bank and no new capital had come in for about a year while they were being asked to continue spending to grow in the last few months of 2016. “The company was asked to spend $50 million every month on marketing and promotions even until January . Somewhere around then they wanted to re-engage with eBay but Flipkart had already started negotiating with the online auction site. SoftBank had started engineering a Snapdeal sale by then,“ another source said. Early Investors Block Investment At Lower Valuation At the start of 2017, there was another possibility being drawn out.A $50-million-per-month offer by SoftBank, out of which $30 million was allocated to Snapdeal and $20 million would go to Freecharge.Snapdeal would be valued at $2.5 billion. That comittment was changed into a $150-million debt financial proposal which was being dished out by SoftBank. There was chatter building up at this time about how the online retailer's early investors Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners, which together own about 18% in the company , were blocking the capital infusion from SoftBank on the issue of lower valuation. They'd opposed the $50-million monthly installment, saying a drip feed by SoftBank was going to stir up more uncertainties, some people said. SoftBank Pushes For Merger With Flipkart While none of the SoftBank capital came in, by February-March SoftBank had initiated talks with Tiger Global to sell Snapdeal and get a substantial holding in the country's largest e-commerce company . We first reported this in our March 28 edition. This would give Tiger, Flipkart's largest investor, the much needed liquidity after having ploughed $1 billion into the 10-year-old company. Tiger would part-sell its shares to SoftBank and get the Japanese group to infuse fresh cash in Flipkart. The Bengaluru-based online retailer got itself $1.4 billion recently from two of the investors Snapdeal had engaged with (Tencent and eBay), along with Microsoft. In the recent weeks, Kalaari has agreed to sell its shares to SoftBank to get the sale through, Nexus is still fighting for a bigger payout. Forming Anti-Amazon Coalition While the sale looks imminent now, external offers of funding not coming through seem to have contributed to the rapid degeneration of Snapdeal's value as the company's cash position worsened. SoftBank, which wants to put its weight behind only the number one players in the consumer internet space, has clearly reset its strategy for India as its bet on Snapdeal hasn't turned out to be what it had envisioned almost three years back. By backing Flipkart and Paytm with billions of dollars, SoftBank is betting on scale and will eventually look to bring further consolidation in what is still perceived to be a wild and irrationally exuberant internet commerce market.“SoftBank will look to combine Flipkart and Paytm and hand it over to Alibaba. This will emerge as the biggest anti-Amazon coalition not only in India but globally too,“ says an investor on the condition of anonymity .

Chrome 62 will mark all HTTP pages with data entry fields as "Not Secure" Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 11:08am PDTApr 27, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares99 Applications Google News Google has been planning to mark all HTTP sites as non-secure in Chrome for a while now, but the company is taking baby steps to ensure users (and owners of HTTP-only sites) don't freak out. Chrome already identifies HTTP sites with password or credit card fields as "Not Secure" in the address bar, and Chrome 62 will expand that to any HTTP site with any data entry fields. As you can see in the above image, the 'Not Secure' warning will only appear on page load if you're in incognito mode. Otherwise, it will show up when you begin entering text. This will obviously affect far more pages than the current warning, including any pages with a search field. Chrome 62 will be released sometime in October 2017.

JG I think it could be helpful if Google were to float the "Not Secure" warning near the actual input boxes at least when you mouse over and/or select them. It would be a good extra reminder that you are entering text into a form that may not be protected. Especially if done on a mobile device, when the address bar containing the "not secure" warning could have been scrolled off screen by the time the input boxes appear on screen. proper Firefox does that Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I have this warning now in 58 beta. Romario Maxwell I found a Chrome flag to enable this behaviour: chrome://flags/#enable-http-form-warning 4Ui812 Google knows about insecure things 😉 A Person This will include HTTPS form actions loaded over HTTP. So even if the data submitted is secure, the page load must also be secure. This is already the case on desktop. roebling Great idea! Siddharth We trust you Team AP! On a lighter note even with a warning I would venture here just to see when the next pixel, OnePlus is getting leaked ;) MeCampbell30 I'm curious how the AP staff feels about moving to https (obviously you guys are doing it, but do you feel it's worth the effort?). I'd love to hear about it on the podcast. Simon Buckley HTTPS has benefits beyond improved privacy. Moving to HTTPS means that HTTP/2 can be used, resulting in faster page loads, better site compression during transport, multiplexing, and a bunch of developer-centric features like server push and asset prioritisation. This all means that users get a faster, better experience. From a business perspective, Google's search algorithms lend favour to encrypted sites as well. TL;DR - It's worth the effort. Jordan I don't think encryption ended up as a requirement for HTTP/2 in the standard, but it's a requirement in some implementations (because the standard isn't so rigorous). RainMotorsports It isn't a requirement but I haven't seen any implementation that doesn't require it. Romario Maxwell Is there a Chrome flag that can be set to display the "Not Secure" label for all visited HTTP pages right now? I know it's an eventuality in there road map though. Rob It literally takes seconds to implement SSL. If AP doesn't know how to do this faster than they're going here, this line: "If you're wondering when Android Police will switch to HTTPS, don't worry - we're nearly there." means they're pretty clueless. Jordan Maybe it's not that easy to implement on their CDN. You are making some very large assumptions about the site's configuration and platform. RainMotorsports Seconds? Sounds like you don't bother testing your cypher selection against your customer bases support needs. I wouldn't just copy and paste. Someone else's choice may leave a scenario unsupported or a cypher that's not needed that will one day end up being the next attack. Let's not forget we need to write scripts to proxy any outside content. Test our external services providers. In this case disqus is the obvious one. Should be good but who knows what else they rely on? abc You might have a point 5 years ago. But it's 2017. If a site doesnt have HTTPs by now, it's probably because they don't care for it. RainMotorsports Pretty sure I still have a point. Most sites that don't store customer information didn't care. Why should a blog be https? Do most of your users care if the government can see what phones you like? This change was only announced in the last couple of months. That's when sites that have no reason to care started caring. If you want to attack someone go attack the sysadmin that whine they have no right to do this to his site and that haven't been breached in years. abc "If you're wondering when Android Police will switch to HTTPS, don't worry - we're nearly there."

Joycee Awosika of ORÍKÌ Shares 30 Lessons She Learned in 30 Days as a Mother 27.04.2017 at 1:03 pm By BellaNaija.com 10 Comments Nothing prepares you more for life as a mother than the arrival of your precious one. The sudden change in your life can cause you to feel overwhelmed, helpless, and stressed. However, each day gets better, as you learn more and more. You become an expert in your own right. Being the nerd, ultimate “Googler,” and inquisitive researcher that I am, the past 30 days my Google Search box has seen every kind of newborn inquiry there is. Some of the things I included made me wish that I had a list like this to read 30 days ago. I hope for this list to inspire, entertain and maybe even motivate you to react in whichever way feels right. I make no claims, nor am I an expert, but the following are 30 of the most important lessons I’ve learned from my first 30 days as a mother. 1. Your pediatrician doesn’t know it all about your baby and neither do you… yet. Pay attention to your baby’s cues, their actions speak louder than words. 2. It is a pure gift to be a mother, your baby should be the main priority and don’t apologize for it. Other obligations can wait. “Behold, children are a heritage and gift from the Lord, The fruit of the womb a reward.” Ps. 127:3 3. Your healing is equally as important as taking care of your baby. If you aren’t working towards a speedy recovery for yourself, you can’t give your baby your best. 4. Being superwoman doesn’t gain you a reward at this stage. Healing is a factor of time and a concerted effort. You cannot do it all. Ask for help and take the help you get. 5. The Know-It-Alls you complain about to your girlfriends (grandmothers, mothers, aunts, sisters) may actually KNOW it all. Experience is the best teacher; appreciate them and hear them out. 6. BUT…don’t let anyone make you think you don’t know your own baby best. Don’t let anyone make you think you’re not doing a good job. There are many ways to be an excellent parent. 7. Bring your husband in closely to you and the baby. Don’t push him away. He wants to also bond with the baby and be there for you. If this is your first child, it’s new for him too; he’s learning – remember that. 8. Eat good food and plenty of it. If you are breastfeeding your baby, he/she needs their mommy to eat often and eat well. A gallon of water plus some, everyday, does your body real good. That parched dry feeling in your mouth, while breastfeeding, isn’t fun. 9. Mothers milk tea is the clutch! I know it seems ridiculous that tea can help you produce more milk, but give it a try. Buy it, consume it and make yourself a cold refreshing glass of iced tea – it doesn’t need to be consumed hot 10. Breastfeeding is HARD. It is emotionally and physically draining but it’s worth it (if you can). You will likely feel a sense of accomplishment. 11. Exclusive breastfeeding is on another level of tedious. Besides adequate nourishment, keep a mentally free mind. Stress has an adverse effect. Sounds impossible, but you can do it. 12. The changes that occur in your female region after pregnancy aren’t pretty. Google “lochia” before you have your baby. That’s one of the Google searches I greatly appreciated post delivery and wished I did it before hand. No one told me about this before delivery. 13. Never say you don’t want a baby shower (that was me). Grateful for my surprise baby shower and all baby boy’s gifts received. Babies are expensive! 14. You know the side eye you give, and feeling you have, when you get ANOTHER gift of diapers? Trust me you’ll need it! Appreciate them. 15. Going through 6 or more diaper changes a day causes you to become a pro quickly (not so bad after all). There should be a competition for the fastest and cleanest poopy diaper changes! 16. If your baby needs a pacifier and it works for you both, use it. Don’t put unnecessary pressure on you or your baby. Everyone has an opinion, but do trials. 17. Some babies LOVE food more than others. The “Feed every 2-3 hours” mantra isn’t always right. My baby is a milk guzzler – he eats almost every hour to hour and a half, when he’s awake and that’s perfectly fine. 18. Pump, pump, pump! You may feel like a cow using a manual pump, electrical pump and using your hand to express, but it helps to establish your milk supply and increase it. Plus, knowing how many ounces your baby is actually eating, is a smart idea. 19. Buy a pumping bra! Being able to pump from both breasts and have your hands free is a major win. This invention is a genius one. 20. It’s perfectly normal to worry about whether your milk supply is adequate, especially when your baby is always eager to eat. Don’t be hard on yourself. Remember, sometimes your baby just wants to comfort feed. Put him or her on your breast; it’s better than a piercing cry. 21. Your pregnancy hormones are still at play after birth; your emotions may be in disarray. Take a deep breath and allow yourself to experience the ups and downs; but always seek help when you need it. 22. Buy plenty of baby sleepers “snap pajamas” (the one piece zip or button down clothing that has sleeves and legs). It’s the easiest thing to put on the baby and very comfortable and efficient for quick diaper changes 23. Confide in your husband; tell him how you are feeling and be open. He’s not your enemy during this period. He can be your greatest help. 24. Johnson’s & Johnsons may potentially have the biggest market share for baby stuff, but I’m not a fan. As a natural enthusiast, coconut oil and natural soaps and shampoos have been my go to. I only want the best for baby boy 25. The nursing pillow “boppy” was a great purchase. Being able to use my laptop and phone while the baby is feeding is an accomplishment, aided by this accessory. 26. Take lots of pictures/videos and try to get in them when you can. These memories will serve you well in the future- plus you can tease your child with them in later years. 27. In the past 30 days, I’ve barely used a water thermometer (you can tell if the temperature is ok by your finger) A baby tub works best for us when I’m carrying him and sitting in the tub. A bassinet (baby boy hates it; although we are working on changing this. You need to figure out what works for your baby) and baby shoes/designer clothes. All these are cute, but I want him comfortable; plus, these little ones grow so fast, is it worth it?! You can probably do without some of these. 28. Griping, gas and hiccups are all normal for your newborn. As hard as it is to watch your baby uncomfortable, it comes with the territory and this phase will pass. Keep gripe water on hand, and if you are breastfeeding, monitor what you eat to see if it triggers these things. Spicy food is NOT a good idea. 29. He/She is not weird or abnormal for twitching, smiling while sleeping, or fighting your boobs – even though it’s clear they are hungry. Your baby’s brain is developing and he’s getting acquainted with what his limbs can do. Also, it’s different being out in this world, after almost a year in your cozy womb. 30. We are indeed fearfully and wonderfully made. God in his infinite wisdom equipped us with all we need to take care of our babies. Trust God and trust your instincts. *** Joycee Awosika is a wife to a King, an entrepreneur, economist and a new mother.

But with my second child did exclusive for 3 months and it was very very enough. Different things for different babies. No 24 is so correct, never never a fan of J&J team natural all the way, the two mothers will go to Elewe Omo and get her cream, bath soap, soap for teeth etc., And they are super good they come along with it when they are coming Love this! 11 Reply Sidechicksarewinning April 27, 2017 at 2:53 pm Joycee joycee congrats on the birth of your baby. Call me judgina but it’s hard to take you serious knowing the life you lived pre-marriage. Have to give it you. You were selling your market well. And then you had the nerve to go in on your ex with caustic comments on his BN column. I guess that’s why BN pulled his piece. Its aiight. I’m sure in your mind you’re doing so well and all. That maybe true but remember karma oh Nne. What goes around comes back around my darling. Enjoy it while it lasts. Love this! 11 Reply Nuna April 28, 2017 at 9:16 am Wawu. This was not necessary naa Love this! 5 Reply Wisdom April 29, 2017 at 4:49 am Life is too short , live your life and let others live and stop judging. Others can learn from this. Keep the momentum going Joycee Love this! 5 Reply PEN April 27, 2017 at 4:16 pm In other words, no need for lists to motherhood. Let be, and let life be your teacher. Love this! 9 Reply Livie April 27, 2017 at 4:18 pm Great list! Extremely helpful! The only thing I would add to your list is “get prepared for sleep deprivation”. Nobody warned me about that, it was such a rude awakenening for me lol. My baby is 6months, is no longer waking up every hour or two and is now sleeping for longer blocks ( 4 hours lol) so I’m getting more sleep now. He hasnt done a full 7 hour stretch yet though, hopefully that it’s happen soon. He also no longer seems interested in eating much during the night and only awakens to be comforted and put back to bed. Oh and another thing I’d add is “learn to start planning ahead!. Having a baby strips you of that ability to make impromptu social commitments. Remember the days of your girls calling you up randomly to invite you for this event or that event! They’re over ! Lool. Now you need advance notice so you can plan accordingly and prepare adequately for baby to be taken care of in your absence ( especially when you’re going out with your husband), whether it’s dropping baby and nanny off with your mother or with a trusted relative etc. Also, fatigue and tiredness in those first few months tend to drain you making it more difficult to go out late at night etc. Enjoy your newborn Joyce! Babies are a blessing and a gift!!! A lot of work but ultimately precious, beautiful gifts! Baby dust to all hopefully mothers!!! Love this! 4 Reply Blessed April 27, 2017 at 9:13 pm Thanks for sharing Joycee, wish I saw this before I gave birth! I love how genuine you were and trust that you will keep learning on this journey of motherhood! P.s. Keep it up with all you do people will always talk and come with side comments but it comes with the territory. Face forward and keep winning! Love this! 5 Reply Neka April 30, 2017 at 4:11 am Lovely article Joycee. Nigerians we really need to stop this mediocrity if we are to move forward however. I finished reading the nice article, found it useful and went on to opening the website of the writer as it is linked on the page. Upon opening it, there is nothing on the site but a link to sign up for news. I’m not sure if the website is still under construction or that there is simply no content yet but how about wait till there is content to share? Love this! 3 Reply Beloved April 30, 2017 at 12:59 pm Her website is clearly being updated and modified which is why there is an option to stay connected and hear more. You can simply stay connected if you CHOOSE to and the homepage clearly tells you what the website will be about. It is standard. Have a blessed day! Love this! 2 Reply Sue May 1, 2017 at 3:57 am Thanks.

The home affairs select committee, says that the behaviour of Facebook, Twitter and Google has been "completely irresponsible and indefensible" and that they should now be presented with the bill for investigating crimes committed over their networks. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Internet firms have faced repeated accusations that they are failing to address concerns over the material being published on their platforms. Photo: Bloomberg It is "shockingly easy" to find terrorist material online and companies should face multi-million pound fines and sanctions unless they begin taking robust action. Similar "policing" charges are levied on football clubs and late-night drinking establishments which are blamed for fuelling certain types of crime. Related Content Facebook can't have it both ways, Germans say Norway blasts Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg for censoring 'napalm girl' photograph Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, welcomed the report and said its recommendations were being studied "carefully" while police chiefs also said that action was now necessary. Half of all crimes reported to police now involve some element of social media involvement, with terrorist offences, hate crimes and threats of violence all being committed online. Advertisement Ministers have had to introduce specific offences to cover crimes committed over social media such as grooming and stalking - and there are growing fears over violent incidents now being live-streamed on Facebook and other sites. Internet firms have faced repeated accusations that they are failing to address concerns over the material being published on their platforms. Ms Rudd said that social media firms had to prove that they were serious about tackling criminal activity online. She said: "We have made it very clear that we will not tolerate the internet being used as a place for terrorists to promote their vile views, or use social media platforms to weaponise the most vulnerable people in our communities. "We will continue to push the internet companies to make sure they deliver on their commitments to further develop technical tools to identify and remove terrorist propaganda and to help smaller companies to build their capabilities. I will expect to see early and effective action." A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs Council said: "Hate and extremist material online is a serious problem with potentially very dangerous consequences. This is an interesting idea. Social media companies' failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace Yvette Cooper, home affairs committee "The detail would need to be considered but we are supportive of looking at a range of ways to speed up removing this content wherever it is being shared." The home affairs committee, headed by Yvette Cooper, the former Labour Cabinet minister, calls on Theresa May to punish social media companies that fail to remove criminal content after its investigation found they were "shamefully far" from tackling terrorist and criminal postings properly. Ms Cooper said: "Social media companies' failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace. "They have been asked repeatedly to come up with better systems to remove illegal material such as terrorist recruitment or online child abuse." The committee adds it is "completely irresponsible and indefensible" that online companies do not take down banned material as soon as it is posted and warned that sanctions and multi-million pound fines should be introduced to force them to take it seriously. Earlier this month Twitter was heavily criticised for refusing to share crucial anti-terrorism information with the Government. The MPs say it was "shockingly easy" to find hate speech and terrorist propaganda online, particularly on YouTube. In one example: "Twitter refused to remove a cartoon that we reported depicting a group of male, ethnic minority migrants tying up and abusing a semi-naked white woman, while stabbing her baby to death. It refused to take action on the grounds that it was not in breach of [Twitter's] hateful conduct policy." The NSPCC welcomed the report and called on politicians to protect children online by doing more to tackle the problem of illegal material. The report states: "Social media companies rely on their users to report extremist and hateful content for review by moderators. They are, in effect, outsourcing the vast bulk of their safeguarding responsibilities at zero expense. "In the UK, the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit monitors social media companies for terrorist material. That means that multi-billion pound companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter are expecting the taxpayer to bear the costs of keeping their platforms and brand reputations clean of extremism." People who use multiple social media accounts only meet friends once a fortnight, a survey has found.

Bond panel can’t quite agree By Rachel Koning Beals Published: Apr 28, 2017 5:58 p.m. ET Share Inflation is headed to 3%, which means bond yields must go much higher, says Morningstar panelist Shutterstock Is inflation about to rise well above the Fed’s target? By RachelKoning Beals News editor Bond market decision-makers, including BlackRock’s Rick Rieder, have quite a mixed view of inflation risks. Their divide is tied to a puzzling U.S. economy in turn boosted by technology muscle and rising wages but dragged down by high debt levels and global risks. Sonal Desai, director of research for Templeton Global Macro, told the Morningstar Investment Conference on Friday that she thinks investors are too complacent about the risks of inflation. Inflation, she argues, could well hit 3% this year, driven by wages and proposed tax cuts, although potentially limited by immigration tightening. That’s above the Federal Reserve’s target of roughly 2% and is significantly above where market expectations sit, she said. Accordingly, the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.87%  could climb to near 3% “even if the Federal Reserve goes two or three times” with interest-rate hikes this year, she said. Rieder, who joined Desai on the bond-market panel, thinks inflation has already peaked this year and is likely to stick closer to the 2% target. It’s increasingly harder to assess true inflation and compare it to the past because it’s held down by productivity gains in a technology-driven service sector. That was apparent this week in strong performance reports from Google parent Alphabet GOOGL, +3.71%  and Amazon AMZN, +0.72%  , he said. Read: Google parent Alphabet has revenue drivers ahead, but also growing costs And: Amazon earnings beat sends stock to record levels Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at PIMCO, was also a panel participant. He sees some risk that the inflation-mindful Fed overshoots with rate hikes this year. He expects up to three hikes total in 2017. Don’t miss: Fed to signal rate-hike plan in place despite soft economic data Markets are prepared for a two- to three-hike path from the central bank, he said. In fact, the bigger unknown comes in 2018 because “we don’t know if Trump will support [Fed Chairwoman Janet] Yellen for another term.” The panel largely agreed that Yellen has been an effective communicator to markets on interest-rate policy, including with rough plans for a balance sheet paydown, in an effort to avoid the “taper tantrum” shock that Yellen predecessor Ben Bernanke unleashed on markets. Rieder said one of the biggest risks is that debt has really roared back, on a consumer and a corporate level, as well as the government’s load. If the Fed really starts aggressively raising rates, people are going to be paying more on their debt pretty quickly, including Washington. That poses two scenarios. First, that even slightly higher rates slows the economy more than the Fed is expecting or two, that the Fed responds by curtailing the number of expected rate hikes. Read: BlackRock CEO Fink likes Trump policies, is skeptical on Trump himself Also on Rieder’s high-risk list is China and its own debt loads. Though its share of global demand may not be as high as it once was, its appetite for commodities and goods overall remains a key driver for growth in the developed world. Ivascyn agreed: “There is still aggressive lending taking place [in China]. It’s a tail scenario you need to be aware of, but we think the base-case continues and they muddle through” a period of slower growth. The globe is impacting the bond market in other ways, Ivascyn said. After all, a first-round French election this month drew much of Wall Street to its devices on a Sunday, when nationalism and euroskepticism were in play. That demand for market attention makes it hard for interest rates to rise in a world marked with this much uncertainty, he said.

Unfortunately it’s easy to forget about this when you reach an online checkout and finally seal the deal on that new thingamabob you’ve been waiting to buy. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Always check for the HTTPS padlock when you’re concerned about online privacy and security. HTTPS isn’t just for online shopping, it’s important to check the security status of any website which asks you to enter sensitive information, such as online banking, webmail, cloud storage/services, social media, online forums and content management systems. Google also uses it to safeguard your online searches.Think of HTTPS a bit like a mini-VPN just for that individual browser tab. It doesn’t stop people seeing which page you’re visiting, but it creates an encrypted tunnel from your browser and the way to the webpage server to stop anyone in between snooping on your activities. HTTPS is still important even if you’re using a VPN, as the VPN only protects your data as far as the VPN server.Perhaps more importantly, HTTPS also relies on signed security certificates to ensure that you haven’t accidentally visited a spoof website masquerading as your bank or a legit online retailer.Google’s Chrome web browser is already one of the best at drawing your attention to HTTPS. It displays a green padlock with the word “Secure” alongside the website address, plus it often displays the name of the company to which the security certificate was issued – something you probably see when you use online banking. Advertisement There’s a push to use HTTPS across the web, with Electronic Frontiers Foundation even offering the HTTPS Everywhere browser plugin to force sites to use HTTPS if the website developer has enabled it.At the moment the Chrome browser draws attention to any website which doesn’t use HTTPS, although it only displays a subtle “i” symbol where the padlock should be.

Google adds the Pixels to its end-of-life support page Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 12:41pm PDTApr 27, 2017 95 Plus 1 on G+ 311 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares479 Android OS Google News Pixel Pixel XL Update 1: 2017/04/27 8:49pm PDT As it turns out, this is not new information. Google simply updated the table on the support page to include the end-of-life for the Pixel/XL security patches, confirming the October 2019 One of the bummers about buying electronic devices is that you know there will be a point after which the manufacturer will no longer keep the software updated. We usually hope for at least two years when talking about smartphones, though some OEMs barely even reach half that time. One of the benefits to buying Google's phones nowadays is that the company now maintains a page where you can see the end-of-life for those devices. El Goog just updated that page and the section for the Pixels — if you own either of those phones, or are still considering buying one, then this is good information to have. As expected, both the Pixel and Pixel XL will be definitely getting Android version updates up to October of 2018. And as for security, Google is committing to October of 2019 for those. At least this shows some level of transparency on Google's part, and it also means that the company is sticking to its earlier two-year version/three-year security updates promise. Update 1: 2017/04/27 8:49pm PDT As it turns out, this is not new information. Google simply updated the table on the support page to include the end-of-life for the Pixel/XL security patches, confirming the October 2019 date that we already knew.

Lovely. EcE Did you expect any different? pfmiller I didn't expect different but I always hope Google will someday realize 2 years is inadequate. Suicide_Note I think it's adequate, but different strokes for different folks. John Doe Is it adequate when you compare the Pixel to Google's main competitor...the iPhone? Timmy Turner Yes because everyone iOS update doesn't provide the same features for those on older hardware. John Doe LoL nice try sidestepping the issue at hand. Timmy Turner I'm not sidestepping anything. I use both platforms and I think the argument that Apple supports hardware with software longer is a bad one. John Doe Updating an operating system is not just for "new features", you give it a new updated UI, fix bugs, security issues, etc. I guess Microsoft updating all windows machines to Windows 10 is a bad argument for you as well? If you don't want to update then that is your choice but the fact that there is no update in the first place is just plain INADEQUATE. Timmy Turner No MS updating all it's machine is good business, obviously. I'm not saying I agree with Google's practice but I do understand it. Desktops and laptops age much better than smartphones, people keep them longer therefore there is a higher incentive for updates to roll out. Also I think the security updates should be a given, but it comes a point where you have to stop updating otherwise we wouldn't buy anything new. It's business. John Doe It's bad business. You don't see Apple updating their older devices hurting their bottom line because they know how to sell products and introduce new hardware features. Timmy Turner If you hate the way Google does business so much, then why not just drop Android and join iPhone users if you're concerned with software updates this much? Also, I do see Apple updating their older devices and screwing up quite a few. When the iPhone 6 got iOS 10 there were users complaining about sluggish the device felt there after. John Doe THAT IS JUST A FUCKEN STUPID ARGUMENT. I like Android and I want it to be better. Also, go check how many posts here on Android police of Google fucking up OTA updates...every company screws up sometimes it does not matter how old the hardware is. Timmy Turner Well first off, it was an argument. It was a question. Good answer by the way. I'm glad you feel so strongly about Android's improvement. I am well aware that Google gets it wrong, a little too often sometimes. My only point here today was that we can't expect Google to support these devices forever. 2-3 is honestly a long time, I don't expect more than that because beyond that there's probably features that will be half-baked on my dated device. The gesture would be appreciated but not something that personally needed. John Doe And I am saying if you are going to create a premium device that competes with Apple then you need to make sure it is as valuable as the iPhone. You need to make sure it is worth the premium price and it has a high resale value (which will be impossible if Google does not support the phone for longer than 3 years) You have your opinion about the issue which is you agree with what Google is doing and I have mine. I don't know who is right or wrong but what I do know is the Pixel devices are not doing so well against the iPhone and they advertised them a lot so there is something missing (probably stock LoL) and Google needs to change some policies. Timmy Turner Lol I have to agree with you there, Google definitely isn't competiting at the level I thought they would when the Pixel line was announced. Suicide_Note Why on Earth would/should Google be at all concerned with a 2 or 3 year old phone's resale value? That's absurd. John Doe If you want to have a "Premium" product then you need to be concerned about resale value. Apple flaunts the iPhone's resale value because it is a sign that people want their devices and "value" them greater than others. Luckbuckets like i said, security updates for atleast 3 years, i would call new UI is a feature, fix bugs i believe also come along with security if there are any worth fixing. Most anyone that really cares about having the latest and greatest software and actual performance updates more often that that anyways so if you want to be on 3 year old hardware and complain, thats your option. John Doe Again, look at Google's competition, Apple. If you can't offer the same value as your competition then don't charge the same amount of money. It is simple economics here. TheSpaceUnicorn Well, the important thing here is that value is subjective. I wish Google would offer software support for longer than 2 years, but it's not something that diminishes the value of their phones, imo. John Doe Yes it does. If your device is supported for a longer time then it will be more valuable than a phone that is supported for a short time LoL Simple Logic here. Go look at the value of iPhones overtime vs Android phones. Try to sell an iPhone 5, S5, Nexus 5 and see which phone kept its value overtime. TheSpaceUnicorn And what if I don't care about resale value, and plan of replacing my phone in 3 years anyway? How does not offering longer than 2 years of OS support diminish the value of the phone to me? John Doe You might not care about resale value but the market does. Not everyone is going to throw their phones in the garbage after they stop using them. WTF? TheSpaceUnicorn Who's just throwing their old phones in the garbage? John Doe Exactly, that is why people care about resale value because whether they decide to sell it, give it away, or keep it...they know that the phone still has value if they didn't they would throw it away. I don't know about you but I don't keep things that don't have a value to me. TheSpaceUnicorn I don't keep things either, but I couldn't possibly care less about resale value. I buy phones to enjoy them while have them, not to turn around and get as much as I can selling it later on. Suicide_Note I throw mine away if i don't feel like putting the forth the effort to sell it. itsjustironic Your logic is flawed and is just conjecture. Outside of tech communities, the average consumer more than likely has little knowledge of their phones supported life. Did you maybe ever think of something called branding? It's why companies pump billions to build their brand. It's why people will pay 10x more for a t-shirt slapped with the Nike logo on it as opposed to the plain tshirt that more than likely came from the same factory. Heck they can even keep a high resale value because they don't know how to depreciate properly. While people may resell it later on, I doubt most people purchase a product and the main factor in purchasing it is how much they can recoup when they sell it later. John Doe Google's brand is as valuable if not better than Apple's. People outside the tech community are not stupid they know when a new OS is launched. "While people may resell it later on, I doubt most people purchase a product and the main factor in purchasing it is how much they can recoup when they sell it later." That is not what I said. It does not matter what you bought the phone for because the market will determine the value of the product you have by its resale value which will tell you if you had a "premium" product or not. This is how you measure the value of a product not by people's opinions or a company's brand but how much is it actually worth to people, how much are people willing to buy it again? Luckbuckets simple economics, if you dont want it, dont buy it. In an ideal world our phones would update for ever but you can't expect that and atleast they are giving you fair warning before you buy. John Doe Actually most of these devices were not given an exact date when they were released. Also, if Google's stance is "If you don't want it, don't buy it" then they have much bigger issues than software updates. MicroNix Agreed but really. The hardware now is matured enough that it can last far past 2 years. Whoever thought 2 years was acceptable for a $700 PC? No one. So why treat your $700 phone any different? I squarely blame the carriers who started conditioning people to get a new phone every 2 years when they had contracts. Now everyone thinks its normal to have to buy one every two years. Marcelove Everyone? Nope.... Only idiots... Or idiot prostitutes that keep giving their money to someone that only want to screw them. Michael Jones And yet it isn't. The iPhone 5 got iOS 10 with all the latest security updates. Yes it is missing some features but those people's most personal devices are still very secure. It even got a massive speed boost for those coming from iOS 9. The amount of insecure Android devices running around due to the update problem is insane. Duder12 Google doesnt have control of the processor like apple does which means no drivers. John Doe Then Google shouldn't be charging what Apple does LoL Kiko Eschobar Exactly lol... Zsolt V I'd rather have a full set of updates for a shorter period of time than a gimped update designed for you to buy the latest color of a 4-year old design. Michael Jones Google has been making devices for a while now. They are also one of the richest companies in the world. If they actually wanted to support these devices for longer they would be trying to put it in their contract with Qualcomm. Money for support goes a long way. Nathan Bryant Have you seen an iPhone 5 run iOS 10? Painful. Michael Jones Still leagues better than it was with iOS 9. Pretty well documented at this point. Timmy Turner I agree about security as far as iOS goes but I know too many people who had to deal with shitty feature updates because they were on older hardware that couldn't handle it. It's no secret that hardware doesn't keep up with software. TheSpaceUnicorn It's not merely an argument, it's a fact that Apple gives their hardware software support for longer than Google. For the most part, the only software features old iPhones don't get are features that require hardware that new iPhones come with. AndroidUser00110001 When Siri was first introduced Apple claimed it wouldn't be available on older hardware but then it has hacked to work on the older hardware... TheSpaceUnicorn I take it you missed the part where I said "for the most part" Zsolt V Let's try to get real. Luckbuckets hey man, if you want google to change it to 5 year and just change the number you see, im sure that might be an option the might entertain. features are a big part of updates and they are covering the phones for security for atleast 3 years. it is what it is Luckbuckets meant to reply to johndoe Timmy Turner Kind of figured lol John Doe The problem is that they are not doing well with software updates/security updates as what their main competitor(Apple) is doing. Luckbuckets they also sell more of those models that google does, if google sold as many pixels as iphone 7's then im sure there would be more concern EcE Add some Android manufacturers on the table, get more negotiating power on your side, sell less phones as the current phones keep getting updated.... oh wait. John Doe LoL that is just a silly argument. Sales have nothing to do with this and if it does then we now know why they aren't selling enough lmao Dmitry Stepanushkin +1. failed. +1 again. now it's +2😀 TheSpaceUnicorn Good thing old iPhones get new features with new iOS updates then, huh? Suicide_Note Yes, it is, because i buy a new phone or two every year, so I'm fine with this. John Doe I guess you are in the minority because more people are buying iPhones than Pixels. I am not saying OS updates are the reason but Apple is obviously doing something right and Google plenty wrong with regards to their "premium devices". Zsolt V Yes, at least you get full set of features for 2-3 years, as opposed to a new version number with a spit-and-polish. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ But you still have to deal with a krApple iPhone. Who wants that other than soccer moms, teeny boppers, "gadget guys" and other the ignorant technophobes who make up the vast majority of iPhoners? Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe you haven't looked at statistics lately, but iPhones are the highest selling mobile devices in the world. So, obviously somebody's buying them... Competitively, how are the Pixel phones doing? 👎🏾 PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ So you believe that something's popularity equates to its inherent higher worth? That's an incredibly juvenile and vapid assumption. Do you also believe that taller beakers always hold more water than shorter ones or that shiny money is always worth more than paper money? :D Knowledgeborn Allah That's not even close to what I said... But yes, if we're being realistic, the iPhone is intrinsically more valuable than the Google Pixel, and every other Android phone for that matter. Why? A lot has to do with hardware and software support. The fact that the Pixel and the iPhone are priced identically, and yet the iPhone (a) holds its resale value for much longer, (b) has a much wider consumer base, and (c) gets supported for much longer by the manufacturer, clearly shows which device has a greater value proposition. Even if we just talk about OEM support for tech devices, that alone puts Apple well ahead of any Android manufacturer. The OnePlus 3T costs around $430 and gets supported for 2 years. That makes the net value for the consumer around $215 per year. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7+ costs around $750 and gets supported for 5 years, making its net value around $150 per year. The iPhone 6s+ still has a general resale value of around $550 or more. Not only is it almost 2 years after since device was released, but that has a higher consumer market resale value than the Google Pixel right now, and that device just came out around 6 months ago! If you honestly think that doesn't say something about its overall value, then what does? Bubba Jones Ah, in my world business users stay with iPhones it is rare to see one with an Android. To make fun of iPhone users calling them ignorant is a sad commentary of yourself. There are plenty of Android users that only know how to make and receive calls, check e-mail, text, that is the extent of their smartphone use. Truly not a bad thing in the least, all it means is that is all they care to know maybe all they need to know. Yes, that include the same demographics you made disparaging remarks of iPhone users. The iPhone may not fit your needs, yet it fits millions upon millions of folks all over this globe. People such as soccer moms, teeny boppers gadget guys, business professionals, military folks, medical practitioners, the legal profession, etc. etc. etc. You are on your high horse, when you step down do be careful where you set foot. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ business users stay with iPhones The only "ignorant" and "sad commentary" here is you believing that "business users" know anything more about technology than the rest of the world. The remainder of your straw man assertions and rebuttals are too tedious to address. Bubba Jones "...The remainder of your straw man assertions and rebuttals are too tedious to address.....", then why did you return a comment? My logical comment must have hit your logic nerve. My reference was not that they know more. Notice that I am stating that the same demographics you disparage for purchasing an iPhone also purchase Android devices. Folks chose the device that best suites them. Also, users migrate between devices as well. Making disparaging comments about folks that chose a device that suites them, but not suites you is a immature thought process. Cellphones are not a religion, political, nor a life and death matter. When someone chooses a device that you do not like do not get your panties in a wad. Their device choice works for them, so be mature thus be happy for them. It is my hope when you are in public, business settings, and with friends and relatives, you do not come across in the same manner about their chosen devices, belittling them and making disparaging remarks as you have here. Instead, in a friendly helpful manner show and explain why Android may better suite them; never ever disparage them. You can do that. EcE ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Borgman I thought it was because Qualcomm stops support for chips after roughly 2 years (for the pixels, 821). So it's not up to Google, but rather QC.

Eclectech well I guess Microsoft wages a little more control over Intel than Google does over Qualcomm. Thomas Larsen Uh no? They're completely unrelated. One platform was mainly used for special embedded products, while the other is made for generic IBM compatible PCs. You still got legacy stuff from the 80's in those bad boys. TheSpaceUnicorn Well, yes, but that's irrelevant because that's not how that works. UtopiaNH Yes, but the primary reason is the architecture of desktop OSes, which have a hardware abstraction layer that mobile OSes do not. This adds overhead that significantly affects the battery life, can cause instability and hardware bricking, and most of all performance of the hardware when the drivers are compiled directly with the OS. Those elements are why no mobile OS is distributed without the primary hardware drivers compiled with the OS, and each of the big three has a different way of handling it. Apple designs their own mobile processors, only supports the limited list of processors and can update the drivers with the OS with no problem. Windows Phone, was distributed with the drivers as part of the OS, which meant microsoft had to wait for Qualcom to release a new processor, then a full release cycle of the OS before support could be added. It meant that every change to hardware, from as basic as a camera, to different button configurations needed to be handled by Windows, rather than the OEMs which slows down iteration of hardware significantly. Google provides the OS uncompiled, and leaves it up to the OEMs to finalize the OS with the drivers needed for each piece of hardware. However, that means both the OEMs, and every single driver provider needs to adjust and test the OS and compile a new update. Since Radios are a major part of all phones, and they affect networks, this adds in an extra layer of the carriers having a say in the devices using those radios, and they can throw a monkey wrench into the process with any device (both windows phone and android suffered this), and the only reason Samsung, Google, and Apple have been able to push OSes without a ton of carrier interference is deals, market power, etc. Windows Phone's advantage of controlling the drivers allowed them to avoid OEM interference, and provide updates, but they couldn't provide them with carrier approval so no OTA updates and had to be downloaded manually, and even still, they end of lifed stuff when Qualcom EOLed them anyway. The only way Google can eliminate this for their own devices is to do what Apple does and design their own processors, and even then they have to still deal with carriers and can end up with stuff like Verizon exclusivity just to be able to distribute their own updates. There are other drivers that can break, but they aren't at the same fundamental level as the SOC is. 4Ui812 Thanks for the detailed explanation 👍 Francois Roy Big OEMs like Google and Samsung could easily negotiate longer support periods from Qualcomm. Support is part of the deals they make. They simply rather keep the money/don't care. Support for 100% Exynos models (Note 2, GS3, GS4) wasn't any longer than the other models at the time. UtopiaNH An OEM actually is disincentivized to provide longer term support since it both costs money, and has low demand from the public perspective, and actually is counterproductive to future sales. Google however is more incentivized due to it not being entirely an OEM, and caring more about the view of the general public for the security of Android, and honestly any deals they make don't fix all the other companies out there still causing issues. Google does not order enough volume from Qualcom to demand or make deals for longer support. In fact part of Google's Nexus team's issues over the years has been fighting over open sourcing the drivers they use for each Nexus device, and Qualcom fought against that pretty damned hard (for example, this is why the Nexus 6 was missing hardware encryption). To me, as an engineering solution it makes more sense to simply make Android more and more modular, so updating the base OS is less and less important and more can be done OTA with no interruption. If they can get Security patches outside the base OS and all system apps outside it, there won't be nearly as much issue or pressure to get any hardware update coordination. Rod Although your post was very informative, I suggest you use more paragraphs. It makes reading way easier. RainMotorsports Android had a HAL. Samsung abstracted the hell out of it's version of Android back in the ice cream sandwich days for exynos hardware. Not sure about any others and or newer versions. They had a major change to the abstraction layer for the radios at one point that locked source built rooms out of using newer modem firmware. destinyhud to put it differently. Intel update their processor more than qualcomm. they are also difference in OS, embedded vs non embedded os 2×4 until google makes their own chip, then they may consider 3+ like Apple Zsolt V Yup, that's what Google should do. Slap a new version number on a gimped update. Dmitry Stepanushkin Are we gonna get another beta testing in hardware? Google better do its job as software company. Suicide_Note Shhh! People don't like facts around these parts when those facts don't support their argument. bekifft Kind of, but Qualcomm will tell you that the OEMs don't support the device longer than two years. And OEMs will tell you Google doesn't support it for more than two years. And Google will tell you Qualcomm doesn't support it for more than two years. And Qualcomm will tell you... someone755 I'm blaming Google. Why in the world would Qualcomm keep supporting hardware when none of their customers are using/supporting it anymore? If Google says "Android phones will live for 2 years", qcom has no incentive to support the devices for any longer. bekifft I tend to agree, Google is the one that can break that cycle, really the only one. Reminds me of Microsoft and Intel back in the day. M. Luciano Google can't break it. Who is Qualcomm going to cater to? Google's 5 million devices per year or Samsung's 50? bekifft You may be right about this actually. But Samsung tried to make their own OS and it didn't work out in phones for them, arguably in anything. Google could change the Android Compatibility Document to apply pressure. I just don't think it's a priority for them, if anything they see it as a good thing, to sell more phones. M. Luciano Google is a tiny OEM. Samsung sells 10x their volume and has been doing so for years. Google is a 9 month old OEM with less than 10 million sales. Qualcomm couldn't give a f less what Google wants for support, at this point. pfmiller I guess you'd be surprised what companies would do for a little extra cash. M. Luciano Which Samsung is giving them, not Google. As soon as Google becomes a major player as an OEM or starts tapping Qualcomm to help with Google's own custom SoC, then Google will have some weight to throw around. someone755 Google is a tiny OEM but a huge company. They dictate how long Android devices should be kept up to date for, because they own Android. M. Luciano "owning" Android doesn't give Google the right to dictate support life-cycles or update schedules to the OEM's. And either way, that doesn't impact Qualcomm. Google only has bargaining power with Qualcomm insofar as their own contract with Qualcomm to supply parts and support for their own devices. Amit_N This is the sole reason why there should not be a monopoly in any market. I really hoped that Intel would succeed which will keep pressure on QC but that hasn't happened yet. Marcelove Yeah, even if Google wanted to change that, it hasn't leverage to do nothing against this scenario right? ? Geoff Johnson Or get mad at Google, who then in turn could require Qualcomm to support it for 3 years instead.... Nathan Bryant The average life of just about any phone is 2 years. Software updates reaching that time and beyond will cripple your device. Phones aren't made to keep working at their best or even at a quality level beyond that. Your performance and battery life will be absolutely​ terrible. iPhones are perfect examples of this. My friend has an iPhone and has stuck with the platform for several years. The newest one is only a pleasurable experience when it first comes out. Going on after a year you start to notice a decline in performance and definitely battery life. Even with their continued updates the device is just crippled. I experienced this with an iPhone before. For all I know it can be a conspiracy as to why phones tap out around that time. I honestly think they're just built to last about that long before needing to purchase a new battery, external battery, or time to upgrade. pfmiller It used to be that upgrading every 2 years made sense since the hardware improvements each year were substantial. That's no longer the case. My N5 still runs quite well. TheSpaceUnicorn I've never felt the experience of an iPhone diminishes so much that getting a new one any sooner than 3 years is worth it. Once you hit the 3 year mark, however, it goes downhill fast. By contrast, most android phones start to feel ancient by the time they turn 2, imo. That said, I have no intention of replacing my Pixel XL until it turns 3, and I won't be missing any major android updates, as I'll just buy the pixel that launches with the first version of android the Pixel XL won't receive (Android Q) Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Its Qualcomms fault. pfmiller I don't really buy that, but even if it's true I don't really care. I'm Google's customer. If Google's suppliers are a problem it's Google's problem to deal with. MisterAlex Eh, they'll realize whatever sales numbers tell them. I didn't want to drop over half a grand on a two-year device; I'll just keep using my Nexus for now. What's the support life on an iOS device? Do those "last" longer? M. Luciano That'll happen as soon as Google starts fabing their own chips. [A]dri[A]n Well Google, Qualcomm and all the OEM's need to sell new products​somehow. Can't do that when you're supporting products for too long. Simple as that. If they just keep on supporting existing devices, people would be more inclined to keep what they already have instead of going out and buying the shiny new stuff. pfmiller If people decide not to buy from them again because Apple has better support that benefits them even less. [A]dri[A]n But that's not gonna happen, so yeah... Haha Android has way too much pull in terms of market share. Marcelove Google already knows that... But people gave happily their butts to the company, so why Google should bother to change the system? ᔕTOᖇᗰ ᔕᑭIᖇIT You hope that from a company who doesn't even know how many messaging apps are 'adequate' to push down our throat. Timmy Turner That's the way it's always been though. Yoann Ferret Well, that's the way it always sucked. Shouldn't they improve that? Sruly J Of course they SHOULD, it's just a matter of if they WILL. EcE There was never any indication it would be improved. John Doe Did you not watch the Pixel announcement? They were bragging about how they control the hardware and software now and it allows them to do things they couldn't before...I guess keeping the phone up to date for longer than 3 years wasn't one LoL EcE Remember how they were bragging about Allo and how awesome it would be? pfmiller This is the first device they put out that they really treated as a "premium" device and a direct competitor to the iPhone. When you hike the price of a product people kind of do expect better support. EcE As I said before and Google is probably saying right now: ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Do I think it's ok? Absolutely not. It matches iPhone's prices, it should match iPhone's support. Watch how long it will take before someone comes and says: "but the Pixel 2 will be the true Google phone, the Pixel never was intended to be a true Google phone". pfmiller It's fine for you to shrug your shoulders, but it's unacceptable to get the same response from Google. They're actually in a position to do something about it. EcE That's the thing though. They have never done anything about it. Take a look at their hardware history, phones, tablets, laptops, OnHub... Again, I don't support this behavior but at this point I don't expect any better from them. Timmy Turner Security wise yes, but OS software wise no. Technology software advances too fast and hardware doesn't age well. Google has to continually improve Android OS as a whole. Just look at how a new software update can crush performance on older iPhones. pfmiller If a phone's hardware is incapable of running the new software that's a legitimate reason to stop upgrading it. Google stops upgrading them well before the hardware is incapable of running the newer versions though. Kiko Eschobar That's assuredly false. The HTC One M7 stopped getting official updates two years ago, but has ROM support up to 7.1.2 with NO hardware performance limitations AT ALL. Google has brainwashed the lot of you into thinking there's compatibility issues when they simply don't feel like putting in the effort software wise. You gonna tell me won't be able to run Android Q without issues? Thomas Larsen Hardware performance != compatibility. Fact of the matter is that Google doesn't have exclusive control over how hardware is supported which does influence officially sanctioned releases. Hackers don't need permission to tinker around. pfmiller Umm, did you actually read what I wrote? Kiko Eschobar Sorry, replied to the wrong guy. I suck at this forum thing... Timmy Turner I agree they do stop support a tad early. For instance I'm sure the Nexus 6 could've easily run the current Nought build yet it's stuck at 7.1.1, sure they have reason. Would be nice to know what it is beyond cost alone for development. Grunty Its almost like it was predictable to everyone but you. Suicide_Note Not sure if you're okay with/upset by this. Hmmm... Corbin Davenport The latter. Duder12 Why dont you guys write about how Qualcomm is fucking this up every year? https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ EcE Now, this is a good idea. I'm sure a certain guy at Ars could do the same. Duder12 Right? If Ars and Android Police did some good research and wrote some big articles on Qualcomm fucking up Android it would be HUGE> bekifft Ron Amadeo did lay this out quite nicely once, but I can't seem to find it. Duder12 Same goes for anyone with a $850 s8+ except much worse. mondeca Samsung doesn't make the OS. Duder12 Youre right but Qualcomm does and they only contribute their drivers for 2 years. cadtek91 Yes they do, well they build it anyway from AOSP. So if Samsung wanted to make an Android O build right now they could. But in two years QC won't be supporting the sd835. Corbin Davenport The Android O Developer Preview isn't in AOSP. Necdet Ali Özdür How is it much worse? Samsung supports it's flagship devices as much as Google does. 2 years of major OS updates and 1 extra year of security patches. It's not good at all, but not much worse either. blenderboy One more thing Google has to do next to be no different than other normal Android manufacturers. Sell the current pixel for half the price when the new pixel comes into market. My expectations of pixel becoming on par with iPhone just went out of the window. They should have at least provide security updates for 5 years. Duder12 Corbin, Read this: https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ james fuston Yes, just like the $94,000 BMW M5 gets the same 4 yr/50,000 mi warranty as a $33,000 BMW 3 series does. You're paying for the hardware, not the support. bekifft But that extra money buys you retail locations with real people, and easy warranty returns, and generally higher quality hardware, and that cool logo on the ba- wait, maybe I'm thinking of someone else... Kevin Davis 😂 lmao. Good one, bud. I was just going to say you went to an Apple Store, until I got to the end of your comment. Marcelove You've accepted be Google's prostitute the day you bought a Dead Pixel... So why are you upset about being fu**ed by the company when you happily gave your ass to it many months ago? My name is…. That why i say pixel is a bad buy Max Johnson Jokes on you to spend $400 for that 5X. Sason Rashidi I'm glad now i didn't get the Pissel Sruly J What about the Pixel? Phil Do you expect to receive updates for longer from any other OEM? Suicide_Note In other words, the Pixels are treated just like Google's other phones. Not sure why anyone expected anything different. I'm fine with this. Dallas King Because it was priced as a flagship? Duder12 Google cant tell Qualcomm what to do. Qualcomm controls the "official" drivers for SOCs . If you didnt notice Qualcomm has a complete monopoly on the SOCs in the US and dictates all terms. When are people going to finally learn this? Sebastian Google can also make reasonable contracts like "I'll buy XX million of your SoC if you support it for at least 4 years." - problem solved. Duder12 Oh is that how it went for you when you did your SOC negotiation with Qualcomm? I didnt realize it was so easy and Qualcomm would be happy to sacrifice future SOC sales that easily. Tell us more. blackice85 Yeah the real fix is for Google to make their own SOC, but as mentioned already that's no simple task. Sebastian Yes, Qualcomm would be sacrificing nearly everything because of the Pixel being the top seller in the Android market... I knew I missed something while writing my first comment... EcE True. But I'm sure they could IF they wanted to. mattcoz Sure they can, they can whip out the checkbook and write down whatever number it takes. Suicide_Note Aaaaaand? i_say_uuhhh I really wished it would be 3 year/4 year security. Duder12 You can thank Qualcomm for this. Santi Ginestet If google had wanted to update the devices 3/4 years, qualcomm would provided the drivers. I'm very sure. Google is so much bigger than qualcomm Duder12 Have you ever heard of small non existent companies suing huge corporations due to patents? Qualcomm has the patents. Qualcomm has the power. Santi Ginestet Motorola too........ But anyway, they are working together Google and Qualcomm right? Duder12 Qualcomm updates their drivers for 2 years and there is no if and or but about it. If they supported longer it would hurt sales for them since that means less handset sales down the road. They control all the radio patents in the US which are bundled with the processor and gpu. Santi Ginestet Ok i saw it: https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ May be you were right... Santi Ginestet Then a new argument is out, what happens with mediatek devices and updates? Duder12 Pixels dont use mediatek because they CANT. Santi Ginestet I KNOW! I WASN'T TALKING about google pixel devices, i was talking about any mediatek device, i'm sure it hasn't got 2 years of updates. Duder12 Than your argument belongs in a different article Xchris That's fine with me. I'll be getting the pixel XL 2 anyway Duder yeah me too Santi Ginestet And i will buy the "old" pixel 1 to people like you! Jajaja marcusmarcus2 Google be like https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnt8Thwuy7Pr8EU/giphy.gif Dallas King "... it also means that the company is sticking to its two-year version/three-year security updates promise." Yeah, we'll see about that. Hopefully, but I'm not holding my breath. Sruly J @corbin_davenport:disqus Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there talk for a while that Google is working on their own processor, and if they do come out with one and use it for future devices, it would enable them to support devices for longer? Duder12 yes and yes but not this year. Sruly J Yeah, probably should have mentioned that, although considering when those reports came out, and how long something like this could take, I figured it was a given not this year. ;) Corbin Davenport There were rumors, but I don't recall if they had any credibility. Duder12 Google has already said on record last fall that the Pixel gives them that opportunity. That tells you they are at least trying to make it happen. 9To5Google reports on this stuff. I dont get why AndroidPolice doesnt seem to know much about this topic. Corbin Davenport Having the opportunity to develop SoCs in-house and actually working towards that are two separate things. Duder12 It was a very promising statement. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-04/behind-the-pixel-google-s-first-real-threat-to-apple-s-iphone Also, read this about qualcomm's lack of SOC support: https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ Sir_Brizz I think Qualcomm is in "turning a tanker" territory at this point. We all know it's mostly their fault. Thomas Larsen Think there were rumours of them hiring some hardware people, but it's not even that simple, getting their own silicon out would be a pretty massive undertaking. Sruly J Of course it's not simple, especially since something like that could (and would) shake things up (and not necessarily for the better). ASense0fPurpose "No[t] guaranteed..." https://i.imgur.com/mUI1Huo.jpg Xavier Don't iOS devices typically see around 5 years support? Android Police should be more aggressive about coaxing Google (and other flagship manufacturers) to do the same instead of just singing the same old mantra all the time. 3 years support is ok if it's a cheap device, but in the same price range as an iPhone that sort of lousy support should steer people away from Android. Mark McCoskey That's the thing I like about Apple. They update all of their devices. Wish there was a way to update any device I own with pure Android. Cakefish *2 years support. David Thoren Then I guess we can't really count Apple's support as 5 years because they don't typically allow the older devices to have all of the newest features. Bob Marley It's usually due to hardware reasons. Cakefish My iPad Air 2 has all the features of iOS 10.3. Only lacks 3D Touch for obvious reasons. Sachin Bahal They sort-of do, but have you used like an iPhone 5 with iOS 9 or 10, you'll notice that it becomes unbearably slow or what iOS users called "iOS slow", this is partly for planned obsolescence, there's no real proof that Apple is doing that on purpose http://globalnews.ca/news/2926170/is-apple-guilty-of-using-planned-obsolescence-to-force-iphone-users-into-upgrading/ Sir_Brizz I don't disagree with this point, personally, however I will say that if Google is trying to position themselves as a competitor to Apple in this arena, they have to be able to compete with Apple. They need to get to 5 years of support, even if it's not on major versions (but it would be easier for them to just support major versions). Xavier Great point about maybe just providing security updates for 5 years. Can't expect Google to keep providing new features for old devices, but should expect to continue secure usage after three years without being a whiz. Miguel Angel My iPhone 5S runs just fine. But it is about a year old. Once you own a device for 3+ years that's when things start to wear down regardless of software. But still it would be great to get 3 years of support instead of 2. Mark McCoskey Google really should extend their OS support to 3-4 years, instead of just 2. Most people don't need a new phone every 2 years. Only those who are hard on their devices, and those who chase new technology. destinyhud i used my nexus 4 for 3 years. I was always on the latest version of the OS for that 3 years. There was this 1 month whe i was waiting for my nexus 6p to show up and thats when i was one version behind. but sure 3 years is not going to hurt either Mark McCoskey Still using my 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6. Waiting to find out what "Taimen" is, or whether an US Android One will be released. james fuston > and those who chase new technology That's kind of the name of the game. Every major US carrier tries to get you to trade in your phone after 12 months for an upgrade. Making money is the entire point of the spec race in smartphone manufacturing. thereasoner You can stay up to date for 3 years/OS versions and securty patches continue into year 4 of the Pixels life. More than enough for most I'm thinking but resale value would improve if a 4th OS version was made available. Thing is, how will the phone perform at that point? Those iPhones that get that old have been known to slow down considerably. mattcoz You don't need to update every 2 years, you'll still be on the latest release through the 3rd year. If you're someone who doesn't have the desire to upgrade after 3 years, you likely don't care that much about being on the latest version of Android anyway. It's not like the phone will stop working. Knowledgeborn Allah Google launched the Pixel to directly compete with the iPhone. That's why the two devices are priced the same. So, given that agenda, why doesn't Google also match the support that Apple gives the iPhone? 2 years of OS updates is pretty ridiculous in 2017, seeing how powerful modern devices are getting. Just to compare the 2 platforms, keep in mind that the iPhone 5 is going to get updated to iOS 10.3.2 when it officially gets released, and the iPhone 5s is getting updated to iOS 11 this summer. Meanwhile, the Nexus 6 is beyond its EOL mark. Let that sink in. Naxx ENVY it sunk in.. feels bad .. can i un-sink it ? Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, un-sink it... 😂😂😂 DKS Funny, I didn't read about this policy on Google's sustainability PR page -- environment.google Theuntje Google.. I love you.. but be more like Apple in terms of updating your phones PANDAMONIUM🚀 I thought Google already did EOD on the Pixel line up, they're pretty difficult to purchase. /s Trysta I know there is some debate as to who exactly is responsible for this. But regardless this sucks. At the very least the 2 years support clock should start the very last day that Google has the pixels for sale. Considering how hard it is to actually purchase these phones, one should be guaranteed 2 years of full support regardless of when they were able to purchase. But obviously that is fantasy, this is reality, and I will continue to wonder if I could survive with an iPhone. Sir_Brizz I don't think it's all that debatable... it's mostly Qualcomm's fault, but partially Google's. mattcoz In reality, the end result would be exactly the same. Whether it's 2 years from release or 2 years from 10 months after release, the latest update you would get is still P. TechGuy22 fuck that better sell my pixel XL before i lose all my money Siddharth Just cant get more excited for all the bugs that would hit the Pixel/XL with Android O and Android P! Adam Hunter Security patches are more important than OS updates. It's good to see Google committing to 3 years for security patches. create812 I can barely hold out for two full years before upgrading anyway. The hardware improvements usually tip the scale for me. Masklayer So... my $30 Windows phone has been supported longer...? PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan It has but Windows Mobile is abbomination and even Microsoft stopped taking it seriously. Virtually all android apps from MS are better than win apps even for desktop. Masklayer k . TechGuy22 i'm sure the phone can update until 2030 but hey, they gonna sell new phones Sir_Brizz No compromises device comparable to the iPhone. 4Ui812 I thought the Fixel was on life support since it's release. Wasn't that why Google kept trying to fix the problems with it ? Jesse Lee Root your damn phones already and run a custom ROM software that includes all the Google updates!! It's your phone, run what you want on it already and STFU Naxx ENVY you mean ,.. run what you want from other developers .. or are you saying we should learn how to code so we can make and port android version to our phones? dur., xtess3ractx Google should really flex some muscle here along with the other OEMs and extend the period by at least a year. An additional 2(4 years total) would be great. Cael Qualcomm wants to sell new chips whispy_snippet Until batteries have significantly better battery longevity it matters little. What good is an up to date phone if you need to charge it every few hours? This is one area where Samsung is taking the lead with their new S8 battery. We'll see if it delivers on the promise, but it's a good aim to have. Jay That argument is irrelevant in parts of the world like Asia. You can walk into a phone repair store, put down 30 usd and walk out with a new battery in an hour. You get get a lot of parts for your phone replaced and half the price that it costs in the u.s. and uk. People keep their phones. whispy_snippet Ok, sure, but that's a non-official work around that likely voids one's warranty immediately. Correct? In theory, you could keep replacing batteries for a decade or more. By extension, your logic implies a phone OEM should provide software support indefinitely. This isn't realistic. I'm not saying Google and others shouldn't commit to longer software support. But given Android phones consist of so many hardware variations it makes ongoing support almost impossible. Apple have the advantage here in that they have tighter control of their hardware meaning they can commit to longer software support. I don't see any of this changing for the broader Android ecosystem any time soon. Google, on the other hand, is probably looking at designing its own chips for the Pixel to help bridge the software update gap to Apple and the iPhone. boop "Ok, sure, but that's a non-official work around that likely voids one's warranty immediately. Correct?" If your phone's in-warranty, get the battery replaced by the issuer. 2 years out, it's likely out of warranty in which case there's nothing to void. "Google, on the other hand, is probably looking at designing its own chips" In the Chromebook space, minimum 6.5 year lifespan (and likely still updated indefinitely afterward), they cooperate with SoC manufacturers to maximize performance in crOS under the [optional] OP1 brand. While I doubt Google would make their own, it's possible OP1 SoCs could find their way to Android phones. whispy_snippet "If your phone's in-warranty, get the battery replaced by the issuer. 2 years out, it's likely out of warranty in which case there's nothing to void." That's a fair point. But my other key point still stands - it's hard for Google and other OEM's to offer software support as long as a company like Apple given the variations in hardware out there running Android. pfmiller Google isn't supporting every hardware variation that Android runs on, they're only supporting the devices they ship. Same as Apple. Jay We aren't talking warranty. We're talking replacing your battery which will allow you to keep your device a little longer. I see your point. You could also stop into a Sony, Huawei, Samsung Etc and get your battery officially replaced by them as well.

Is google just lazy or there is another reason? PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Follow the trend of big boys like Sammy Miguel Angel Google would need their SOC. It's unfortunate Samsung didn't care to update their phones besides having their own. mattcoz That's plenty, that's 3 years being on the latest release and up to date with security. sebastianer I think 5 years would be plenty...but 2.....is less than ok. mattcoz It's really 3 years, it'll get O and P and get security updates until the release of Q and the Pixel 4. Although I think they really should extend security updates past that, gotta keep your stragglers safe. SomeGuy112 It's said this at the bottom of the Pixels official spec page ever since they took pre-orders for the phone. https://madeby.google.com/phone/specs/ BehemothPL I only came here for comments. Btw, it's available in Play Store (well, it was yesterday). Mike What do the Pixel fans have to say ? BTW I'm loving the Galaxy S8+! Naxx ENVY the galaxy s8 gets even less support... that's what they saying LOL Mike Delevopment for Samsung phones are strong on XDA . Too bad I cant say the same for Pixel and Nexus phones. UniBroW Zero chance I'll drop 700+ on a phone that isn't going to see 5 years of updates or at least two once they stop selling them. I do not care what the reason is, it's inexcusable in 2017 and especially for someone that had the clout such as Google e_hekuta Please Google, design a Google SoC to Pixel 3, with 3 years of Android OS Updates :'( Or together with the other manufacturers convince($) to qualcomm to change the polyce of 2 years of guaranted updates, at least in high ends SoCs (835/845) tansuperman This is why people switch to iphone tansuperman All the arguments make no sense. Apple supports their phones, not the soc chop makers they use. wittyname9000 I'm sorry but two years of official OS updates on a device that is as expensive as the Pixel is a bummer. If a ragtag group of dev(s) over at XDA can get things working on much older hardware then Google needs to get it done. Just my two cents. David If you guys don't like that Google doesn't support their devices like Apple then don't buy their phones. It's not going to change anytime soon so you aren't doing anything by complaining about it. I change my phone every year so it doesn't bother me. username_not_valid People keep saying 'blame Qualcomm', but how is it then that lineage/CM ROMS pop up with newer OS versions? Are they using older drivers? If so then it seems like the older drivers work fine. I grant you, often Lineage/CM isnt the most stable thing, but then again its not Google, who should in theory do a better job.

Its business model is a 2-year planned obsolescence. Google's got fuck all control over it. Premsuraj Absolutely pathetic considering the price. Hate to say it but at this price people are better off buying an iPhone NavyVeteran Pixel XL 2 better be over 5.8" or its a no go. 5.5" phones are uncivilized. The 6 inch Nexus 6, aka Shamu was perfect. Still have mine. Morjesta! Its all business, shorter support time span, end-users will upgrade to newer phones. It's not profitable that and end-user keep using a phone for more than 2 years. It's like the urban legend, that says that Apple on its updates, decreases performance on older phones, forcing users to get new ones, even if they are still functional. ericshmerick Uh, Apple is absolutely king here as hard as that is to say. It's no contest if you want to keep your phone for many years. Yes I understand how they are able to do this (i.e. hardware control). Google needs to hop on this with it's Pixel line. Hussain Ahmadi Just another proof that google sucks! Hopefully this year I am switching back to Samsung. Samsung also offers 2 years of update and added to this I am getting a phone that is designed well and its screen looks amazing with tons of options rather than the sepia screens of google which are covered by a huge bezel! Miguel Angel This is not fair, Google needs to do something about Qualcomm and bump it up to 3 years of software support. My old iPhone 5s still gets updates. It's unfortunate the best Android choice for updates doesn't go beyond 2 years for non security updates. And no I don't want to rely on XDA ROMs. Tolgay Günay Google said already their Devices get always 2 Years Support, not longer. God Thanks i haven't switched to Pixel. Nexus 6P for life. Groud Frank At this point I see absolutely no advantage of, say, getting a Pixel XL over a Galaxy Note 8 besides quick updates. Samsung has better hardware and far more useful software. I went from Note 3 to Nexus 6 and I wasn't all that impressed. It's a great phone, besides the painfully slow camera, but I fell for and got disappointed by the 'stock android is so much better' meme. linuxdood um, its not going to last forever?

Honolulu, United States - April 27, 2017 /PressCable/ -- Marketing Advertising Promotion Services Hawaii, a Hawaii marketing agency, launched a wide range of updated services for clients looking to grow their businesses and attract more customers. More information can be found at https://marketingadvertisingpromotionserviceshawaii.com. Online marketing has seen a tremendous growth in recent years, with more and more businesses looking for effective strategies to leverage the immense marketing potential of the internet. The vast majority - over 90% - of all consumers use online resources to find business information, making online visibility crucial for overall business success. The constant growth in the demand for professional digital marketing services has led to the appearance of many agencies providing a wide range of such solutions. SEO has become especially popular, as Google is the most common point of contact between businesses and consumers. However, Google algorithm updates make it increasingly difficult for any SEO agency to provide a quick solution for local businesses, making such services significantly less reliable than most claim to be. Marketing Advertising Promotion Services Hawaii is a digital marketing agency using a wide range of sustainable strategies to provide solid business growth for clients in Honolulu and the rest of Hawaii. The main goal of the agency is to work closely with each client to identify the most effective digital marketing strategy, rather than providing standard services that might not yield optimal results. The Honolulu agency uses a wide range of digital marketing resources, including professional copywriting, press release writing and distribution, social media marketing and many others. All these strategies are part of the agency's efforts to provide effective, reliable and ethical services to each individual business. Marketing Advertising Promotion Services strives to provide fully-customized services for each client business. As a result, the number of clients it can work with at any time is limited. Interested parties can find more information by visiting the above-mentioned website.

GOOG, +3.63% GOOGL, +3.71% Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said Thursday that his company has taken "significant steps" to address advertisements appearing on controversial videos on YouTube, owned by Google-parent Alphabet. YouTube came under fire from brands this March after their advertisements had appeared alongside inappropriate content. Google has drawn upon machine learning and other technical solutions to prevent the issue from happening in the future, Pichai said. The company is still in its early stages of combating the issue, but Pichai said it has "made progress." "Advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements that we've made," Pichai said, later adding that Google had made "thousands and thousands" of calls to advertisers in the past few weeks. Shares of Alphabet were up 4% late Thursday, following the company's first-quarter earnings beat.

More videos A record year for the world's richest Gina Rinehart was one of many billionaires who saw their fortunes increase dramatically in the last 12 months according to Forbes magazine. That marks his third straight year getting nine-figure pay - a rare accomplishment even at well-paying technology companies and virtually unheard of in other industries. Since he became CEO in 2015, Pichai has moved to give Google more control over two critical fields: artificial intelligence and cloud. Related Content Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results Is a CEO worth $260m? Shareholders at this company think so He oversaw a 17.8 per cent jump in Google's core ads business last year, while also boosting its revenue in cloud and hardware, a long-sought goal of the company. Pichai's 2016 compensation consisted mainly of 273,328 Class C shares that vest quarterly through 2019 if he remains on the job. Advertisement The award was granted about six months after the tech business announced it would reorganise into holding company Alphabet. As part of the transition, Pichai was tapped to lead Google, taking the reins from Larry Page who became chief executive of the parent entity. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link It is the third-straight year Sundar Pichai has received a nine-figure salary. Photo: Michael Short It wasn't the first time that following in Page's footsteps led to big payouts for Pichai. In 2015, he got about $US100 million in reported compensation after he was promoted to senior vice-president of products and took over many of Page's responsibilities overseeing areas such as search and ad products. That made him one of the highest-paid US executives that year, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. His biggest pay package that can be gleaned from filings came in 2014. He got 442,424 shares worth about $US250 million in August that year, shortly before his promotion. The stock will be fully vested in 2018. Since Alphabet wasn't required to disclose his compensation at the time, filings don't reveal why he received such a large grant. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the award. Alphabet also didn't disclose any salary or cash bonus paid to Pichai in 2014. The California-based company typically grants equity awards to top bosses once every two years, a strategy it has said "encourages executives to take a long-term view of the business". Chief financial officer Ruth Porat got a $US39.1 million pay package for 2016, most of it in a stock award that vests through 2019. Bloomberg 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

A true disruptive technology, which shakes up an existing industry (think Apple in music or mobile or Uber in the taxi business) or dominates an entirely new one (think Facebook or Google), is the Holy Grail for investors. But of all the disrupters, two companies—technological innovator Amazon.com AMZN, +0.72%   and financial services provider Vanguard—have had the biggest impact on established industries that employ millions of people. Both have been big winners at key inflection points where online retailing and passive, low-cost investing became the new paradigms. Amazon planned for that for years, while Vanguard was ahead of its time perhaps initially and then in the right place at the right time. Importantly, Amazon, though one of the biggest public companies, couldn’t care less about quarterly earnings, while Vanguard, which is owned by its funds, isn’t even public. That has let both companies build their businesses for the long haul free of Wall Street’s greedy meddling. Amazon may disrupt several industries, from brick-and-mortar retail to shipping. Annual revenue has increased nearly 12-fold since 2006, to $136 billion in 2016. It’s the fourth most valuable U.S. company, with a market capitalization of $435 billion, its share price having risen 50% over the past 12 months. CEO Jeff Bezos is now the second-wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $75.6 billion as of March 29. That wealth was built on innovation, operational genius and extraordinary attention to customers’ needs. Amazon has launched products like the Kindle, Echo, and Alexa, and sold them aggressively. It keeps pushing the envelope on shipping time—it’s experimented with drones and one-to-two-hour delivery. It’s developed a video service that’s competitive with Netflix and has produced original television shows and motion pictures, like Oscar winner “Manchester by the Sea”. Its lucrative Amazon Prime service may have 80 million subscribers. It dominates public cloud computing. Amazon, which earns half of all dollars spent online, is the leading culprit in the Retail Apocalypse. In the first quarter of 2017, 14 retail chains have announced they’re seeking bankruptcy protection. Retail consultant Walter Loeb calculates nearly 3,600 U.S. retail outlets will close this year. Amazon may top Macy’s M, -0.98%   in apparel sales this year, is opening several experimental bricks-and-mortar stores, and is even selling groceries. The company employs 341,000 people in full- and part-time (many of them low paid) positions and plans to hire 100,000 more. My MarketWatch colleague Rex Nutting calculates that Amazon could kill two million American jobs — more than China did. You can’t get more disruptive than that. Vanguard was a great innovator when it launched in 1975, and since then it’s stuck to the philosophy of low-cost, mostly index investing formulated by its founder, John C. Bogle. Lately, it has become the dominant force in retail investing while making big inroads into the institutional market. In the last three years, The New York Times reported, investors put $823 billion into Vanguard funds vs. a net $97 billion for the other 4,000 fund firms. So more than eight times as much money went to Vanguard as to everybody else. The firm’s assets under management (AUM) have quadrupled over the past seven years and now exceed $4 trillion, second only to BlackRock. Vanguard has been the chief beneficiary of a sea change in investing, accelerated by the rise of exchange traded funds, where it also is runner-up to BlackRock. Index funds now comprise 40% of total U.S. equity fund assets, double their percentage a decade ago (although a quarter of Vanguard’s assets are actively managed). “It’s completely been an outcome rather than a goal,” Jamey Delaplane, a principal in Vanguard’s Retail Investor Group, told me. “We are not doing new and different things to try to grow faster or bigger, absolutely not. We are trying to be very, very focused on the client.” Vanguard’s whole brand equity is being the low-cost provider. “Vanguard continues to do what they do, which is cut costs, cut costs, cut costs, and they’ve been very good at marketing the notion—rightly—that lower costs accrue to the investors,” said Dan Wiener, chairman and CEO of Adviser Investments, which manages more than $4 billion and invests in Vanguard funds. Wiener says the rapid growth has taken its toll—he’s gotten lots of complaints from Vanguard customers about poor service. “They forgot that they needed to invest in infrastructure, invest in people,” he told me. Delaplane acknowledged Vanguard has seen “a slight uptick” in client complaints recently, but said it’s “a very, very small share of our overall client base.” Still, Vanguard plans to hire 2,000 more people in 2017 (it has 16,000 employees now) and it’s also investing heavily in systems and technology—a tacit admission of some growing pains. That’s a good problem to have. As Vanguard and Amazon show, it’s better to be a shark than a minnow. Howard R.

EZVIZ Mini 360 Plus review: An adorable 360-degree camera, but a little light on features Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/29 12:35pm PDTApr 29, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares59 Camera Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design and setup 5 Video and audio 6 App and features 7 Conclusion Everyone and their mother seems to be making a stationary home security camera these days, but there are also an increasing number of 360-degree cameras. These small motorized units might a preferable option, depending on what you need to keep an eye on. I tested the Yi Dome Camera a few months ago and found it to be overall pretty neat, but perhaps a little gimmicky. Lately, I've been using the EZVIZ Mini 360 Plus, which is very similar to the Yi 360. It's a low-cost camera that can rotate to get a full 360-degree view of the room. The Mini 360 Plus is a touch cheaper than many home security cameras, and the design is cool. However, it lacks some of the features you get with more expensive cameras, and the image quality is just okay. I can forgive some of that because the Mini 360 Plus also happens to be a cute little device. Specs Camera 1080p Field of View 92-degrees Night Vision Infrared Audio Microphone, speaker Power AC only Connectivity 2.4GHz WiFi Local storage Yes Measurements 100x100x90mm, 220g Cloud storage 7-days $5/month, 30-days $10/month The Good Price Only $80 for a 1080p security camera. Design It's a cute little camera. Rotation You can see the entire room, if positioned well. Includes motion tracking, too. Night vision Very bright IR light. Local storage There's a microSD card slot for local video storage without a cloud plan. The Not So Good Video The field of view is only 92-degrees, and images look too compressed Panoramas Despite having a rotating design, you can't capture 360-degree images for general use. Notifications Not enough options. No geofencing, SMS, audio triggers, or email. Rotation again Controls are a bit clunky, and there's no way to have the camera scan around continuously. App Confusing layout and occasional bugs. Plans No free tier, so it's either a subscription or all local storage. Design and setup One of my favorite things about the Mini 360 Plus is the design. It's a small globe about 4-inches across with a flat bottom so it can remain stable on a table or shelf. You can also mount it to the ceiling via an included bracket. The video output can be flipped 180-degrees to compensate, but there's no other rotation option. That means placing it on a wall is not recommended. The housing has a two-tone color scheme—the top half with the lens is black, and the bottom is white. It looks slick. The top half of the camera is the part that rotates to give you a view of the room. The setup process for the camera is one of the quickest I've seen, with only a few weird moments. I'm not overly pleased with the power cable, though. Most cameras have moved to a microUSB cable for power, but the Mini 360 Plus has a rather weird cable. It's a USB-A at the wall adapter end, but the other end is a DC jack. So, you'll have to run a new cable if you're replacing another camera with the Mini 360 Plus. There's also no battery like you'd find in more expensive cameras. Next to the power jack is a microSD card slot, which can be used to record all your video locally. Not all cameras support this, but I certainly appreciate those that do. After powering up, you can install the EZVIZ app and create an account. I'll give EZVIZ points for supporting Google account login. After you have tied your accounts together, you can log into EZVIZ apps and services via Google. That's handy considering the app has a weird habit of logging me out. The only bump in the road during setup is the email code to confirm the account; mine took several minutes to show up. The camera is added by scanning the QR code on the underside, and then you get to choose how you're connecting it to your network. It supports WiFi, but there's also an ethernet port, which is a nice extra you don't see on most home cameras. If you do WiFi (as most people will) you have to hold your phone within 2-inches of the camera, which is pretty weird. That's apparently necessary to push the WiFi credentials over to the camera. Be aware, if you use WiFi this camera only supports 2.4GHz. Video and audio The Mini 360 Plus has both 720p and 1080p video, and interestingly it defaults to 720p mode. Only when you venture into the settings can you change that to full HD. I think, probably, that's because the 1080p mode comes with a major trade-off. The Mini 360 Plus only records and streams at 15 frames per second in 1080p mode. In 720p it can do 30 fps. This camera can pan and rotate all the way around, which is good because you'll need that to see an entire room. The Mini 360 Plus has a rather narrow 92-degree field of view. Even other rotating cameras like the Yi Dome Cam are wider than that. There's very little distortion at the edges of the frame, which is one upshot of the narrow FOV, I guess. The image clarity is okay in 1080p video mode. I've seen better image quality from other cameras, and I'd probably say it's not worth using full HD mode on this camera considering the lower frame rate. It doesn't look considerably clearer—in fact, all the images look rather compressed. I will give the Mini 360 Plus high marks for night vision. It has a brighter IR light than most cameras, and it flips on quickly when the lights go out. The camera's audio quality is similarly just okay. You can speak through the camera using your phone by pressing and holding the intercom button. Voices come through the speaker a bit crackly, but you can understand what's being said. The microphone gets the job done, but it too is crackly and not very loud. App and features The EZVIZ app can handle all the company's cameras, so you can manage the Mini 360 Plus along with the company's more conventional fixed cameras. The main screen shows you all the cameras you have connected to your account. Tapping on them goes to the control interface where you can view the feed larger and see the video history. The app is responsive, but the design is generally confusing. Features are scattered around, and the camera controls are odd. For example, there are two different rows of controls under the feed, one of which is scrollable. There's no rhyme or reason to which buttons are where, and none of them are labeled. The bottom half of the screen provides quick access to the recorded clips and a timeline view. This part of the app actually works quite well.   Despite having a full 360-degree view of the room, you can't just take a 360-degree photo (as far as I can tell). The only place this functionality is supported is in the pan interface. The camera stitches together a panoramic photo, and then you tap on different areas to rotate the camera there. Alternatively, there's a trackpad-like interface for moving the camera. It works alright, but the delay after dragging makes it hard to get the camera pointed where you want. One of my most serious concerns with this device is the relative lack of notification and recording options. There's no geofencing, SMS, or email. The camera saves every video for every movement in its field of view (there is sensitivity adjustment), and you can't use sound as a trigger at all. There is at least a scheduling feature that can disable notifications, although the video is still recorded. Additionally, it can't be set to pan around continuously . The only automatic movement you get is motion tracking, but you might miss something moving in the room with the narrow FOV and no automatic panning. Like all the companies looking to sell you a home security camera, EZVIZ encourages you to sign up for a cloud storage subscription plan. $5 per month gets you 7-days of saved video, and $10 monthly is 30-days of storage. Unfortunately, there's no online storage at all if you don't pay for it. Many camera makers are at least offering a couple of days free, but here you have to rely on the microSD card. Conclusion I can't deny there are issues with the Mini 360 Plus—the image and sound quality are just okay, and the feature set is lacking. However, it has good night vision, attractive design, and a low price. EZVIZ Mini 360 Plus with the Yi Dome Camera At $80, this is one of the cheapest home security cameras available. Plus, it rotates. I just wish the app could take better advantage of the hardware. If you're looking for a budget camera, I think the Yi Dome Camera is a little better. However, you should spend more if you can. The "premium" camera systems have many more features. Tags cameras ezviz Mini 360 Plus security cameras wifi security camera subscribe ...

I'd also like to recommend the Ezviz Mini (no 360, no plus). Amazon generally has these anywhere between 50-60 USD, which is the lowest I've seen for something like this.Setup, app use, storage/cloud features, etc are all identical to this review, and the only real differences are that it is only 720p, but has a 130 degree camera, which to me completely makes up for the lack of rotation. I'd love a Nest just to integrate more with my thermostat and other things, but I can get 3 of these for the cost of 1 nest, so I have them all around my house now. I also like that you have to scan each camera's QR code when you login to the app on a new phone before it will show you the video. If you're putting cameras around your house it's nice to know anyone can't just log in as you on the app and start spying.

Arriving later this year, the new digital adventure will pave the way for more VR-exclusive programs. We dive into the details below. Best Buy smartphones – experience virtual reality for yourself on a top-notch mobile Behind the glass at London’s Natural History Museum As part of its growing interest in the future of VR entertainment, Sky has announced plans for an interactive series starring iconic broadcaster David Attenborough. The new Hold the World show will give viewers the chance to explore the Natural History Museum, letting them hold up and peer inside ancient artifacts from around the world. They’ll be accompanied on their journey by a three-dimensional hologram of Attenborough himself. This isn’t the first time that Sky has shown an interest in VR. Last year, we reported on the launch of the Sky VR app, which creative director Richard Nockles said was the ‘first step on Sky’s very special VR journey’. The Hold the World show will be available through the free Sky VR app for smartphones – allowing anyone with a virtual reality headset to get involved. The TV giant is yet to reveal whether or not it’ll be for subscribers only, but considering all of the existing content on the app is free, we expect there will be a demo to try out at the very least. The upcoming experience won’t arrive until later this year, but in the mean time the free Sky VR app for iOS and Android has something to offer. Sports fans have a film on Anthony Joshua to take a look at, and elsewhere there’s a thrilling Star Wars scene for movie buffs. Watch 360-degree videos from Planet Earth II If you were a fan of the BBC’s Planet Earth II series on TV, you might want to explore the free selection of 360-degree clips from the show that are available online. Over on the Planet Earth II website, you’ll see experiences including a tour of the African grasslands at night and a walk through the Costa Rican jungle. Each video can be viewed with or without a virtual reality headset, and they’re all accessible through YouTube on a computer too. How to watch virtual reality on your smartphone You don’t need to spend much to enjoy the impression of virtual reality. If you want to try out a headset for the first time, we recommend Google Cardboard for iOS and Android. It’s a cardboard VR viewer (as the name suggests) that you have to assemble yourself, and it’s £15 from Google’s own store. Once built, you simply slot your phone into the headset and hold it up to your eyes. If you shop around for third-party alternatives on eBay, you can grab a clone for as little as 99p. If you’re a little more serious about VR, Samsung sells its own dedicated headset, the Gear VR. It costs around £60, but is more responsive to your head movements compared to budget-priced alternatives. It works with the Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, Note 5, S6, S6 Edge and S6 Edge+. Samsung has told us that the new Galaxy S8 will be getting its own, controller-supported VR headset ‘in the coming weeks’. Visit our Samsung mobile phone reviews page for in-depth tests of its range of smartphones. Competing against the Gear VR is the Daydream View. You can grab one from Carphone Warehouse for £70, which gets you the headset and a Daydream controller. Using a controller means you can ‘walk’ around a virtual world using your hand while you turn your head to look around at the same time. The headset works best with ‘Daydream-ready phones’, which includes the Pixel and Pixel XL. To see how both smartphones performed in our lab, see our Google Pixel review and Google Pixel XL review. A top-of-the-range smartphone isn’t vital for VR, however. With generic headsets like Google Cardboard, all of the models listed in our guide on the best cheap mobile phones are compatible. The latest smartphones put to the test To experience virtual reality in all its glory, you’ll want a smartphone with a crystal-clear screen, impressive audio and solid battery life. Only the smartphones that are a joy to use on a daily basis do enough to earn our Best Buy title. Meanwhile, Don’t Buy smartphones are slow to respond when running multiple apps at once, and die far quicker than they should. To see which smartphones from the likes of Apple, Samsung and Huawei have impressed in our lab, see our smartphone reviews page.

Written by: Vicky Nanjappa Updated: Monday, May 1, 2017, 7:32 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News For 12 year old Puja Khaudia Google came in handy to track down her parents after she had gone missing in 2010. A resident of Jagatsinghpur district in Odisha, Puja went missing in 2010 and was raised for seven years at a childcare home in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh. She had visited Puri along with her parents in 2010 and it was there that she went missing. At the childcare home she searched for places of famous temples on Google and came across the Puri Jagannath temple. As her memory revived, the girl informed the institute and the local childcare personnel took up the matter with Nellore police prompting them to bring it to the notice of its counterparts in Puri. After a check of old missing file cases, police found a missing case registered by a couple from Nimapada area in Puri district. Investigators later found that the couple had shifted from Nimapara to Jagatsinghpur in 2011. The missing case was cracked after the couple was located. Old family photos were shared with Nellore institute which in turn shared Puja's childhood picture. The parents recognised their missing daughter while the girl also identified her parents, Swain said. The Andhra Pradesh police brought the girl and got her reunited with her parents Shyam Khaudia and Muni Khaudia after completing legal formalities on Saturday.

Forums Join   Analyst Predicts Dish, T-Mobile & Amazon Super Union by Karl Bode Friday Apr 28 2017 10:00 EDT Dish has been hoovering up spectrum for years, and just nabbed another $6.2 billion in spectrum at the 600 MHz auction. And while there's a growing consensus on some fronts that Dish boss Charlie Ergen is just spectrum squatting ahead of an inevitable sale, there's another segment of analysts that believe Dish is on the cusp of a new cross-industry mega-deal that may just ramp up overall wireless competition. Over at his blog, wireless industry analyst Tim Farrar sees a three-way tie up between T-Mobile, Amazon and Dish as a likely outcome. According to Farrar, previous talks between Dish, Google and T-Mobile to build an LTE Advanced network have broken down, in part because Google has scaled back its broadband ambitions and has shifted its attention to more experimental wireless options. That may have forced Dish to "A three way partnership between Dish, Amazon and T-Mobile therefore seems to me to be the single most likely deal to emerge in the next few weeks. T-Mobile has emphasized its desire for a rapid build out of its large block of new spectrum, and it could easily include a buildout of DISH’s incentive auction spectrum at the same time. Amazon could use the capacity not only for in-home services such as Echo, but also to support other activities such as drone deliveries, while DISH could provide wireless service built around Sling TV, as well as fixed wireless broadband if desired." While the most common theory seems to be that Dish will simply sell its spectrum to Verizon and AT&T, Farrar shoots down that theory. "Verizon and AT&T have their sights set on mmWave spectrum and 5G, so neither seems like a potential buyer of DISH’s spectrum, while Comcast appears determined to rely on its MVNO deal with Verizon after only buying 5x5MHz of spectrum in the incentive auction," he notes.Of course Ergen has a long-standing reputation as being incredibly difficult to deal with in negotiations, meaning it's still entirely possible that no deal happens and Dish still cashes out (and Verizon has expressed interest in Dish's spectrum several times). Most industry players were blocked from communicating as per anti-collusion rules affixed to the recent spectrum auction. But those rules expired yesterday, opening the doors to what's expected to be a flood of new M&A speculation under Trump, be it a Sprint/T-Mobile merger or some other, broader combination. tags: competition · business · wireless · alternatives · bandwidth · consumers · T-Mobile · Dish Network · Amazon News Jump Report: Average Cable Bill May Top $140 By 2020Forum Topic: Suddenlink Ramps up Annoying Browser Hijacking»Analyst Predicts Dish, T-Mobile & Amazon Super UnionHere's How To Comment on the FCC Plan to Kill Net NeutralityWeekend Open Thread!FCC Falsely Claims Net Neutrality Took Away Your FreedomFriday Morning Links Google Fiber Confirms Louisville as New Launch CityDish, Hearst Strike New Deal, Channels to Return to Dish LineupComcast's Broadband Monopoly Helps it Buck Cord Cutting Threat----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 31 comments Nuggits join:2008-10-03 Happy Valley, OR·Comcast XFINITY Nuggits Member 2017-Apr-28 10:19 am I'm not a fan of mega-deals.

Airtel's Sunil Mittal Takes A Dig At Trump's US First Indiatimes April 29, 2017 As the US under President Donald Trump turns more protectionist, telecom czar Sunil Bharti Mittal asked if India should say no to Facebook and Google just because it has similar homegrown apps. BCCL Not overly concerned about protectionism as his business is "rooted in the domestic market", Mittal highlighted that it is unfair that movement of Indian workers gets restricted, while foreign firms make huge profits in India. "If you come to a situation where skilled workers which actually drive your economy back home are going to be denied (entry) or Indian companies are forced to pay a particular salary just to become un-competitive in those countries, I think that becomes an affirmative action against the companies that want to do trade there," he said. Citing examples of tech firms like Google, Facebook and WhatsApp that have millions of users in India, Mittal questioned if these companies should be allowed to operate in India even as similar homegrown apps are already there in the country.

Report: Apple Pay's Venmo-like feature could be integrated into iMessage Video Hands-on with Apple's new video-editing app, Clips There are already a zillion ways to send money to people: banks, Venmo, Square Cash, Google, and even social networks like Facebook and Snapchat have gotten in on the act. But Apple is reportedly looking to build a money transfer feature into Apple Pay so iPhone users can send money to each other. According to Recode, Apple has been in talks with payment processors and banks about a Venmo-like service for two years, but nothing has happened—yet. Those talks are back on, and we may see an Apple Pay money transfer feature as soon as this year. Apple would approach money transfers a little differently from existing services, Recode reported. In recent talks with Visa, Apple pitched the idea of a prepaid Visa debit card linked to Apple Pay’s wallet—so not physical cards, just digital ones—that would make transferred money immediately available to spend. When you transfer money to a friend with Venmo, for instance, it takes a few days for the cash to clear their bank account. Apple would solve that problem. Venmo Venmo lets you easily transfer money to pay for festival tickets, drinks, and even rent. But it’s unclear if Apple would incentivize Apple Pay users to sign up for yet another card when they already have debit cards with their banks. Recode says those banks are wary of Apple’s money transfer service precisely because of that debit card plan, which would put Apple’s card above existing cards in the Wallet app and position Apple in direct competition with its banking partners. But that’s not necessarily the case, particularly if Apple doesn’t offer any reason to switch cards. iPhone users trust Apple’s dedication to privacy and security and might be more likely to use Apple Pay to transfer money versus a service like Venmo or Square Cash. An Apple Pay money transfer feature would almost certainly boost adoption. While Apple Pay is quick and easy to use for in-store payments, people still aren’t using it very often, at least not in the U.S. They are, however, using Apple Pay to shop online. A money transfer feature would add another element to Apple Pay and increase users’ comfort level with the mobile payment service.

How Pittsburgh positioned itself as a tech and innovation power player. By John Marchese  |  April 29, 2017 at 9:00 pm comment on this post Photo via Dave DiCello/visit pittsburgh I came to Pittsburgh to see the future. On a blustery late-winter morning with a light whorl of snowflakes falling near the banks of the Allegheny River, Sarah, a friendly young PR person for Uber, opened the rear passenger door of a Volvo SUV that had so much electronic gear installed on the roof, it looked like it was wearing a crown. She gestured for me to take a seat. We were in the parking lot of Uber Advanced Technologies Group, a converted restaurant-equipment warehouse just north of downtown. I was about to have a very special Uber ride, and not just because it was free. I buckled up, and the Volvo headed out on a few blocks of 33rd Street that run under a hulking railroad trestle — an unsubtle symbol of the city’s heralded industrial past. The car turned toward downtown and headed into the bustling Strip District. We went a few miles and then circled back on Smallman Street to the Uber warehouse, which is situated in a part of Pittsburgh that recently has become such a magnet for tech research that one think-tank maven described it to me as “where you really feel you’re in the 21st century.” The ride took maybe 15 minutes and was uneventful except for a needless stop for a double-parked delivery truck outside one of the Strip’s many food stores and some hard braking when an impatient idiot passed us on the right. I can’t say much more about it because Uber wouldn’t let me in the door unless I signed an imposing confidentiality agreement, and Sarah reminded me several times, in her very friendly way, that the whole trip was “on background.” But I think I can reveal this: Though there was someone in the driver’s seat, for most of the trip the car drove itself. Two years ago, Uber announced it was starting a research facility to develop self-driving cars in Pittsburgh. Though the company said Pittsburgh was an ideal location because of its winding roads, hilly terrain and variable weather, the real draw was the opportunity to collaborate with Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute, where academic researchers affiliated with the country’s first PhD program in robotics had been working on autonomous vehicles for more than two decades. It wasn’t long before Uber, a company that takes pride in its sharp-elbow ethos, hired away about 40 of the top robotics people from CMU and decided to collaborate with itself. “Almost all the self-driving car technology anywhere — almost everyone in charge of it went to Carnegie Mellon,” says one of those poachees, Uber’s director of hardware engineering, Eric Meyhofer, whom I spoke with before my car ride. He’s a ’94 CMU grad who spent seven years working in Silicon Valley and then returned to his native Pittsburgh and took a special faculty position devoted to commercializing products developed by the Robotics Institute. The field is ready for its commercial moment. The CMU robotics program began with a grant from Westinghouse, and it’s always been unabashed about commercializing its inventions. In the past five years, the Robotics Institute has spun off 13 companies. “Robotics went from ‘Is it possible to make a robot walk?’” Meyhofer told me, “to ‘Is it possible to make a business out of walking robots?’” It seems certain now that we 21st-century humans will share our world with robots. If you interpret the definition loosely and just talk about the array of skills — artificial intelligence, machine learning, speech recognition and vision — we could see everything from bow-tied C-3PO types who mix drinks to roving mechanical security guards to driver-less cars to digital legal counsel. And somehow, as this brave new world begins to take shape, Pittsburgh is not only right in the middle of it all; it’s one of a few cities poised to lead it. Yes, Pittsburgh — the place out there past the Allegheny Mountains where they talk funny and that just three decades ago was the choking canary in the caving mine of America’s deindustrialization. “When the steel industry collapsed, 50,000 people a year were leaving the Pittsburgh region,” Tom Murphy remembers. The son of a steel-plant worker, Murphy became mayor of the city as it tried to patch together a recovery strategy in the 1990s. “In the city itself, we ended up losing 60 percent of our population,” he says. “And they weren’t going to the suburbs. They were going to Florida. “It forced us to rethink ourselves and who we were in a very different way. When I was growing up, 60 percent of the workers here worked in heavy industry. It’s 10 percent today. There had to be a physical transformation, because we had to do something with the old steel mills. There had to be a cultural transformation. You didn’t even need a high-school education to work in a steel mill. Now the universities had to step up and say, ‘We can be the economic engines of the region.’” The so-called “eds and meds” complex in Pittsburgh might be one of the most successful anywhere, and it’s particularly impressive for a city this size. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon, Duquesne and other, smaller schools add up to the sixth largest concentration of students in the country — over 80,000 of them in a city of about 300,000 people. Academic research funding almost matches what flows into Philadelphia, which is five times bigger. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which was one psychiatric hospital when the city started its downward spiral in 1979, has become a far-flung behemoth. The hard-charging institution that behaves a lot like an entrepreneurial company now has more than 25 hospitals, and it announced in March that it’s starting to move toward Philadelphia. UPMC employs about 56,000 people — more than any other private employer in Pennsylvania. With revenues topping $15 billion in 2016, the company now has executive offices that fill the top floors of the tallest tower in town, which used to be home to iconic local company U.S. Steel. Like other cities, Pittsburgh has lost some companies — like Lycos — that were hatched at its universities but have moved on. Lately, though, the city’s eds-and-meds sector is attracting what one economic report labeled “landing party” presences from the top players in tech. Google has 450 people working in a converted Nabisco cracker factory that’s helped anchor a redevelopment project changing the part of town called East Liberty. Amazon just moved into a former steel plant on the south side of town to research its voice-controlled products. Apple is in the city, as is Disney. Ford announced in February that it would buy a CMU spin-off company called Argo AI for more than a billion dollars — and spend another billion dollars over the next few years developing its own autonomous-car program in the city. Microsoft is teaming with Pitt, CMU and UPMC to bring Big Data innovations into health-care delivery. “We started to see this new economy being built on eds and meds,” says Pittsburgh’s current mayor, Bill Peduto, “[and] on top of that, we had a partnership of the foundations and the corporate community to build new buildings downtown. We were going through economic collapse, but the companies that stayed were growing. For instance, PNC became one of the top five banks in the country. We didn’t lose our sports teams. [Instead, the troubled city built two beautiful downtown stadiums on its rehabbed riverfronts, for the Steelers and Pirates.] And we didn’t sell off our cultural assets like the symphony or ballet. In fact, we doubled down on arts and amenities. “All those things came together in what I call the ‘Pittsburgh Model,’” Peduto tells me. With its collective back against the wall, the community pulled together and struggled to survive. “When we did come back,” the mayor brags, “we came back with everything we had when the city was wealthy.” • If you’ve come this far and are now concerned that you’ve somehow picked up the wrong city magazine, let’s go into the Pennsylvania Convention Center on a morning in October last year when 1,500 people assembled for the annual meeting of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. It was going to be the usual extravaganza of Babbittry and back-patting. Chamber CEO Rob Wonderling would praise pro-growth attitudes. Excelon’s Denis O’Brien would talk about the progress on diversity. But then John Fry came to the lectern. The amiable and energetic president of Drexel was that day assuming the role of chairman of the Chamber. He gave a short speech, and it contained references to his off-stated goal of inclusiveness in the city’s economic progress. But right off the top, Fry talked of crisis. “Not a crisis of survival, like the fiscal crisis of the early ’90s,” he explained. “Instead, this is a crisis of opportunity.” He cited analysis by the Brookings Institution that predicts a Darwinian world in which cities that thrive will have to be tech and innovation hubs, magnets for investment and talent. There would only be room for about two dozen of these cities around the globe, Fry explained. Philadelphia had all the assets in place except one: “a sense of urgency about competing for the first-tier position that is further complicated by complacency. … ” “There are other cities as close as Pittsburgh,” he told the Chamber crowd, “ … and they do have a sense of urgency. And they don’t suffer from complacency. And as we sit down to breakfast, they’re planning to eat our lunch.” Good line. But could it really be true? Pittsburgh? Eating our lunch? This isn’t a padded contact sport we’re talking about here, where being outscored on the ice or the gridiron by our more diminutive Commonwealth cousin is embarrassing but not life-threatening. “First off,” says Bruce Katz, the Brookings Institution Centennial Scholar whose research on the global economy of cities informed Fry’s Chamber of Commerce speech, “John Fry’s assessment of the competitive environment is completely on point.” Katz cites a recent report by the consulting company McKinsey that talked about 12 general-purpose technologies — like robotics, autonomous vehicles and genomics — that are moving from the lab, to testing, to prototyping, and ultimately to ubiquitous adoption. “The competition at this point is to become a first-mover city around one or several of those technologies,” he says. “Because whichever city gets in on the ground floor is going to get a whole bunch of jobs. There’ll be, let’s say, four cities in the United States with a potential to play at a big scale. “Both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh can and will compete in this sweepstakes,” Katz adds. “The thing about Pittsburgh is that it’s becoming a playground, a sandbox for innovation there.” Former Pittsburgh mayor Tom Murphy is now a fellow at the Urban Land Institute. Last year, he spoke in 47 cities. “I get invited to all these places,” Murphy told me, “because Pittsburgh is seen as a city that made it through. We had an intentionality about changing that many cities don’t have, because they’re comfortable.” Despite his speech, John Fry didn’t want to talk to me on the topic. So I started calling around. “In other places, like Pittsburgh,” Ajay Raju, chairman of Dilworth Paxson, told me, “new is embraced. Clever is encouraged. In our city, it’s often not the idea that matters as much as who is delivering the idea. A handful of toll keepers decides who gets to cross the bridge, and they have a jaundiced view when judging the new and the clever. And we are proud of that vetting process.” Yes, Philadelphia can be a very complacent place, he concluded: “It’s like a trust-fund city.” Real estate man Douglas Green, a transplant who now describes himself as “one of Philly’s biggest cheerleaders,” says his strongest sales pitch is that Philly is “an incredibly stable city.” But, Green admits, “Your best attribute can be your worst attribute. Without the stakes being high, it stifles innovation and creativity.” From Jefferson’s president Steve Klasko, who’s made disruption his personal brand: “What’s missing in Philadelphia is a real sense of urgency about competing for a first-tier position and [being willing] to do whatever it takes to get there.” Let’s leave some of the policy-wonk stuff aside. Pittsburgh is just plain buzzy right now. Since being named the best place in America to live in the mid-2000s by both the Economist Intelligence Unit and Places Rated Almanac, it has become a perennial overachiever in quality-of-life surveys. Zagat named it the nation’s top restaurant spot in 2015. Lately, publications like Vogue are urging weekend visits. It has an active movie production scene — The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises, Foxcatcher, The Fault in Our Stars — and the flashbacks for one of TV’s most talked-about shows, This Is Us, are set there. Add it all up — the robots, the rivers, the restaurants — and the hype about the Pittsburgh Renaissance is getting so loud that it’s almost comical. “I was talking to this guy in New York a couple weeks ago,” a Pittsburgh real estate developer told me, “a very sophisticated real estate guy. And he was saying, ‘Everybody wants to invest in Pittsburgh. In my mind, out there there’s like cars in the sky driving themselves.’ “And I said to him, ‘Have you ever been to Pittsburgh?’ “‘No,’ he said, ‘and I don’t want to go. I just want it to be like the Land of Oz in my mind. Whatever you’re doing out there, you’re doing it right.’” • What’s the secret? The Pennsylvania Turnpike isn’t exactly the Yellow Brick Road, but one stormy late-winter morning, I got into my driver-required car and headed to Oz. I booked a hotel room in East Liberty, once a kind of second downtown with a large African-American population. The neighborhood was decimated by ill-advised urban renewal efforts in the ’50s and ’60s but is undergoing a rebirth and gentrification — or, perhaps more accurately, technification. I checked into the hipster haven Ace Hotel Pittsburgh, which is just a few blocks from the converted Nabisco factory that now houses Google as well as a health technology research center, run by UPMC, designed to spin off new companies. The Ace occupies a rehabbed YMCA building that had been unused for 24 years. “When we were starting the hotel project,” one of the Ace’s developers, Matthew Ciccone, told me, “I read an article in the Wall Street Journal that was basically Portland saying, ‘Dear hipsters, stop moving here. We have no jobs for you. Stop coming.’ And I remember trying to figure out what Portland had done to become that kind of place.” Now, Pittsburgh has a distinct Portland-like attraction, except there are jobs. According to recent census data, lately there’s been an in-migration to Pittsburgh from Philadelphia. “Projects like this hotel,” said Ciccone, who’s been developing co-working spaces, “repositioned the city and made it attractive to companies like Google and Amazon and Uber.” And maybe millennials from Northeast Philly. One morning, I drove to a rather forlorn zone of warehouses and auto-supply companies and walked into a former wood-working warehouse with a fresh coat of paint. Inside, I met a recent migrant from Philly, Dick Zhang, a friendly 23-year-old with a quick barking laugh. He grew up near Princeton, studied engineering at Penn, and did some extra coursework at Wharton. Three years ago, he drove himself to Pittsburgh, setting out at 3 a.m. to make a 9 a.m. meeting to pitch his business concept to an incubator called AlphaLab Gear. His idea was for drones that would fly above large construction sites and sweep the terrain with 3-D sensors. He was developing software to analyze the resulting data to tell the construction companies exactly how much earth they would need to move, how long it would take and how much it would cost. AlphaLab accepted him, and the result is a company called Identified Technologies that now has 25 employees and $3 million in funding from a Pittsburgh-based venture capital firm. Revenues last year grew 900 percent. Pittsburgh wasn’t Zhang’s first choice; he initially went through every business-plan competition he could enter around Penn. But his hardware technology company couldn’t get traction in Philadelphia, and Zhang perceived a decided bias toward medical companies. “Structurally,” he told me, “there was more support for our technology company in Pittsburgh.” And what about living there? “It’s been a little bit of a culture shock,” Zhang said. “But living here — I think the right word is ‘delightful.’ We’ve recruited people from the San Francisco Bay area, from Texas cities, from Boston and New York, and it’s noticeable to them, the livability of this city.” In the year or so that he’s been growing the company and finding new customers — including one of the contractors building a multibillion-dollar ethane cracker plant 30 miles outside of Pittsburgh that highlights the region’s Marcellus Shale assets and opportunities in energy technology — Zhang noticed something else. “In my world,” he said, “it’s all about customer discovery — who are you going to help? And our mayor here in Pittsburgh is big on understanding the concerns of the customer. One thing I will give Mayor Peduto credit for is that we’ve had multiple conversations where the context is: ‘What can the city of Pittsburgh be doing to support you?’ You’d be surprised how many governments don’t have that mentality.” Bill Peduto is running for reelection to his second term as Pittsburgh’s mayor. He’s a stocky 52-year-old bachelor with a degree in political science from Penn State. He’s been known to guest-DJ at local college radio stations, and in his 12 years on Pittsburgh’s city council, he regularly hosted a night where he spun records and played music videos at a bar. Though his self-assessment is “I’m so not hip that somehow that turns into being hip,” people who know him say he gets tech and understands the importance of innovation. Peduto has lately been critical of Uber’s corporate policies (and the company briefly suspended its self-driving program after an Arizona crash), but the mayor opened the door wide when Uber first came knocking. The New York Times later quoted his rationale: “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” Peduto says that attitude isn’t new: “It’s been in our DNA in Pittsburgh to collaborate since the 1940s.” It only takes a shallow dive into Pittsburgh’s civic history to come across tales of the Allegheny Conference, which had its beginnings when rich Republican banker Richard King Mellon and the city’s mayor, the working-class Democratic-machine pol David Lawrence, got together to solve the city’s awful air and water pollution and downtown land-use problems. The conference is credited with pulling in disparate players — business, government, philanthropy — and fostering an unusual level of collaboration. It became a sort of super Chamber of Commerce that actually got things done — often, big things. By the time the latest crisis arrived, most of the originators of the Allegheny Conference were gone, and the organization had become an institution subject to the laws of inertia. It certainly contributed during Pittsburgh’s existential crisis in the ’80s and ’90s, fostering region-wide cooperation and spinning off the Cultural Trust, which built a downtown arts district. But collaboration now would be more ad hoc. In a relatively small city, the top players simply knew one another better, and it was easier to get important people into the same room. Plus, there wasn’t much choice; the stakes were too high. “Don’t get me wrong. It’s hard to get people to change. And sometimes it was hand-to-hand combat,” says Tom Murphy, the mayor from 1994 to 2006. But, Murphy insists, “The key piece of our revival is, we formed a very, very close partnership between the business community and the universities and the political leadership. I was meeting every other week with the leadership of the business organizations and the universities.” Whether such cooperation is DNA-deep in the city is debatable, but informed observers notice something different about Pittsburgh. David Thornburgh, born there, son of a governor, longtime government professor and now head of Philadelphia’s good-government watchdog Committee of Seventy, concludes: “Pittsburgh’s business and civic community has had a critical mass and a focus and a discipline that has been harder to come by in Philadelphia.” Max King studied Philadelphia closely during his 27 years at the Inquirer, including nearly a decade as editor in chief. He moved to Pittsburgh in 1999 and is now CEO of the Pittsburgh Foundation. “If you look at Pittsburgh’s history,” King told me, “it’s a place that tends to be entrepreneurial, risk-taking and creative. A place that likes to go for the big bet.” Among its surprising assets, Pittsburgh is home to a bevy of well-endowed foundations — Mellon, Hillman, Benedum, Heinz — all of which focus their philanthropy on their hometown. “The money stays here,” King says. And, he adds, “Different from other places I’ve lived — New York, Boston, Philadelphia — Pittsburgh acts and feels like a community. That makes a big difference.” The big bet now is on cars that drive themselves and robots that walk and how much they’ll change the world as we know it — and what being in the center of the action will do for Pittsburgh. Eric Meyhofer, sitting in the sleek and futuristic Uber outpost in the converted warehouse on the banks of the Allegheny River, confidently made the connection between his company and his community: “Pittsburgh has always been scrappy and has always been fighting and slowly winning. It’s gotten to a point of vitality, and now there’s going to be a hockey-stick uptick because of tech here. “With changing the world comes the need to be scrappy,” Meyhofer added. “And I think the sense of urgency is very pronounced in Uber’s culture … and matches Pittsburgh in a lot of ways. It’s a good fit.” So, I finally ask the city’s mayor, are you folks out there — are yinz — preparing to eat Philadelphia’s lunch? “After 50 years of being off the global stage,” says Peduto, who still skates in an ice hockey league, “Pittsburgh is ready for its reentry. We want to compete, not as a post-industrial city, but as a 21st-century city. And just like a great Pens-vs.-Flyers game, we always look for great competition with our neighbors to the east.” I’ve been trying to avoid sports analogies even more than mentioning cheesesteaks vs. french fry sandwiches. But now that I’ve been to Pittsburgh and back, and per Peduto, it seems to me that while Philly lays claim to Rocky Balboa, Pittsburgh is that character’s civic analog — down on its luck, battered against the ropes, but now back in contention and, by all appearances, ready to punch above its weight.

Campbell Simpson May 1, 2017, 10:30am ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories feature galaxy s8 samsung video feature Share The Samsung Galaxy S8 is Samsung's first big phone launch after last year's Note7 disaster. It's a huge moment for the world's most popular smartphone manufacturer. For a lot of everyday smartphone buyers - the talkback radio listeners and tabloid newspaper readers of the world - Samsung is a tarnished name. The Galaxy S8 is the first, and potentially only, chance for the company to change that opinion. Here's how it fared during our in-depth testing. What Is It? The $1199 Samsung Galaxy S8 and $1349 Galaxy S8+ (or Plus, if you prefer) are the new kids in town, and they mean business. The smaller of the two, the 149x68x8mm S8 packs a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display into its skinny body — itself barely taller than last year's S7, which only had a 5.1-inch screen. The 159x73x8.1mm S8+ has a huge 6.2-inch screen. Both achieve this with what Samsung calls its 'Infinity Display', with a significantly longer 18.5:9 ratio that's noticeably taller than the 16:9 widescreen displays we're already used to. When you first hold the Galaxy S8 or the slightly elongated Galaxy S8+ in your hand, it's familiar — especially to anyone that's used a Galaxy S6 edge or S6 edge plus from 2015 or last year's S7 edge — but at the same time you quickly realise that something is different. So much of the front of the Galaxy S8 is screen. Charging comes from USB Type-C down the bottom, there's still a headphone jack, and up top you'll see a unified SIM tray that holds a nanoSIM plus a slot for microSD expandable storage of up to 2TB — although, at the moment, only 256GB cards are available. The phone itself has 64GB of onboard storage, which should be plenty for most users, but having the option for removable storage is definitely preferable to not. The first phones to use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 10-nanometre processor internationally and Samsung's own Exynos 8895 10nm octa-core in Australia, the S8 is fast. Supremely fast. More CPU and GPU power than ever before makes for a phone that doesn't slow down during the complex tasks I tried out on it. Moreover, it'll support 1Gbps download speeds on Telstra's 4G network in Australia — in select CBD areas, at least. What's It Good At? The Galaxy S8 is an absolutely gorgeous piece of hardware. I genuinely think it's the most beautiful phone — the symphony of screen, cameras, and other user-facing gadgets and the metal and glass and paint that shroud and surround them — that has ever been built. In the week that I've been using it full time, I've had more than a few wow moments, from friends and family and even from a person that walked past when I was in a cafe. It's all screen on the front, apart from the tiniest top and bottom bezels that hide away the front-facing camera and iris scanner and other tech. There are side buttons for power and volume and Bixby. The rear of the phone is no more ostentatious than necessary, with a small camera bump and Samsung logo and little else. That design is practical, too. A more refined curve of edge glass means that your fingers and palm won't register errant presses any more — it was a small issue on the Galaxy S7 edge. The rear glass means fast wireless charging is possible. There's no non-curved version of the Galaxy S8 this time around, but I don't particularly miss the flat display of the smaller 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 when it means having the ultra-tall, nearly bezel-less Infinity Display of the S8. In a phone that's less wide than the previous iteration and barely a centimetre taller (for both the S7 versus S8 and the S7 edge versus S8+), it packs a screen .7 inches larger in diagonal size. That's a huge difference, and frankly it makes any phone without its tall edge-to-edge display look a bit old and outdated. The screen takes up a full 83 per cent of the front of the Galaxy S8, which is far and away the largest screen-to-body ratio of any phone that you can buy today. Put it next to an iPhone 7 Plus — a phone with the same height dimensions, as well as being wider and thicker — and the difference is night and day. We're talking a 6.2-inch screen versus a 5.5-inch one, and bezels versus... no bezels. It's stunning. It does present some minor usability issues, but they're ones that you quickly learn to live with. Everything that's not screen is hidden off to the side — or around the back, like the fingerprint sensor. This is a phone built for viewing and for touching. It's gratifying; it feels the closest of any phone to any of those thin-slice-of-glass sci-fi datapads we've seen in movies for years now. The Infinity Display is better for watching widescreen video. It just is. You get the same screen size as a 5.5-inch 16:9 phone on the 6.2-inch 18.5:9 S8+ when you're watching the same 16:9 content, and if you want it to take up the entire screen you can just zoom. On cinematic content shot in 2.35:1 or 2.39:1 — we're talking your blockbuster movies like Star Wars: Rogue One — you can crop out any black bars that appear on a widescreen phone and have the entire display filled with video. And wow. It looks good. It is, by all accounts, an absolutely amazing display, either for a smartphone or for any display hands down. While the rear camera stays the same as last year, which is a disappointment — more on that later — the autofocusing 8-megapixel front-facing camera is a significant upgrade from previous models. Having autofocus makes a big difference for the consistent sharpness of your selfies; where a fixed-focus camera had to be designed for a best guess — usually at the distance of an outstretched arm, I guess? — the front-facing camera now accurately snaps clear and detailed photos. As a general rule, I've hated front-facing cameras before this one, but I'm actually using it on the S8. As someone that doesn't really normally take selfies, this is a quantum leap for me. It's not a bad camera, and that's the biggest compliment I could give any forward-facing sensor. Samsung continues to refine the software on every new flagship Galaxy phone, and that's true more than ever on the Galaxy S8. Taking heavy cues from the Grace UX of the ill-fated Note7, the S8's interface built on top of Android 7.0 is clean and — mostly — free of unnecessary fripperies. The launcher in particular, with its straightforward approach to app icons and folders and widgets, is finally a legitimate competitor to Google's own Pixel launcher. The move to on-screen buttons could have been jarring, but Samsung's use of a pressure-sensitive panel for the home button means that navigating the S8's interface feels normal and natural. It's not quite as awesome as 3D Touch on the iPhone 7, but it's getting there. As for other software tweaks, the active notification bubble that pops up while you're using the phone, and the extremely customisable always-on display — both are things I'll miss on iOS or other Android devices. And yes, you have a wired headphone jack on the Galaxy S8 — and some surprisingly good AKG in-ear headphones thrown in the box as a nice extra. Charging is done over the same USB Type-C connector that the Galaxy Note7 introduced to the world, and it's fast — an 18-Watt fast charger and USB to Type-C cable are included in the box, as are adapters to bring content from your old phone and to use an existing microUSB cable with the S8's Type-C connector. You get 64GB of onboard storage — great! — and a microSD slot that can take another card up to 2TB — even better! and a surprisingly loud mono speaker in the base of the phone. It's as complete a hardware package as any 2017 flagship smartphone competitor out ther. What's It Not Good At? Samsung's choice to move the S8's fingerprint reader to the rear of the phone has an entirely rational reason behind it: there just isn't space for it on the front any more. But in moving it to the rear and to the left side of the camera and flash module, Samsung has made it more difficult to use than central readers like those on the LG G6 and Google Pixel. It's harder to reach with the forefinger of your right hand, which is the finger most people — I've asked around — use to unlock their rear-sensing phones. As a result, I use it a lot less than I did when it was on the front — it's not a huge deal since there are other biometrics in use like the iris scanner, but it's a frustrating stumble on an otherwise excellent design. When it works, iris scanning is very effective. But to make it work, your face and eyes must be in a very specific orientation, around 25 to 35 centimetres from the S8's display. Occasionally I've caught myself staring at the top of my locked phone like a crazy person. As for the face scanning, I don't think it's unreasonable to say that I have a pretty generic face — I shave my head and I have a modest beard — but I couldn't make the S8's face recognition work reliably for me. Apparently you can fool it with a printed photo, but I couldn't do that either. All in all, the S8 has a swathe of biometrics at its disposal but none of them is as straightforward an implementation as the old-school clicky front button. The Samsung Galaxy S8 takes some great photos. It has an excellent sensor and very competent image processing that draws out excellent colour with smooth gradients and generally good exposures — maybe a little overexposed by default, but that's really no surprise for a smartphone. But my complaint, again minor as it is, is that it's not a huge upgrade from last year's (yes, excellent) Galaxy S7. I was a little bit mystified to see the same sensor used in the Galaxy Note7, but to see it used again in the S8 is mystifying further. As with the LG G6, you're buying into a bit of hardware in the Galaxy S8 that software hasn't quite caught up with. That 18.5:9 aspect ratio display is — in most of the apps that you'll use on it — a little bit wasted, with many video services and games stuck at that 16:9 widescreen ratio we've been using on phones for years. You can scale or crop some apps like YouTube, but it's an imperfect solution to the problem. When apps are built for the display itself or able to dynamically adjust, like Samsung's camera app or Google Photos or It's a bit like the difficult birth of USB-C — it'll get there in time, but things won't be absolutely perfect along the way. At launch, Bixby is a little bit half-cooked. There's no 'Hello Bixby' voice control in Australia at launch, while the service gets localised for Aussie accents and software partners. If you short-press the S8's Bixby button you'll get a Google Now-style home screen with cards for your calendar, Facebook trending topics, S Health data and so on. It's good, but it's also redundant because Google Now already exists — why re-invent the wheel, Samsung? Bixby Vision, the augmented reality component, can pick out landmarks like the Opera House, but struggles with everyday items; powered by Pinterest, it makes some interesting guesses at cups of coffee and department store purchases. It's a boon that Google Assistant works out of the box on the S8 — and that's a very good thing. Just like on the Pixel and the G6, it works very well, and it's still the best voice assistant you can use on Android. Battery life? Well, it's mediocre. It's OK. It's more than enough for a full day of work, with a reasonably bright screen and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth switched on and all the usual trimmings. It meets the standards that I expect any half-decent Android phone to meet in 2017. But, courtesy of that massive screen in a small body, the 3000mAh and 3500mAh cells in the S8 and S8+ respectively won't give you the two-day battery life of a phone with a larger battery and less bright screen like the Huawei Mate 9. It charges quickly over USB Type-C and also has wireless charging, so filling it back up is easy — you'll just have to do it on a regular basis. And one small, final caveat: in the same way that massive phones aren't for some people, tall phones aren't going to be for some people either. Even with my reasonably large hands it can be hard to reach up to swipe down the notification menu when holding the S8+ one-handed. If you've got smaller hands, you might struggle even with the smaller S8. These phones have massive screens stuffed into slim, svelte bodies, but they're long screens and that requires you hold the phone a certain way to make everything accessible; you can't rest the bottom of the S8 against your pinkie finger and still reach the top. Should You Buy It? Yes. The Galaxy S8 and plus-sized S8+ are absolutely brilliant smartphones. They're not without their flaws, but in everything from industrial design to internal hardware to software refinement, Samsung has knocked this one out of the park.

Campbell Simpson 01 May 2017 10:30 AM The Samsung Galaxy S8 is Samsung's first big phone launch after last year's Note7 disaster. It's a huge moment for the world's most popular smartphone manufacturer. For a lot of everyday smartphone buyers - the talkback radio listeners and tabloid newspaper readers of the world - Samsung is a tarnished name. The Galaxy S8 is the first, and potentially only, chance for the company to change that opinion. Here's how it fared during our in-depth testing. Why The Police's Metadata Screw Up Changes Everything Anthony Caruana 01 May 2017 12:30 PM Late last week, the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police revealed that an officer has accessed the personal metadata of an Australian journalist as part of an investigation into that reporter’s sources for a story about the AFP. While Commissioner Colvin put it down to "human error” there is far more to this. What we have seen in this specific case is a complete breakdown of the protections we deserve as private citizens.

Google, Facebook and Twitter were accused of shameful and indefensible behaviour in failing to take down vicious material even after it had been reported to them. The Commons home affairs committee said websites that spread terrorist propaganda, far-Right racial abuse and murderous threats were probably already committing offences punishable by jail. MPs have said social media firms that refuse to remove extremist or abusive content should face criminal charges They urged ministers to move after the election to strengthen legislation to ensure criminal laws are used. Sanctions should include heavy fines for companies that fail to take down hate material within a short time, the MPs said. In a scathing report, the committee called for a string of regulations to ensure internet giants take their reponsibilities seriously. The MPs accused them of putting profit before public safety. They said Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, were ‘outsourcing their responsibilities at zero expense’ by demanding users report material before they will take it down.

Share this article Share The companies should be made to pay the cost of policing their sites for vicious material in the same way that football clubs pay police to maintain order on matchdays, the committee argued. They called it ‘completely unacceptable’ that multinationals decline to say how many people they have working to remove extremist or hateful material. The companies should have to produce transparent reports every three months that say exactly what they are doing to police themselves, and they should give the number and seniority of the people doing the work, the MPs said. The report added: ‘Quick action is taken to remove content found to infringe copyright rules, but that same prompt action is not taken when the material involves hateful or illegal content.’ Yvette Cooper said failure to deal with illegal material online is a 'disgrace' Yvette Cooper, the Labour chairman of the committee, said: ‘Social media companies’ failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace. ‘They have been asked repeatedly to come up with better systems to remove illegal material such as terrorist recruitment or online child abuse. Yet repeatedly they have failed to do so. It is shameful. These are among the biggest, richest and cleverest companies in the world, and their services have become a crucial part of people’s lives. This isn’t beyond them to solve, yet they are failing to do so. ‘They continue to operate as platforms for hatred and extremism without even taking basic steps to make sure they can quickly stop illegal material, properly enforce their own community standards, or keep people safe.’ A spokesman for YouTube said it took the issue very seriously and was taking action. Simon Milner of Facebook said it had developed quick and easy ways for people to report content. Nick Pickles of Twitter said it had significantly expanded its efforts to deal with offensive material.

A hard-hitting report accused major firms of putting more effort into protecting their profits than keeping the public safe online. Ministers should consider forcing firms to pay for the cost of policing on social media and introducing a system of sanctions with multimillion-pound fines, the Home Affairs Select Committee said.

But they said "nowhere near enough is being done". The committee said it had found "repeated examples of social media companies failing to remove illegal content when asked to do so", including "dangerous" terrorist recruitment material, promotion of sexual abuse of children and incitement to racial hatred. The report said: "The biggest companies have been repeatedly urged by Governments, police forces, community leaders and the public to clean up their act, and to respond quickly and proactively to identify and remove illegal content. They have repeatedly failed to do so. Read more Ebay founder pledges $100m to fight ‘fake news’ and hate speech "That should not be accepted any longer. Social media is too important to everyone - to communities, individuals, the economy and public life - to continue with such a lax approach to dangerous content that can wreck lives. "And the major social media companies are big enough, rich enough and clever enough to sort this problem out - as they have proved they can do in relation to advertising or copyright. "It is shameful that they have failed to use the same ingenuity to protect public safety and abide by the law as they have to protect their own income." In their strongly worded report, the MPs accused Google, which owns YouTube, of making money from hatred because adverts appear alongside "inappropriate and unacceptable content, some of which were created by terrorist organisations" - with the creators of the extreme content also getting a share of the revenue. Although some advertisers had withdrawn their business from the site and Google may suffer financially as a result, "the most salient fact is that one of the world's largest companies has profited from hatred and has allowed itself to be a platform from which extremists have generated revenue". The MPs said it was "unacceptable" that social media companies relied on users to report content, claiming the firms were "outsourcing" the role "at zero expense" while expecting the police - funded by the taxpayer - to bear the costs of keeping their platforms and reputations "clean of extremism". They suggested a similar model to that used in football, where clubs are obliged to pay for policing around their stadiums on match days, urging ministers to consult on requiring social media firms to contribute to the cost of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism internet referral unit (CTIRU). They also suggested considering "meaningful fines" for social media companies which fail to remove illegal content within a strict timeframe, highlighting proposals in Germany which could see firms fined up to £44 million and individual executives £5 million. The committee's Labour chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: "Social media companies' failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace. "They have been asked repeatedly to come up with better systems to remove illegal material such as terrorist recruitment or online child abuse. Yet repeatedly, they have failed to do so. It is shameful."

The largest and richest technology firms are “shamefully far” from taking action to tackle illegal and dangerous content, according to a report by the Commons home affairs committee. The inquiry, launched last year following the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right gunman, concludes that social media multinationals are more concerned with commercial risks than public protection. Swift action is taken to remove content found to infringe copyright rules, the MPs note, but a “laissez-faire” approach is adopted when it involves hateful or illegal content. Referring to Google’s failure to prevent paid advertising from reputable companies appearing next to YouTube videos posted by extremists, the committee’s report said: “One of the world’s largest companies has profited from hatred and has allowed itself to be a platform from which extremists have generated revenue.” In Germany, the report points out, the justice ministry has proposed imposing financial penalties of up to €50m on social media companies that are slow to remove illegal content. “Social media companies currently face almost no penalties for failing to remove illegal content,” the MPs conclude. “We recommend that the government consult on a system of escalating sanctions, to include meaningful fines for social media companies which fail to remove illegal content within a strict timeframe.” Google runs workshops to help UK teenagers tackle hate speech Read more During its investigation, the committee found instances of terror recruitment videos for banned jihadi and neo-Nazi groups remaining accessible online even after MPs had complained about them. Some of the material included antisemitic, hate-crime attacks on MPs that had been the subject of a previous committee report. Material encouraging child abuse and sexual images of children was also not removed, despite being reported on by journalists. Social media companies that fail to proactively search for and remove illegal content should pay towards costs of the police doing so, the report recommends, just as football clubs are obliged to pay for policing in their stadiums and surrounding areas on match days. The government, the report says, should consider whether failure to remove illegal material is in itself a crime and, if not, how the law should be strengthened. The thrust of the committee’s arguments suggest social media companies need to be treated as though they are traditional publishers. Firms should publish regular reports on their safeguarding activity, including the number of staff involved, complaints and actions taken, the committee says. It is “completely irresponsible” that social media companies are failing to tackle illegal and dangerous content and to implement even their own community standards, the report adds. A thorough review is required of the legal framework controlling online hate speech, abuse and extremism to ensure that the law is up to date, the MPs conclude. “What is illegal offline should be illegal – and enforced – online.” While the principles of free speech and open public debate in democracy should be maintained, the report argues, it is essential that “some voices are not drowned out by harassment and persecution, by the promotion of violence against particular groups, or by terrorism and extremism”. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the home affairs committee, said: “Social media companies’ failure to deal with illegal and dangerous material online is a disgrace. “They have been asked repeatedly to come up with better systems to remove illegal material such as terrorist recruitment or online child abuse. Yet repeatedly they have failed to do so. It is shameful. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Man accused of posting murder footage on Facebook kills himself “These are among the biggest, richest and cleverest companies in the world, and their services have become a crucial part of people’s lives. This isn’t beyond them to solve, yet they are failing to do so. They continue to operate as platforms for hatred and extremism without even taking basic steps to make sure they can quickly stop illegal material, properly enforce their own community standards, or keep people safe … “It is blindingly obvious that they have a responsibility to proactively search their platforms for illegal content, particularly when it comes to terrorist organisations.” Google, the parent company of YouTube, told the inquiry that it has plans to extend its “trusted flagger” programme to identify terrorist propaganda and would invest in improving its alert procedures. It said that it “no interest” in making money from extremist material. Facebook also told MPs that it is is reviewing how it handles violent videos and other objectionable material after a video of a murder in the United States remained on its service for more than two hours. Google, Facebook and Twitter all refused to tell the committee how many staff they employ to monitor and remove inappropriate content.

Australian arrested in Colombia with cocaine Cassandra Sainsbury could face up to 25 years in prison after being caught allegedly carrying 5.8kg of cocaine in her luggage. More videos A record year for the world's richest Gina Rinehart was one of many billionaires who saw their fortunes increase dramatically in the last 12 months according to Forbes magazine. That marks his third straight year getting nine-figure pay - a rare accomplishment even at well-paying technology companies and virtually unheard of in other industries. Since he became CEO in 2015, Pichai has moved to give Google more control over two critical fields: artificial intelligence and cloud. Related Content Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results Is a CEO worth $260m? Shareholders at this company think so He oversaw a 17.8 per cent jump in Google's core ads business last year, while also boosting its revenue in cloud and hardware, a long-sought goal of the company. Pichai's 2016 compensation consisted mainly of 273,328 Class C shares that vest quarterly through 2019 if he remains on the job. Advertisement The award was granted about six months after the tech business announced it would reorganise into holding company Alphabet. As part of the transition, Pichai was tapped to lead Google, taking the reins from Larry Page who became chief executive of the parent entity. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link It is the third-straight year Sundar Pichai has received a nine-figure salary. Photo: Michael Short It wasn't the first time that following in Page's footsteps led to big payouts for Pichai. In 2015, he got about $US100 million in reported compensation after he was promoted to senior vice-president of products and took over many of Page's responsibilities overseeing areas such as search and ad products. That made him one of the highest-paid US executives that year, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. His biggest pay package that can be gleaned from filings came in 2014. He got 442,424 shares worth about $US250 million in August that year, shortly before his promotion. The stock will be fully vested in 2018. Since Alphabet wasn't required to disclose his compensation at the time, filings don't reveal why he received such a large grant. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the award. Alphabet also didn't disclose any salary or cash bonus paid to Pichai in 2014. The California-based company typically grants equity awards to top bosses once every two years, a strategy it has said "encourages executives to take a long-term view of the business". Chief financial officer Ruth Porat got a $US39.1 million pay package for 2016, most of it in a stock award that vests through 2019. Bloomberg 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

According to a report by cbronline.com, the AI system, which was trained using almost 5,000 hours of TV footage from the BBC, contained a total of 118,000 sentences from the videos. The key contributions include a “Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell” (WLAS), a network that learns to transcribe videos of mouth motion to characters. In an article published by arix.org, the goal of the work was to recognize phrases and sentences uttered by a talking face, with or without the audio. DeepMind stated that unlike previous works that have focused on recognizing a limited number of words or phrases, they tackle lip reading as an open-world problem – unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos. The same media report added that the AI was trained on shows which aired during the period between January 2010 and December 2015, and later tested its performance on programs between March and September of this year. The lip reader was only able to decipher less than one-quarter of the spoken words, whilst the WLAS model was able to decipher half of the spoken words. Based on the report, citing the News Scientist, Ziheng Zhou at the University of Oulu, Finland, said that it was a big step for developing fully automatic lip-reading systems. “Without the huge dataset, it’s very difficult for us to verify new technologies like deep learning,” he added. In its summary, the architecture of the WLAS model surpassed the performance of all previous work on standard lip reading benchmark datasets, and demonstrated that visual information helps to improve speech recognition performance even when audio is used.  Facebook Comments Website Comments mike tyson March 6th, 2017 Reply z1SL9Y Really appreciate you sharing this article.Thanks Again. rasen schneiden March 6th, 2017 Reply A big thank you for your blog article.Really looking forward to read more.

Amazon profits climbed more than 40 percent, to $724 million. It was its eighth quarter in a row of profit. Microsoft also had a strong quarter, with profits up nearly 28 percent, while chipmaker Intel’s profits rose 45 percent. Amazon said its growth was propelled by sales for web services and retail subscriptions, such as Amazon Prime. The firm highlighted its international activity, noting expansion in India, Mexico and the UK. But executives told investors that more spending on content, products and warehouses for distribution lies ahead. “Although Amazon’s sales advanced by a respectable 23 percent over the quarter, the pace of growth at the online behemoth remains much slower than it was over most of the prior fiscal year,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “Some of this is the result of a less favourable exchange rate diluting contributions from the international business. However, some is also down to a more challenging demand environment in North America, which has limited spending uplifts on products within Amazon’s core territory.” Microsoft was lifted by its cloud computing products, such as Azure, which were $4.8 billion, up 28 percent compared with the previous year. “Our results this quarter reflect the trust customers are placing in the Microsoft Cloud,” said Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella. “From large multinationals to small and medium businesses to non-profits all over the world, organisations are using Microsoft’s cloud platforms to power their digital transformation.” Microsoft also received a boost from social network LinkedIn, which it bought for $26 billion in June last year. It contributed $975 million in revenue in the quarter, $25 million more than analysts had predicted. Chipmaker Intel’s profits rose 45 percent to $2.9 billion, with revenue up 8 percent.

That marks his third straight year getting nine-figure pay - a rare accomplishment even at well-paying technology companies and virtually unheard of in other industries. Since he became CEO in 2015, Pichai has moved to give Google more control over two critical fields: artificial intelligence and cloud.

Shareholders at this company think so He oversaw a 17.8 per cent jump in Google's core ads business last year, while also boosting its revenue in cloud and hardware, a long-sought goal of the company. Pichai's 2016 compensation consisted mainly of 273,328 Class C shares that vest quarterly through 2019 if he remains on the job.

As part of the transition, Pichai was tapped to lead Google, taking the reins from Larry Page who became chief executive of the parent entity. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link It is the third-straight year Sundar Pichai has received a nine-figure salary. Photo: Michael Short It wasn't the first time that following in Page's footsteps led to big payouts for Pichai. In 2015, he got about $US100 million in reported compensation after he was promoted to senior vice-president of products and took over many of Page's responsibilities overseeing areas such as search and ad products. That made him one of the highest-paid US executives that year, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. His biggest pay package that can be gleaned from filings came in 2014. He got 442,424 shares worth about $US250 million in August that year, shortly before his promotion. The stock will be fully vested in 2018. Since Alphabet wasn't required to disclose his compensation at the time, filings don't reveal why he received such a large grant. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the award. Alphabet also didn't disclose any salary or cash bonus paid to Pichai in 2014. The California-based company typically grants equity awards to top bosses once every two years, a strategy it has said "encourages executives to take a long-term view of the business". Chief financial officer Ruth Porat got a $US39.1 million pay package for 2016, most of it in a stock award that vests through 2019. Bloomberg 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Chromecast HDMI CEC support is broken for some users, Google working on a fix Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/19 2:14pm PDTApr 19, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Chromecast Google News Back in 2015, Google updated the Chromecast to support HDMI CEC, which allows users to control their devices connected via HDMI with just one remote. Instead of pulling out your phone or tablet for every minor action, some controls (like playing/pausing) can be done through your TV's remote. Unfortunately, a recent Chromecast firmware update broke the feature, but Google is working to fix it. The feature originally stopped working after the 1.23 firmware update was released. Google later released version 1.23.84839 to fix the problem, but a few users are still reporting that CEC is broken. If you have a Chromecast and CEC isn't working, you can leave a comment at the source link below. Google is looking through reports to create a proper fix, so all feedback is appreciated.

It's the blessing / curse of cloud computing. You WILL use the current version, whether it's any good or not. George Byers Numerous Windows 10 updates have accidentally bricked millions of machines. Nothing's perfect. Celilo Not even close to the same thing. An almost unlimited combination of hardware is supported by windows. Google has a an extremely limited number of devices to support and should be able to easily test the limited functionality of a chromecast. This is simply poor quality control. TedPhillips something like cec is also largely dependent on what it's plugged into, so i'd say that expands the possibilities quite a bit. abqnm Is this just beta users? I'm not in the beta (or whatever it's called) and I'm still on 1.22.77272 and have working HDMI-CEC support, though it does stop working from time to time and I have to use my phone, but that's not new. Dan huh, didn't even know it had that functionality. Have to try it out now. MikeJwF My exact reaction. Nicoleckeys Google is paying 97$ per hour!

YaKillaCJ Been had it. It's basically a way to turn on your TV automatically. Not much else you can really do. George Byers I can actually use the play/pause button on my Sony tv remote to control the chromecast. Dosen't work on my Panasonic or Samsung though. YaKillaCJ Oh yea I forgot that does work. It just doesn't let you control rewind & forward. Least not last I checked in YouTube. Which sucks. U can however navigate prev & next in Google Play Music. But that boils down to the limitations of Chromecast and the lack of an UI. On AndroidTV CEC works great. Tested on my Xiaomi MiBox and Google Nexus Player Dan I did try this last night, and it does work with my Panasonic TV remote to play/pause. 2009 vintage 46" plasma. Scott Breitbach I knew about the "turn on your TV" feature, but didn't realize I might be able to Play/Pause. That would be super useful for the ~50% of the time when my phone loses chromecast connection and I have to spend precious few seconds I have at the end of a show trying to reconnect before it starts automatically playing the next episode. : quick Switching to the correct video input as well on your TV or AVR, that's a big deal. atc-tech My quit working the opposite way. When I clicked on my phone/tablet/chrome to cast something, it would automatically turn on the TV and switch the input to HDMI 3 (chromecast). Now, it does nothing and I do those steps manually. I am not a Beta tester or anything as someone suggested below. Tom Westrick How the hell does a hardware feature break? YaKillaCJ Nearly all devices excluding mechanical have some form of software (usually the kernel) to control said hardware. Including anything running a Graphical User Interface.

I usually use my tablet when interfacing with my Chromecast. I wasn't aware of a remote control option. Peter HDMI CEC stopped working on my Gen 1 Chromecast with version 1.23.82244 and still wouldn't work on version 1.23.82244 until I plugged in my Raspberry Pi with LibreELEC installed to test CEC. As soon as I plugged in the Pi, CEC started working on the Chromecast again. Weird. JD At least Google's consistent. Everything has to turn to shit.

Set in the very near future, the film envisions how a social media tech company gets so profitable and popular that it pushes the boundaries of privacy, communication, and personal freedom. Emma Watson stars as Mae who is hired by The Circle, which is the largest tech company conceivable- think Apple on steroids. It’s so large and in charge that it’s CEO, played with charm and intelligence by the always reliable Tom Hanks, encourages Mae to participate in a groundbreaking experiment in which her every move is viewed by millions across the globe. She starts to attract quite the dedicated fanbase of followers who are enamored by this new and raw form of reality television interaction. But it doesn’t stop there. The Circle combines all of your personal information in one database. There’s no separate accounts, it’s all streamlined. It can monitor your health and whereabouts at any given moment. And while that sounds appealing at first to Mae, she soon realizes that having zero privacy is not entirely ideal. While it presents so many thought-provoking concepts and ideas about our relationship and dependence on technology, The Circle is ultimately a very frustrating movie. On one hand it condemns our reliance on needing to know everything in an instant and the invasive nature of video surveillance, but it also celebrates the possibilities of technology. What could have been a fascinating Twilight-Zone type cautionary tale turns out to be sort of a self-righteous slap-on-the-hand. It feels as though it doesn’t quite know what it wants to be. While I’m all for letting audiences walk away with their own interpretation of a movie, The Circle simply isn’t as smart as it thinks it is. It’s talented cast, which includes Bill Paxton’s final performance, is sort of wasted in a mediocre rainy day rental at best. It presents so many compelling ideas that it becomes increasingly frustrating that it doesn’t follow through on many of them. If you want a tech-savvy thriller, I recommend watching Black Mirror on Netflix instead. Or if you want a social commentary on our fascination with other people’s lives, re-watch The Truman Show. Either way, it’s safe to say The Circle can be skipped. I give it a C-.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Business Google and Facebook take center stage at summit for newspaper leaders By Rick Edmonds • April 30, 2017 Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) When newspaper industry executives gather in New Orleans this evening for their annual three-day MediaXchange convention, the crowd will be thinner than at last year's edition in Washington, D.C. "(That) just reflects industry conditions coming off a difficult end to 2016," said David Chavern, CEO and president of the News Media Alliance, which organizes the convention. For those who do make it, Chavern promises plenty of practical takeaways on how to rebuild revenues. There will be some of the traditional panels and keynotes from a darkened stage, but the program also has several dozen pitches from vendors on assorted topics — a sort of 11-ring circus. "I've worked hard to set it up so it's a high-energy experience," Chavern said. "It's all in one big room, so people won't be wandering the halls looking for the next session. I hope that they go away sad that they had to miss some good things." Reading the program, I noticed that Google and Facebook each had a prime half-hour (and each signed on as a top-level platinum sponsor).  "Google and Facebook aren't going anywhere," Chavern explained, "so we might as well have them there."  Recently Chavern published a Washington Post op-ed highly critical of the two platform giants for their impact on publishers. For keynoters, Chavern picked two non-media tech specialists, Mitch Joel, a digital marketing guru, and Jonathan Perelman, a young BuzzFeed alum now running digital for ICM Partners, the showbiz talent agency. The third is Paul Taylor, who literally wrote the book on the millennial generation. Content is never the main act at these meetings, but there will be a session on covering the Trump administration and the fake news problem.  The alliance recently announced a "Support Real News" public relations campaign seeking to build added audience for the entire industry as big national organizations like The New York Times and Washington Post have already done. "There is a moment now, though I'm not sure it will be more than a moment," Chavern said, "where the broader public is paying close attention to what we have to offer. We need to be taking advantage of that." The New Orleans venue also puts participants in one of the few remaining cities with an old-fashioned newspaper war in progress. The New Orleans Advocate moved to town from its home base of Baton Rouge five years ago to challenge the Times-Picayune as that paper reduced print frequency and hasn't gone away as same skeptics had expected. The Advocate (also a platinum sponsor) will host the conference's opening reception at its new offices.  NOLA.com and the Times Picayune are having a smaller by-invitation gathering Monday at its showplace offices on the top floors of a downtown skyscraper. "We thought it a natural fit...," Advocate President and Publisher Dan Shea wrote in an email, "to support MediaXchange’s first visit to New Orleans since Katrina. The New Orleans Advocate has reached a level of growth and prominence so we wanted to be sure that the industry as a whole sees what we accomplished here." This won't be the place for downbeat assessments of the industry's prospects, but I did close a short interview with Chavern asking a version of an old Poynter seminar question — what would wild success look like for his members over the next year? He paused, then replied, "big jumps in reader revenue and getting a better deal from Google and Facebook."

The software update for the smartphone would be pushed out from early next week.  ( Samsung ) Advertisement Advertisement Android Nougat's first anniversary is coming up on Aug. 22 and with the new Android OS — allegedly dubbed Android Oreo — expected to be unveiled at Google's I/O 2017 developer's conference, several older smartphones are receiving the Android N update The latest to join the club is the T-Mobile variant of Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. On Friday, April 28, a T-Mobile official confirmed that the network operator would roll out the software update to the Samsung handset "early next week." Android N Update For Galaxy S6 edge+ T-Mobile is on a spree to roll out the Android Nougat update for the eligible devices it offers. On, April 24, the carrier rolled out the latest software update for its variant of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Come next week, T-Mobile will make the Android Nougat update available for the Galaxy S6 edge+, which released in 2015. T-Mobile's product manager Des, took to Twitter to share the news. Des did not mention any specific date that would clarify what the carrier means by "early." However, given that T-Mobile rolled out the same update for Galaxy Note 5 at the start of the week, Galaxy S6 edge+ user on the carrier can expect to receive an alert starting Monday, May 1, itself. Any Other Samsung Devices To Benefit From Android Nougat Soon? The T-Mobile official answered queries from existing subscribers and affirmed that it was working toward releasing the software update for the Samsung Galaxy S6. The network operator also shared that the Android Wear 2.0 update for the Samsung Gear S2 smartwatch was in the pipeline. Android N: Features To Look Out For Once the Galaxy S6 edge+ is upgraded to Android Nougat, users will be able to enjoy several exciting features, including multi-language support. For the unfamiliar, Android Nougat comes with multiple local language settings and offers over 1500 emojis — including the 72 new emojis promoting gender equality. Post the update, users would be able to use more than one language at the same time. The update also brings multi-window view and quick switch between apps support, which allows users to toggle between two applications and run both simultaneously. Apart from these, the "Doze on the Go" mode helps one preserve the device's battery when the handset is not in use. With the new customized quick settings of Android Nougat, Galaxy S6 edge+ users would also be able to shuffle the tiles and replace unnecessary settings with commonly-used ones. The Notification direct reply of Android N is also a handy feature and relieves one from the hassle of opening the app each time a message comes. The smartphone user can instead directly reply from the Notification alert without going into the app. TAG Samsung, Android Nougat, Android Nougat Update, T-Mobile, Galaxy S6 Edge Plus © 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Google is testing a way to make tab casting video suck a lot less, and you can try it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 1:19pm PDTApr 25, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 63 Share on Twitter Total Shares189 Chromecast Google News Google has introduced a new tweak in Chrome Dev channel for streaming full-screen video tabs to Chromecasts, significantly improving power consumption and streaming performance. Now your Chromecast can directly pull the video itself. Obviously there are lots of major and minor benefits to being able to stream any video feed to your Chromecast at higher quality. Now you can stream live feeds and videos from sources that didn't previously support Chromecast streaming, or for which the old methods resulted in a stuttery or low-quality stream. To put it simply: casting Amazon Prime (or other feeds that didn't have Chromecast support) just got better. Now we were certainly able to cast tabs before. But, the quality and performance sometimes left a bit to be desired, especially on lower-end machines. The video wasn't going straight to the Chromecast. It had to use your computer to render things locally, re-encode them, and spit them out over the network to the Chromecast. The new system trims the fat, sending supported video content bitstreams directly, mitigating the overhead and improving performance while also decreasing the processing power required by the host machine. The changes are exclusive to the developer channel release of Chrome for now, and they require that you flip a flag in chrome://flags/#media-remoting to enable the feature. I was able to get it working on an old potato laptop with Amazon Prime, Adult Swim, and a few other services that don't have native Chromecast support. Before the "Cast a tab" streaming resulted in a laggy mess that sucked my underpowered laptop's battery dry. Now things are buttery smooth on both my TV and my ancient computer. It might still suck that Amazon doesn't want users of its services to watch stuff on Chromecasts, but if you are using one anyway through the various workarounds like chrome's tab streaming, then things should be a bit smoother for you now. Binge-watching The Man in the High Castle just got a tiny bit better. Source: Google+ Tags casting chromecast dev channel streaming subscribe ...

Mysticode Is 5.1 audio supported? DarthHaro I believe so makapav Good point. Chromecast in general sucks with 5.1 sources. Benoit Bourdua I have seen a page lately saying its possible to get hd audio formats to play through Plex (but have yet to try it) so the Chromecast looks like it's able to deal with a lot. makapav I have both, Plex on PC and Nvidia SATV. Take it with a pinch of salt. Ryne Hager I do not know, actually. I know the Chromecasts should support it, but I can't verify and don't have the tools to test that 5.1 channel audio from a tab works. TechGuy22 MKV supported ? i know my shield doesn't play them through chromecast Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Probably not as it doesn't fall under the list of supported formats: https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media TechGuy22 lame 4Ui812 It's not lame , It's Google. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It might be supported from a technical standpoint as MKV is only a container for data, but the video files within would need be in a supported codec like VP8 or H.264. John Rename it to MP4. ddevito Chrome for Android needs better casting functionality. For example, I'd like the ability to cast the page(s) I'm surfing but cast it full screen on my TV (not simply casting my phone's display) Ryne Hager I'd love to see it improved on mobile, too. Alejandro What ? How can you cast a webpage on Android? I thought you could only cast the entire screen, unlike the desktop version of chrome. ddevito Yes, exactly. That's what I'd like to see get added Alejandro The last part you mentioned got me confused, sorry Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ But why not casting the whole display? There is literally no difference? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7d76a0ecedcec617e108bc3d0216a7dc189878e7921186fbafd0c1b5f50ae5f3.gif ddevito Yes there is. I don't want to see my Navi buttons, my notifications or the tray. I just want to see the content. I also want it to expand to the width of my TV. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Okay okay, maybe the Immersive Mode app could help you with this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmd.immersive mma173 e.g. you might want to show friends a website and still be able to navigate through your phone without them seeing your private content. SilentException I'm actually on Chrome Beta channel (v58 x64) and have that option as well. Nice tip! Although, this is the way it should have been working from the beginning :) Andy J For supported content yes, but even this method is only going to be useful for mp4 videos, pretty much everything else is still going to have to re-encoded by the computer and then streamed to the Chromecast. Bombaglad tmithc is awesome! T4rd Nice.. now I'll be able to cast Amazon Prime videos whether they like it or not. =p Ryne Hager And they won't be a stuttery mess! Richard Riker At least as long as Amazon doesn't find a way around that, to deliver them in a format Chromecast doesn't support or so... At least I wouldn't be surprised Ryne Hager I know, I'm just waiting for them to break it. Carson Saldanha When will we be able to natively cast the same thing to two different Chromecasts on Chrome? Carson Saldanha Need this for Google Slides John Doe It did not work for me on Amazon prime, I tried The Man in the High Castle and it also did not work on all Vimeo videos that I tried. I am running latest Chrome on Macbook pro. It doesn't even try with Amazon prime and on a few Vimeo videos it tries but then it ends up playing on both devices like it used to. I am not running the chrome dev channel but I was able to enable the flag in the stable version of chrome. hiram lowe I guess thats what you get for not following instructions then. John Doe It does work with a few videos in Vimeo...pay attention. Maxr1998 Great improvement, can't wait to try it out! Oh, and I'd so much binge-watch The Man in the High Castle, if I hadn't finished it already :D Great show! makapav > old potato laptop Laughed way too much at that description. Derp Can they PLEASE fix the mess that is YouTube casting. Bruce Wayne What's wrong with it? Lonerwithaboner420 It's laggy as hell and the sound is all jacked up Bruce Wayne What device are you casting to and from? Lonerwithaboner420 TV from fully updated PC Chrome. Bruce Wayne Is it a TV with Android TV or a Chromecast connected to the TV? Lonerwithaboner420 Chromecast Bruce Wayne Ah, yeah. I've heard that too. Especially on the 1st generation Chromecast. I cast to an Sony 4K TV with Android TV built in and streaming is smooth. I don't think they're ever going to fix the issue with the Chromecast. Lonerwithaboner420 I'm not what sure generation I have, got it last year, but either way that problem shouldn't exist. Thank god theyre fixing the issue in the article. Streaming live sports is painful the way it is now. David Hyman I used to care about amazon video not being on chromecast until i realized that my smart tv streams prime in 4k. its way too hard to go back :) Benoit Bourdua Great news! Should help with streaming sport events. Look forward to trying it. Dan It's cool that they are adding streaming the content directly but this doesn't mean we can cast Amazon now. The Chromecast pulls streams directly from the provider so unless they support syncing your account information which Amazon won't. It will just get blocked. As if you just tried pasting the address of a video stream in to a browser that doesn't have your cookie information. All of which something a technology writer should know... Andy J I'm not sure why you think that - the way these things tend to work these days - is that when you are logged in and you start to stream, you are provided a unique URL for your account, or you are provided the same CDN url as everyone else but with nonces and extra security added on the end so the CDN can verify it's really you. Dan The specifics of the mechanics change nothing. Amazon doesn't provide for it and Google isn't going to build circumvention into their browser. Portzblitz Been over the flag list twice. Even searched in-page! Please help; is it actually called "media remoting"? Andy J Yup I just copied it and then opened a new tab and pasted it in and it was there, there is another one underneath it to allow you to send encrypted content directly to the Chromecast too. But my (STABLE) Chrome updated to v58 yesterday, so check you are at least on v58 first. I'm just going to restart now and see if it works on stable despite the article saying it's exclusive to the dev channel. Edit - I'm back and it's working on STABLE v58. Portzblitz Thanks, cheers. I'll try again. Stable too.. I simply must watch my European football on a big screen! Vesuvius Do you use Acestream? The quality is superb Seusk Don't know if this is new or not, but the Netflix cast a tab support is great!! Andy J Just to say it's working here on v58 on the STABLE channel - build 58.0.3029.81 (64-bit) Naxx ENVY it works! and its awesome John Does it support non-embedded subtitles? Ty I just got the Dev build, I enabled the flag, but I tested it on amazon prime video and I cant tell that it's working. I can still see my mouse on the screen. I am trying it with TNT (watching the playoffs), and that seems to definitely not be working. Can anyone confirm this?

They were all ready to set the market on fire with the awesomeness of the last Note 7. But the market literally caught fire as the phablet proved too hot to handle. The S8 has to recover not just the goodwill but also all that lost business to Google, LG and OnePlus. First impressions The S8 is an evolution of the previous model with one big change: they have made it narrow. It is supremely comfortable to hold and even better to use when wearing formal pants. The tall, slender dimensions are perfect for holding in the palm. For the past two weeks this phone served me in everything I needed. It worked and worked and impressed. It's the first Samsung phone I am actually contemplating owning. Yet, there are a couple of caveats. Design The fingerprint sensor is awkwardly placed on the back, off-centre to the camera lens. You smudge the camera while hunting for the not-at-all-natural position where your finger rests. This can get annoying when I have to unlock the phone hundreds of times a day. I can alternately use the excellent face detection or the new-fangled iris scanner. But how many of you like to pick up a phone, stare at it and wait for action? Didn't think so. Awkward positioning of fingerprint sensor means you’re stroking the camera a lot. Display Then there is the bezel free glass everywhere with much of it drooping over the edges. Nervous? Yes. Wrap it up in a rubberized cover? Then the whole point of it looking so fantastic is moot. Gone. Poof. The back is glass also which makes it more worrying. It's like dating a supermodel. The 5.8 inch display is almost bezel free. That massive yet visually compact Amoled display has a density of 507ppi, more than you can make out with your naked eye. Screen legibility in the sunlight is the best I've seen on any device yet. The physical home button is finally gone. Having to rely on on-screen controls is perfectly natural. And in a couple of years, everybody will have forgotten about that button just like the Windows help assistant Clippy. Who? That's right. Special features Bixby is a three-part assistant/utility aimed to be like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. Then there is Bixby Home, similar to Google Now. It provides information updates for appointments, workout counts, news headlines, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter updates. Rounding it up is Bixby Vision which is a camera filter. Scan business cards or translate into 52 languages with more or less varying results. But for all this, you need to sign up for a Samsung account. Camera Can it make you popular on Instagram? This is one of the main reasons for buying mobile phones these days. No dual camera on this but do you really need two? The 12MP camera is consistently fantastic. Shutter lag time is negligible allowing you to snap away instantly. Double tap the power button and you can have the camera ready to shoot in 0.8 seconds consistently. Samsung finally implemented this standard Android feature. What sets it apart from the S7 and dual lens options is the officially titled "Multi-Frame Image Processing". Here the phone captures many images with one tap and merges them for a single clear, sharp image. Photos are crisp and accurately coloured. The dynamic range is excellent and it's coupled with a pleasing image sharpening effect. You can take them in default JPEG or RAW if you feel the need to tweak them much further on a PC later on. A pro mode helps you tweak the settings much more than the majority of the S8 users will attempt. But the auto setting is more than enough for most. One highlight is the Portrait option that detects a face and blurs out the background for more attention to the subject, similar to the iPhone 7. Go overboard and you may end up cutting off someone's limbs and ears. What the dual lenses on competing devices offer is better depth of field effect for portraits but frankly, the S8 manages perfectly well. Videos are shot in 1080p HD which you can move up to quad HD (1440p) at the cost of video stabilization. Not everyone has said goodbye to the headphone jack, yet. Battery Now onto the hot stuff. You may be wondering if you need to wear a fireman's outfit for using this device. Samsung hasn't provided one yet and I can assure you that while the device does get a little warm like most other phones during heavy usage, it has not set my pockets on fire. But the price will. Battery drain tests averaged 16 hours of looped video. The S7 which had an excellent battery backup could manage that at 14.5 hours. In daily usage considering our network issues, the phone easily lasts an entire day during average use but if you play games a lot, prepare to top up once.      SPECS Corning Gorilla Glass 5 front and back Single SIM (Nano-SIM) or Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by) IP68 certified - dust/water proof over 1.5 meter and 30 minutes 5.8 Super Amoled 1440 x 2960 pixels (~570 ppi pixel density) Always-on display OS: Android 7.0 (Nougat) Chipset: Exynos 8895 Octacore GPU: Mali-G71 Memory: microSD, up to 256 GB (dedicated slot) - single-SIM model Internal: 64 GB, 4 GB RAM Camera: 12 MP rear, f/1.7, 26mm, phase detection autofocus, OIS. 1/2.5" sensor size. Simultaneous 4K video and 9MP image recording, 2160p@30fps/1080p@60fps video. 8 MP front, f/1.7, autofocus, 1440p@30fps video. Connectivity: Bluetooth5.0, NFC, USB 3.1 Type-C Sensors: Iris scanner, fingerprint (rear-mounted), barometer, heart rate. Battery: Non-removable Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery Colours: Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue, Maple Gold Price (as of May 2017) S8: 77,900 tk S8+: 83,900 tk     VERDICT Samsung has made one of the best looking phones in the market right now. It's the make-your-friends-go-jealous type. The narrow form factor is perfect for ergonomics. I never did like big wide phones like the Google Pixel or the One Plus 2. It's faster than you will ever need it to be. AnTuTu scores are 164368 for my test unit. Camera is good enough to be among the top five flagships right now. It's almost perfect except for that super annoying fingerprint sensor.  But if you are an S7 user, there is not that much performance upgrades for you to switch other than the novelty factor. It's fresh, it's cool. On the plus side, the battery fears are put to rest. Before you get one though, take the fingerprint unit on a test run. It is not a deal breaker but it can get annoying. And after you have bought it for its looks, hide it behind a cover because it is curved glass everywhere.  Check online for photo samples and more in-depth review.  The Daily Star Breaking news alert on your phone.

Panneerselvan May 01, 2017 00:02 IST Updated: April 30, 2017 23:40 IST more-in The vexatious questions that arise from the contested interface between digital technologies and journalism In philosophy, the accent is on coming up with a right question. The underlying principle is that there is an answer to every right question. At some level, questioning is cerebral. However, providing answers is the task of sloggers. They have to delve deep into available literature, triangulate multiple strands to eliminate internal contradictions, and provide a clue that is consistent with both the legal and ethical frameworks. One of the frequent requests we receive is for a takedown of a particular story from our digital archive. These readers invoke the right to be forgotten and often cite the European Court of Justice’s 2014 judgment that directed the search engine, Google, to remove thousands of web links. The primacy of privacy supersedes freedom of expression and the accuracy of historical record in this judgment. Why does this newspaper not encourage takedown requests? Does the non-existence of a particular material online erase it from all other forms of archiving? What about the existence of the physical newspaper, with the content that some readers want to take down, that exists not only in the newspaper’s office but also across various public libraries? Is the onus of monitoring and restricting a specific web link the job of a search engine? If a particular string is blocked by an algorithm, what prevents the interested parties from creating parallel strings to keep the expunged content alive online? Is it not important to remember the observation of the founders of Google: “The web is a vast collection of completely uncontrolled heterogeneous collections”? For a transformative change A scholar I rely on when dealing with the vexatious questions that arise from the contested interface between digital technologies and journalism is George Brock, a well-known journalist who worked for the Observer and The Times. Mr. Brock is now the head of the Graduate School of Journalism at City University, London and he served as president of the World Editors Forum. His 2013 book, Out of Print, argued that journalism can flourish in a new digital world if it is willing to adopt a transformative change while retaining its four core tasks: verification, sense-making, eye-witness and investigation. Mr. Brock in his last book, The Right to be Forgotten (Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford) looked at the rules that govern the preservation of information of public value, its contours and boundaries, and did not restrict himself to only what is in public interest now but what might be of interest in the future. He explains the power data harvesters have to alter the normal effects of the passage of time in the present context where information never fades into the past but often returns to the present with a keystroke. He wryly cites Lucas D. Introna and Helen Nissenbaum: “In twenty first century life, to exist is to be indexed by a search engine.” He concedes that there are problems that flow from this instant retrieval system where the information has a perpetual existence. For him, the issue goes beyond immediate concerns such as “censorship” or “deleting history on any scale”. He is rightly worried about ratchet moves that can extend the law’s grasp to shrink free expression. The carelessness of tech giants, with the unintended consequences of data protection, he argues, may have been the moral force behind legal restraint. But, he asserts, that should not lead to a situation that falls much short of the basic legal tenet of “specific and proportionate remedies for identifiable wrongs”. Mr. Brock looks at a range of court cases, requests for delisting, the response of the search engines and the new growing industry of attorneys who claim that their efforts have led “to the successful removal of links that include information relating to past/spent convictions, disciplinary sanctions, offensive blog articles, news reports, private/intimate images, work place investigations and employment disputes”. He explains that the Google Spain case was not about defamation, which remains an expensive area of law; that it was not about inaccurate information as there was no dispute as to the newspaper’s original announcement; that it was not about wrongful release of private information as the announcement was meant to be public; and that it was not about information doing harm. It was about the petitioner’s claim that he had been embarrassed, which the court made it clear was not a requirement to de-index, yet which gave a verdict that may put free speech and journalism on a slippery slope.   readerseditor@thehindu.co.in Post a Comment More In Columns Readers' Editor Readers' Editor media Related Articles << Previous Story Malleable information is not journalism Next Story >> Please Wait while comments are loading...

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Guest This is the time to bet on enterprise tech Kyle Poyar, OpenView Partners@poyark April 30, 2017 10:25 AM Image Credit: Panchenko Vladimir/Shutterstock Recent history alone should be enough to prove that enterprise tech is a far more stable, profitable category than consumer tech. Take for instance the dozens of successful exits (either through acquisition or IPO) in the U.S. enterprise tech space in just 2016 and 2017. By contrast, the U.S. consumer tech space has seen only a handful of successful outcomes over the same time period. Above: 2016 and 2017 acquisitions and IPOs of U.S. based companies without previously successful exits. Acquisitions include companies sold for more than $400 million. The disparity between enterprise and consumer tech companies (using financial outcome as the marker) comes primarily from the many exit options that exist for the former well beyond an IPO. By contrast, acquisitions that provide investors with outsized returns in the consumer tech space can really only be made by a handful of companies – typically just Google, Facebook, and Amazon. In 2016, I count roughly 70 U.S. technology exits and acquisitions of more than $100 million. All but six were enterprise tech. The table above gives you a sampling, displaying companies that were acquired for at least $400 million. When technology companies – either consumer or enterprise – do go public, the market has traditionally favored enterprise companies because they have a clear path to delivering shareholder value. Nine out of 10 enterprise tech IPOs in 2016 ended the year in the black – the basket finished 39.8 percent above where it debuted. The one recent consumer tech IPO, Snap, dropped nearly 7 percent in a day after Facebook announced copycat features. On the other hand, enterprise companies like Acacia Communications were profitable at IPO or plan to be profitable within two years of going public. Snap reported losses of $514 million compared to revenue of just $404 million in 2016 and warns it may never be profitable. Over the years, entire consumer categories have gone up in smoke. Flash sales (Gilt), couponing (Groupon), localization (Foursquare), and social media (Twitter) have shown themselves to be categories fraught with euphoric highs early in life, but they languish as the novelty wears off and competitors emerge and land grab. On the other hand, SaaS dollar retention rates are often at or above 100 percent, which means many enterprise companies could actually turn off all sales and marketing spend and still continue to grow! This stability comes from a high cost of switching providers and the low price sensitivity of many buyers. Meanwhile, much of consumer tech lives and dies by ad revenue (think Google, Facebook, Snap, Twitter), making it more susceptible to market turns and changes in user behavior. Consumer tech verticals where revenue is driven by consumer spend (food delivery, for example) have struggled, too, because of low retention. With VCs falling over themselves to win deals in this space, competitors abound, which further drives down the costs of switching providers. This phenomenon (both exuberance from VCs and lack of brand loyalty from consumers) is evident in countless consumer markets like ridesharing, on-demand services, and dating sites. But it’s not just the stability and clear path towards success that make enterprise tech a sure bet. There’s also a unique community that’s emerged in the enterprise tech space, and participants have both the ability and the willingness to share best practices across companies since, unlike in consumer tech, moats in the SaaS space can be maintained relatively well. In the marketing automation space, for example, there’s been room for HubSpot, Marketo, Eloqua, and Pardot to all have successful outcomes since these companies focus on particular market segments with distinct value propositions. And HubSpot contributes to the industry’s success by funding inbound.org, an online community of 200,000+ marketers. The same thing has happened for eCommerce platforms, business intelligence, and many other categories. This knowledge sharing also allows for benchmarking across companies, which helps everyone identify gaps and areas of improvement. A rising tide lifts all boats as they say. For these reasons enterprise tech is more of a sure bet than ever. Kyle Poyar is Director of Market Strategy at OpenView, an expansion stage VC firm.

Print Story X Print Story Business April 30, 2017 Share Advertisement Google’s search for non-ad revenue puts spotlight on cloud, Pixel NEW YORK: The business now represents about 13 percent of Alphabet's total revenue, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but definitely shines a light on Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc. "(Google) is doing a good job, a much better job in diversifying revenue than Facebook is," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "We think that is quite an impressive achievement." Alphabet does not break out revenue contribution within the "Other Revenue" segment. But analysts have said that cloud is the most prominent among the category's clutch of businesses. To be sure, Google's cloud venture is still much smaller than market leader Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp's Azure. But Google is investing heavily. "In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in cloud," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Amazon's cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft's cloud unit grew 93 percent. "We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google's hardware products, we see Google's 'other' revenue growing 38 percent to nearly $14 billion in 2017," Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com When Cars Fly? Uber Wants To Test On-Demand Air Transport by 2020 By Sam Levin PUBLISHED: APRIL 30 2017 Uber said it plans to test flying cars by 2020, with the goal of eventually enabling customers to "push a button and get a high-speed flight in and around cities." The embattled ride-sharing company, which is facing a high-stakes intellectual property lawsuit over its self-driving car technology, said it is partnering with aircraft manufacturers to develop an "on-demand" network of "vertical take-off and landing vehicles." The announcement at the company's inaugural Elevate Summit in Dallas on Tuesday marks Uber's latest push to transform urban transportation, following numerous controversial programs that have led to high-profile conflicts with governments across the globe. Many questions remain about how flying cars will work and how cities will regulate the technology and on-demand systems. The San Francisco-based company has a long history of openly flouting regulations and defying existing laws that control the taxi industry and govern the testing of autonomous vehicles. Uber's first partner cities for the Elevate project are Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Dubai. In Texas, local officials have pledged to make the metro area the first in the US to explore a pilot project for this kind of technology. In the United Arab Emirates, Uber has launched a partnership with the Dubai Road and Transport Authority, which is funding studies on pricing and demand in the region. Uber aims to demo its technology at a 2020 World Expo that Dubai is hosting. The company said it also plans to work with real estate companies to "identify sites and construct vertiports" for what it's calling the Uber Elevate Network. The company said it is also partnering with aircraft manufacturers that are developing electric vertical take-off and landing cars. The summit comes at a time when Uber is facing a high-stakes lawsuit from Google's self-driving car project, with a case that could pose an existential threat to the company. Uber is accused of brazenly stealing vital trade secrets from Waymo, Google's self-driving car entity, and if Google's lawyers are successful in court, the case could block Uber from moving forward with autonomous vehicles. CEO Travis Kalanick, who has suffered a string of scandals in recent months, has said that self-driving cars are critical to Uber's business model in the long term. Uber expressed interest in flying cars last year with a white paper claiming that the technology will help ease congestion in cities. The paper claimed that "on-demand aviation" could "radically improve urban mobility" and shorten people's commutes. Some have raised questions about the noise problems that could come with flying cars in cities, and as part of its summit, Uber has scheduled a session on the subject. There are also questions about how cities and other government entities will regulate the testing and implementation of the technology and how the cars could conform to existing certification processes and air traffic control systems. Last year, US regulators gave approval for the testing of the world's first passenger drone capable of autonomously carrying a person. The US Federal Aviation Administration also approved test flights for flying cars in 2015. Jeff Holden, chief product officer at Uber, claimed in a statement that the technology will support "the reduction of congestion and pollution from transportation, giving people their time back, freeing up real estate dedicated to parking and providing access to mobility in all corners of a city." © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Toyota Shows Robotic Leg Brace Next Article > Amazon Sees Echo and Alexa as Its Biggest Opportunity By Jennifer Van Grove PUBLISHED: APRIL 29 2017 Without revealing specifics, Amazon executives Thursday offered the biggest clue yet that Amazon Echo products are kind of a big deal. In a conference call with analysts highlighting its first-quarter results, Amazon specifically called out its voice-based devices, which are powered by an artificial intelligence platform referred to colloquially as "Alexa," as its No. 1 opportunity. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the e-commerce company is "doubling down" on its investment in Amazon Echo products, meaning it plans to spend big to improve the technology and get more Echo units into more homes. "We're very encouraged by the customer response to Echo products," he said. But as for actually making money from them, "that's not our primary issue right now." The statements, coming a day after the launch of Amazon's Echo Look hands-free camera, further confirm that the company has no plans to back off from this nascent business, despite the fact that device sales aren't yet padding the company's profit margins. Though Amazon has never disclosed sales figures, third-party research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that 8.2 million U.S. consumers own the original Echo, the smaller Echo Dot or the portable Echo Tap. On the whole, Amazon reported $35.7 billion in net sales and $724 million in net income for the first three months of 2017, with both results coming in higher than analysts' predictions. In addition to shelling out on Echo development, Amazon also signaled on the conference call that video remains a top area of interest, meaning consumers should expect a continued back-and-forth with Netflix in the content department. In fact, spending on video content and related marketing -- as in inking pricey licensing deals like the one with the NFL for Thursday night games -- was listed second by Olsavsky as he rattled off the company's areas for increased spending. Amazon recently started selling its Prime Video product as a standalone streaming service for $9 per month. Previously, the company had only bundled the digital video perk, which includes access to award-winning original shows, with its annual Prime subscription. This year, Amazon Video is anticipated to reach 85.3 million viewers in the United States -- or nearly 12 percent more than last year -- according to digital analytics firm eMarketer, which assumes that there are 2.5 viewers for every 1 paid subscription. © 2017 San Diego Union-Tribune under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

(stock photo) Steve Dempsey Twitter April 30 2017 6:00 PM 0 Comments Steve Dempsey: Google ad-block and news switch will put 'truth' in its hands and hit publishers Independent.ie Google is flexing its muscles at the moment, in an effort to cut down on bad ads and fake news. It has changed its search algorithm to combat fake news, and is reportedly going to add ad blocking to its Chrome browser. People searching for news online should be shown more reliable stories, and they should be less likely to have to wade through pop-ups and pre-roll ads to consume it. It's win-win, right? http://www.independent.ie/business/media/steve-dempsey-google-adblock-and-news-switch-will-put-truth-in-its-hands-and-hit-publishers-35666744.html http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article35666584.ece/0c2c4/AUTOCROP/h342/6dempsey.jpg Email Google is flexing its muscles at the moment, in an effort to cut down on bad ads and fake news. It has changed its search algorithm to combat fake news, and is reportedly going to add ad blocking to its Chrome browser. People searching for news online should be shown more reliable stories, and they should be less likely to have to wade through pop-ups and pre-roll ads to consume it. It's win-win, right? Well, certainly for Google and probably for users too. However what Google's up to illustrates two changes - each at opposite ends of the digital news ecosystem that illustrate the dangers of one company having so much influence. Who gets squeezed in the middle? You guessed it - the publishers. Let's take Google's latest plans for its Chrome browser. Last week reports emerged that Google planned to add an ad-blocking feature to the mobile and desktop versions of Chrome - by far the most popular browser on the planet, according to NetMarketShare. Ad blocking would be switched on by default, meaning Chrome users would no longer see unacceptable ads. So what ads are unacceptable, and who makes that call? The answer is the Coalition For Better Ads - an industry group comprising big brands, publishers and ad tech companies. Facebook, Newscorp, Omnicom, Digital Content Next, and the Washington Post are all onboard. So too is Google. The coalition has found four types of desktop ads and eight types of mobile web ads that should be axed. These include auto playing video ads with sound, pop-up ads, and large sticky ads. In theory, this should be good news for publishers. The less annoying their ads, the more likely they are to retain users. And across the board, if the online advertising industry stops peddling crappy ad experiences, surely those with the most to gain are the biggest websites. But the most irritating ads are often the most effective ones from an advertiser perspective. This is especially if advertisers are measuring success through basic metrics like viewability and clickthroughs and not considering the quality of their campaigns - which is often the real reason why online ads are such a poor experience. One other point of note. It's unclear how the Chrome ad blocker will function. It may block any ad formats that have been blacklisted, or it's also been suggested it may block any sites which carry blacklisted ads. Websites with any offending ads, therefore, could be blocked entirely on Google's browser. Let's forget about ad blocking for a minute and move over to fake news. This week Google updated its search algorithm to make fake news harder to find, and authoritative sources more visible. Links to false and offensive stories will be lower down in search results and Google's army of raters that assess the validity of search results are now flagging "low-quality" content. Google has also updated its auto-complete function. This feature which completes search queries based on popularity will no longer generate offensive search suggestions, and users will be able to flag problematic search suggestions. But here's the thing. Google hasn't gone into any specifics. There's no detail on how a page is deemed to have more authority on one subject than another. The algorithm will decide what's most relevant, most authoritative and most true. And the algorithm is a mystery. Here's how Ben Thompson, who writes brilliantly on technology and business strategy, put it : "The single most important resource for finding the truth, one that is dominant in its space thanks to the fact that being bigger inherently means being better, is making decisions about what is true without a shred of transparency." Despite the lack of transparency, online news publishers may have reason to celebrate. You'd expect them to be given a leg up by Google when it comes to deciding on authority. But here's the thing: what happens when Google starts prioritising one source - say an outlet with a particular editorial bias - over other websites? How will Google differentiate between different versions of the truth? The net effect of Google's ad blocking and algorithm updates is this: Google is increasing its control over the ads that are served to users, while at the same time it has a virtual monopoly on the technology that publishers use to serve those ads - almost all news publishing sites use, and pay for, Google technology to serve their ads. At the same time it is upping its influence on search results for news related searches, but with less and less transparency. Google is turning the dials at either ends of the news business - changing how consumers find the news they search for on the open web, and changing how publishers can monetise their audience through advertising. The search giant is doing nothing wrong here. Indeed, it has users' interests at heart. But the algorithm update and the change to Chrome illustrates how much control Google has over the news industry. There may be unintended consequences for publishers which rely on Google for both reach and revenue. Smaller niche publishers may find it harder to survive. Larger publishers may see revenues fall. Others may become more reliant on the likes of Facebook as a distribution channel. Media plurality may suffer. When Google sneezes, some news organisations may freeze.

Google posted more of the 2017 I/O schedule, time to plan your own Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/28 3:24pm PDTApr 28, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 117 Share on Facebook 63 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 Android OS Development Google News More of this year's schedule for Google's I/O developer conference is finally up. At least, more than the last time we talked about it. Not all of the events are on it, as some would likely give away announcements made during the keynote at I/O by their presence on the calendar, but it looks like most of the talks should be there now. If you are planning on attending, as some of us are, then you might want to start figuring out how best to divide up your time. Some of the time slots have 12 different events, so the odds are very likely that you won't be able to make every single talk you want. Things kick off May 17th with a breakfast before the Keynote at 10 AM. The developer keynote follows that at 1 PM after a break for lunch, though there are some talks available during lunch if the subjects appeal to you, or the food doesn't. For the rest of that day and the other two, though, you're on your own to find out what you'd like to attend. Remember that some of the talks will require that you reserve a seat. The schedule will continue to be updated as we get closer to the event. Those of us who may not be there should still take a look, as Google also streams some of the other events and sessions at I/O. That means even if you weren't able to make it to the event, you can still get your developer thing on. The talks that will be streamed are marked on the schedule with a little camera icon, still leaving you with entirely too many choices. If you end up with a scheduling conflict you can always go back and watch some of the old recordings. With that, you might want to prioritize to attend things that aren't being recorded, like the "Office Hours," if you have any unwanted overlap. Another option for those that can't attend are the I/O Extended events. Feel free to check and see if any are being hosted near you. I'll probably be attending the show this way, myself. The official I/O app hasn't been updated for 2017 yet, but feel free to pull it down in anticipation via the attractive widget below, or over at APKMirror. Google has a pretty nice set of tools put together, both in the app and online, for managing your I/O schedule. With the wide selection of talks and events, it's a really good idea to use them. For the full details, to plan your schedule, or to just lament not going, feel free to check out the source link below. Download QR-Code Google I/O 2016 Developer: Google Inc.

Every organization reflects the values of its leader. A lengthy article in the New York Times last weekend makes Uber founder Travis Kalanick sound like little more than a horse’s ass. The Times puff piece apologizes for poor little rich kid Travis who was cruelly bullied as a child. The suggestion is the experience toughened him up and made him into the clear eyed genius who created the world’s most successful ride hailing business, valued today at somewhere around $70 billion. The fact that a company with an app can be worth more than General Motors or Tesla is a commentary on the bubbling, seething culture of tech startups — a culture that is lampooned brilliantly by the NetFlix series, Silicon Valley. Uber has adopted a highly combative corporate style to fend off any and all attempts by local authorities to regulate it. For years, it has employed a program known as Greyball to avoid surveillance by officials. The program identifies those suspected of being government watchdogs and sends them false or misleading information about Uber cars in their area. Often, the company software ends up cancelling a request for a ride from someone it considers suspicious. Uber says it developed the Grayball software to thwart people who might make its drivers targets of physical harm and to keep competitors from acquiring proprietary information about the company and its operations. Authorities like Ted Wheeler, the mayor of Portland, Oregon, see it differently. Wheeler says, “I am very concerned that Uber may have purposefully worked to thwart the city’s job to protect the public.” Recently, Uber has been torched by allegations that there is a culture of sexual harassment within the company. After initially denying the allegations, Kalanick later yielded to pressure and announced a top to bottom review of company personnel procedures. More recently, Uber stepped into another pile of trouble after Apple discovered it was using a process known as “fingerprinting” to monitor the phones of Uber users who had downloaded the Uber app to their smartphones even after the app was deleted and the phones were restarted. That landed Kalanick in hot water with Apple CEO Tim Cook, who invited him to a private meeting and told him to stop using the process or Apple would block the app from every iPhone in the world, according to the New York Times. Kalanick agreed to do so but has since fired back at the suggestion it did anything wrong. It says the “fingerprinting” process is a common industry practice. Mark Cuban, who is an investor in Uber, tells the New York Times, “Travis’ biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goal.” Then Cuban adds, “Travis’ greatest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goal.” Former colleagues describe him as being “emotionally unintelligent.” He has organized staff meetings to discuss how to take down competitors, including Lyft, Uber’s biggest rival. Kalanick was filmed having a violent argument with an Uber driver earlier this year after the driver suggested the company’s compensation package was inadequate. Uber is known for cutting back on the percentage it pays its drivers. When putative president Donald Trump issued his first travel ban, taxi drivers in New York City called a one hour strike to protest the treatment of immigrants. Uber responded by sending as many drivers as possible to JFK airport, a move that earned it scorn from the public. Millions of people deleted their Uber app as a result. Last week, another storm broke over the company when it was learned that Unroll.me, a free e-mail organizing service, was selling customer data to Uber that would allow it to determine how many people were using Lyft in a given area. That sort of mania for spying on the competition is endemic at Uber. Uber’s business model is to browbeat government officials, competitors, customers, women, and its own drivers into submission as it pursues absolute dominance in the ride hailing business. Elon Musk recently referred to the new Tesla Network that’s coming soon as “the people versus Uber.” Being an overbearing, anti-social jerk may be one way to get a business off the ground, but being loathed by people how have been bludgeoned by the company’s scorched earth policies in the past may not be a good strategy for long term success.     Share: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Tags: Apple user ID, electronic fingerprinting, Greyball technology, Travis Kalanick, Uber ride hailing service About the Author Steve Hanley I have been a car nut since the days when Rob Walker and Henry N.

Knowledge is power and there is alot of knowledge hidden in books. So, what books have you read and how have they changed you? Which ones are a must read? Here are some recommendations. Advertisement By Full Woman Eugene Mugisha Who Moved My Cheese, by Spencer Johnson. It is about accepting change as a part of life and adapting to it. It shows the difference between those who adapt, those who refuse and those who fail to recognise and accept change. Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, by Douglas Rushkoff. It is about understanding the digital economy, its promises, its shortcomings and its cost to prosperity. I would not speak for what the books will do for those who read them. My experience was more of an eye opener, especially for Who Moved My Cheese. Change is a constant part of life, something that should be embraced, accepted instead of resisting it. For Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, it gives insight on day-to-day trends, as affected and influenced by digital technologies. Benjie This one is about two to three years old but the message never gets old. Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg. For every woman that’s trying to pursue a dream or move the career ladder while not losing sight of her family obligations. I love it because it speaks to men as well, and how they can influence the professional success of their partners and they too benefit from it by having happy families. Every working and ambitious family person needs to read this book. Another one that I recommend is Pedagogy of the Oppressed, by Paul Freire. This, for the simple fact that it will change your outlook on education and help you appreciate your role in changing it, especially if, like me, you are frustrated by the education system and wish you could do something to fix it. Andrew Wallace This is a disclaimer; I haven’t read these books personally, but I’m blessed to know a couple of people hooked to reading motivational books and the two books I mention below come highly recommended from my ‘sources’. One: The Art of Asking: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Let People Help. I liked this particular one mainly because some women today are allegedly independent and therefore don’t need any help, especially from men. Author Amanda Palmer, proves them all wrong in this book. She redefines and challenges independent women on the power of give and take. Two: One Day My Soul Just Opened Up by Iyanla Vanzant. The author is that super-frank girlfriend who tells you to get your act together, no matter how much you don’t want to hear it. Based on her personal experience. I thought this one would be a good read for women who lack self-awareness and therefore need to boost their confidence as they work toward the life they really want. The book also gives you a spiritual boost and guidance on how to deal business, relationships etc. The guys Ivan Okuda: 23, at University. Benjie: 27, single Eugene Mugisha: 29, the dating guru.

Huawei Mate 9 review addendum: Alexa is a flop, but it's still a great phone Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 10:31am PDTApr 11, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 22 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Huawei Mate 9 Phone Reviews Reviews Huawei used to avoid releasing high-end phones in the US, but no more. The Mate 9 was launched in the US several months ago, and it was announced as the very first phone to have Amazon's Alexa built in. However, that wasn't ready at launch, and Huawei didn't even know exactly when it would be available. Alexa finally rolled out to the Mate 9 several weeks ago, but Google sort of cut Amazon off at the knees by launching Assistant on the Mate 9 and many other phones while we were waiting for this update. As I noted in the original Mate 9 review, this is a good phone—Huawei has really turned things around in the software, the battery life is killer, and the build quality is top notch. However, Alexa doesn't add much to this phone; in fact, it's kind of a flop. Still, the Mate 9 is one of my favorite phones right now. Hardware and performance I've used the Mate 9 on a regular basis since the review, which means I've loaded it up with all my usual apps and junk. I've also used it to test innumerable apps. You may have noticed all my YouTube TV screenshots were taken on the Mate 9, for example. Even with all that, the phone performs just as well now as it did when it was fresh out of the box. Plenty of phones seem fast and long-lived when you first get your hands on them, but that changes a couple months down the line. You might load a phone up with files and apps only to find it's not the speedy hot rod you unboxed. I'm happy to say this has not been my experience with the Mate 9. I haven't detected any noticeable slow downs; apps are still quick to open, animations play fluidly, and even split-screen apps don't bog the phone down. This device is powered by Huawei's custom Kirin 960 SoC, which is an octa-core chip with four Cortex-A73 cores (the latest from ARM) and four Cortex-A53 cores. Performance in benchmarks is close to the Snapdragon 821, and it feels about as fast as most devices I've used with that chip. The Pixel is still a bit faster, but the Mate 9 is easily as snappy as something like the LG G6. One of my favorite things about the Mate 9 when I reviewed it was the monster battery life. It's still monstrously good, which makes me very happy. I can use this phone for days at a time without plugging it in. Even if I use it rather heavily, the Mate 9 is good for two full days easily. With lighter usage, you could eke out three. I think I've gone the better part of a week without plugging this phone into a wall. Just a few minutes plugged in while I'm in the car is enough to keep it going indefinitely. If you have a longer commute, I don't think you'd ever have to charge the Mate 9 overnight. I'm still not overjoyed by Huawei's proprietary fast charging system. Although, I've found that some USB-PD chargers will juice the Mate 9 at a slightly increased rate. It's not as speedy as the stock charger, but still better than a regular plug. The Mate 9 has a large 4,000mAh battery, which certainly helps it last a long time. The 1080p display helps, too. I was a little worried at first that a 5.9-inch 1080p display wouldn't look good enough, but it's an LCD rather than AMOLED. That means it has a full RGB matrix for crisper lines at this density. I'm still impressed with this screen as well. It has great viewing angles and the black levels are incredible for an LCD. The brightness is also almost as good as modern AMOLEDs. The Leica-branded camera on the Mate 9 has proven solid in my long term usage. There are actually two sensors, a 12MP RGB and 20MP monochrome. They combine to produce very crisp, vibrant images in most lighting conditions. It's not as good as the Pixel or GS7, mostly because of hit or miss low light performance. I really, really like the 2x optical zoom, though. Well, it's sort of optical. The device basically fakes zoom with a 12MP cropped image that doesn't lose detail. The result is the same, and I use it constantly. My biggest gripe is that HDR mode has to be manually activated, and that disables a lot of the camera's other nifty features. Here are a few pictures I've taken with the Mate 9 since the original review. Previous Next Software and Alexa The Mate 9 launched with Android 7.0 Nougat, for which I applaud Huawei. This phone dropped only a few months after the Pixel, so it was nice to have Nougat. However, it has not advanced to Android 7.1, nor has Huawei fixed the few niggling issues I have with its new EMUI 5.0 skin. Most notable among those is the lock screen, which is nearly useless. It only shows notifications once, then they won't appear again despite still being in the notification shade when the phone is unlocked. Ongoing notifications for playback controls aren't shown at all. Even the rotating background image feature of the lock screen is hit or miss; sometimes it just stops working. On the plus side, the home screen defaults to having an app drawer, if you want to use the stock one. There's nothing special about it, so installing a third-party alternative is probably advisable. I don't dislike Huawei's home screen, but this is what I ended up doing. The notifications look a bit strange with the rounded corners, but they work in the standard Android way with bundles and even quick reply. Google pushed Assistant to the Mate 9 a while back, so you can long-press the home button or say "OK Google" to pull it up. Assistant works the same on this phone as it does on the Pixel and other Marshmallow and Nougat phones. You can plug in services like Hue, IFTTT, and more. Alexa on the Mate 9 has some of the same headlining features, and in some ways it seems like it should be superior to Assistant. After all, Amazon has a ton of Alexa skills. The implementation, though, is disappointing. After installing the update, the Mate 9 has a new app called Huawei Alexa. Simply open and connect to your Amazon account to get started. The first thing you'll notice is Alexa doesn't respond to hotwords unless the app is actually open. When it is, you can say "Alexa" to begin a command. Leave the app, and Alexa stops working. For needing a firmware update to roll this feature out, it sure doesn't seem very tightly integrated. The mere fact that you always have to launch the Alexa app to issue commands makes this only marginally useful. There's a shortcut to open the app, which is tied into Huawei's "motion control" features. These are buried in the Smart Assistance settings under "Draw." Basically, you can use your knuckle to tap on the screen (you really have to smack it) and draw a shape to launch apps. Alexa suggests you draw an "e" to launch it, which is indeed the default in motion control. However, this is off by default, which seems like an oversight. Even when you turn it on, this feature is pretty awkward. It fails to trigger sometimes, and the character recognition isn't the best. Using Alexa is rather hit and miss. It works with all the same skills as other Alexa devices, so you can use the web or Amazon's Alexa control app to add new ones. Then, simply tell the Huawei Alexa app you want to "talk to [skill]." However, there are some basic features that are simply missing. If you tell Alexa to play a song, it replies, "Amazon Music is not supported on this device." It says this whether or not you have the Amazon music app installed. Yikes. You couldn't build some sort of bridge between Alexa and the media apps on the phone, Huawei? Alarms too won't work in Alexa on the Mate 9. These are two of my most common reasons for interacting with a voice assistant. Again, Alexa was part of a firmware update, but it doesn't seem very integrated. I will say that Alexa seems to understand my commands very well. After some adjustment to how it wants things phrased, it's able to answer some of the same queries as Assistant, and it has a lot more smart home functionality. Although, I'm annoyed I have to open the separate Alexa control app to get even basic details of my chat with Alexa. At least Assistant shows you the text of your current interaction. Conclusion The Mate 9 is still officially selling for $600, but you can get it a little cheaper if you look around. I'm not going to tell you this is the best phone on the planet, but it's a very good one. I like to gauge a phone's staying power by how often I use it after the initial review is done. A phone that I never voluntarily put in my pocket is not something I would tell people to buy. The Mate 9 is still something I drop my SIM card in on a regular basis for no other reason than I like it. The build quality is great, and I love the giant screen. It's about the same size as the Pixel XL, but with much more screen real estate. I don't know if you can expect more improvements in the Mate 9's software going forward, but EMUI 5.0 is good enough as it is. If you were anxious to get Alexa on this phone, I'm afraid that's going to be a bit of a bummer. It's missing a lot of features and Assistant is undeniably better on Android. The lack of a wake up word is a huge missed opportunity. You should only bother with Alexa if there's a specific platform that it can talk to that Assistant cannot. If you want a high-end phone and happen to find the Mate 9 on sale, absolutely pick one up. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Tags alexa huawei mate 9 Reviews subscribe ...

Anon I though all Nexus devices had their RMA dealt with Google? At least that's what I did for my n5 el_smurfo Only if you bought from them. Ming William Lee Can't decide between this one and HTC10 (without considering the price)... Any thought? Jumanji! I like the HTC 10, but I think the Mate 9 is better in most categories. Ming William Lee TBH my concern is more on software, as I HATE heavily skinned UI... Jumanji! Then you may not be a fan of the Mate 9 since it feels like it was inspired by iOS. Ming William Lee Coz they hired that guy (however that screen icon in power management still stays the same since android 2.x)... But you know, that's just hard for me to decide between those trade-offs... Jumanji! If you prefer the native, untouched Android experience, then the Mate 9 may not be for you. I've installed the Google Now launcher, but that clearly doesn't fix all of the iOS inspired issues in the Mate 9. Other things that may bother you: it's easy and cheap to buy another QC 3.0 charger, whereas the Huawei Supercharger is still expensive. Jumanji! I have some questions about this review of the Mate 9. I hope that's okay! 1. Android Police conclusion about the Mate 9 display: "The brightness is also almost as good as modern AMOLEDs." The display brightness on the Mate 9 (626 nits) is higher than the Galaxy S7 (351 nits) as well as the Pixel XL (403 nits). Is there another AMOLED phone currently out that is brighter? http://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph10871/Huawei_Mate_9-Display-Max_Brightness.png 2. Android Police conclusion on the Mate 9's CPU: "This device is powered by Huawei's custom Kirin 960 SoC, which is an octa-core chip with four Cortex-A73 cores (the latest from ARM) and four Cortex-A53 cores. Performance in benchmarks is close to the Snapdragon 821, and it feels about as fast as most devices I've used with that chip. The Pixel is still a bit faster, but the Mate 9 is easily as snappy as something like the LG G6." In what benchmarks? The benchmarks I've seen are decidedly split depending on the type of benchmark you throw at it. Integer scores are higher for the 960 vs the 820 and 821 whereas in floating point, the 960 loses. Day to day usage for someone like myself (eg: not a mobile gamer nor doing any 3d rendering) favors integer performance. http://www.anandtech.com/show/11088/hisilicon-kirin-960-performance-and-power/2 Even the storage system on the Mate 9 is mostly faster than the Pixel XL. http://www.anandtech.com/show/10871/the-huawei-mate-9-review/7 At some point, I would love if Android Police would invest the time and effort into putting together quantitative tests rather than using somewhat anecdotal qualitative tests. I get that this is not a hardware review site per se, but that I often find information in device reviews here is flat out incorrect which is a bit disheartening since this is one of my favorite Android sites. Ming William Lee I was having exactly the same while reading, just felt the writing isn't so precise. About the screen one, I guess they're comparing with the AMOLED device with auto brightness enabled and triggered by strong light, where the brightness boost up significantly (only for limited time due to the lifespan of diodes). So this is arguably true. The SOC one, I would say it isn't precise to make that conclusion either, as even with the same SOC, the cluster could be very different (that's why even with the same SOC mate series always got a better performance than P series) due to the battery size and body size (for thermal). However, it depends on what do you do with the phone... (but I do see many people saying Kirin SOCs are much weaker than SD which is hardly true now. But I agree with you the difference bench mark could tell is marginal, SD's CPU part always score way behind Exynos but it hardly tells the experience) Jumanji! Valid point regarding display brightness. Automatic vs manual peak brightness wasn't alluded to in the article above. Getting past synthetic benchmarks, what users will perceive, though, is when the UI on the Mate 9 starts to dip below 60fps, which does happen and has yet to be addressed by Huawei. Ming William Lee When Kirin 960 first released last year, it claimed to have 20% better GPU performance than SD821, but on the Mate 9 it never showed up as on the developer board... A reason I would suggest is actually the power efficiency of the Kirin 960's GPU is much worse than SD821 (through varies of test), to make it as powerful as Adreno is definitely possible, but will need to trade with thermo (consistency) and power management, as the device is not designed for gamers (rounded excuse for things never done perfectly...). RyanWhitwam 1) That chart assumes you manually push the brightness slider all the way up. Samsung's phones don't run at peak brightness when you do that, which is by design. They only ramp all the way up to peak brightness in auto mode. The Pixel might be similar in that respect; I don't recall. The GS7 is capable of over 800 nits. 2) Referring specifically to the benchmarks in my original review, which is linked up top. I make no claims we nerd out about benches as much as some sites. It's just not our thing. I'm just pointing out the benchmarks are in the same neighborhood, not that benchmarks tell you all that much about real world usability. Notpoliticalyet I have had the Mate 9 for two months now. Not much to complain about. An all around solid modern device for the time being. Neil Gilroy For me the lock screen renders the device basically unusable and I sold mine as a result. Apps like PocketCasts are unusable (if you ever adjust playback via lock screen) and dismissing notifications in general after being shown once is a total joke if you like to triage your notifications at your own pace. I really don't think these fundamental issues get enough attention - this device doesn't behave like other android devices. And not in a good way. RRH My view here - Huawei Mate 9 is the worst phone I've ever owned. This is unfortunate, becasue I really wanted to like it. The build design is super slick, and the massive screen really stands out. However, the build quality is terrible. In particular, I've seen a lot of people (including myself) with issues around the exterior buttons, which seem prone to sticking. Also, there's no way to get a Huawei Mate 9 repaired or serviced in the USA - trust me, I've tried for weeks. The battery life is considerably less than on my Samsung devices, I get only 8-10hours off a full charge (even with power management), and good luck finding a charge station when you're out - no one really carries USB-C charging pins. My biggest complain is Hauwei's proprietary software - sync programme is intrusive and super-buggy (running alongside windows 10 home). The firmware and UI are both heavy and cumberson. Hauwei simply hasn't done a good job with this device. I should have waited a couple of months for more real user reviews, rather than the fake/paid for professional reviews found on many websites!! Rakesh "The minute White border around the 5.9-inch 1080, 373 PPI display is barely noticeable" On the pictures, it is more than barely noticeable though :-) Robin I think he only means the bezels on the sides and not the top or bottom one. But overall your correct Rakesh He he he Random! Let's be honest: you like the fact that performance ain't shoddy, but you love it mostly for the huge screen. 5.9" is definitely distinct, even if at a measly 1080p.

( Source: Bloomberg) Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing just raised more than $5.5 billion, giving Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick one more thing to worry about. Didi’s record funding round is said to value the company at more than $50 billion and gives it a war chest to ramp up efforts to harness artificial intelligence, build driverless cars, and compete more aggressively in foreign markets. The cash infusion coincides with a rough period for Uber, which is facing lawsuits and an image problem, and follows a detente in China after Uber agreed to essentially cede the market to Didi in exchange for a significant stake. Also Read:  China’s Didi raises over $5.5 billion in record tech funding “The bruising battle with Uber taught [Didi] a lot,” said William Bao Bean, a Shanghai-based partner at venture capital fund SOSV. “Now it’s battle-hardened, and can buy the best talent in the world to attempt to go big in China, and also go global.” While Didi confronts many of the same challenges bedeviling Uber-both are bleeding money and battling regulators-investors are still betting both will eventually have fleets of driverless vehicles in cities around the world. It’s a daring vision, but perhaps too good a dream to pass up. “The biggest risk any investor faces isn’t losing money,” says Andy Mok, managing director at Red Pagoda Resources, an executive search firm in Beijing, “but missing out on the next Apple or Google.” For Didi and Uber, which offer appealing visions of a future when driverless vehicles shuttle people around cities using artificial intelligence, the technology represents a massive opportunity because of its ability to reduce costs, said Kai-Fu Lee, one of China’s most prominent venture capital investors. “Profitability is heavily dependent on the success of autonomous vehicles,” said Lee, a veteran of both Microsoft Corp. and Google. “If you look at the breakdown of the costs of either Uber or Didi, a very large part of the cost – about two thirds – is based on their drivers, on what they pay for drivers, insurance, driver acquisition.”Didi has powerful supporters of its vision, including SoftBank Group Corp., whose founder Masayoshi Son is famous for making big bets. Almost 20 years ago he backed a small Chinese e-commerce outfit that would become Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and deliver a profit of more than $80 billion. The Didi-Uber relationship is complicated – Uber owns about 17.5 percent of Didi, making it the largest shareholder, and also allowing it to benefit from Didi’s success. ( Image for representation, Source: Reuters) “SoftBank is known for making pretty risky investments — like in Alibaba and Yahoo. Sometimes they pay off very big, sometimes they don’t,” said Duncan Clark, founder and chairman at advisory firm BDA China and author of “Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built.” “Son tolerates very high levels of risk.” The Didi-Uber relationship is complicated – Uber owns about 17.5 percent of Didi, making it the largest shareholder, and also allowing it to benefit from Didi’s success. But even if they no longer vie with each other in China, they both have ambitions to be big, global players and are poised to clash in other markets. Didi has expanded outside its home turf mostly by making investments or forming partnerships with ride-hailing companies such as Grab in Singapore, Ola in India and Lyft Inc. in the US For Uber, which is present on every populated continent, India represents its largest overseas market and a pivotal battleground.As Didi develops its autonomous driving technology, it could have the capacity to knit together a far-flung global network of allies, focused on developing markets in Asia and the Middle East, Bao Bean said. While both companies have had a meteoric rise, the men in charge of Didi and Uber are very different. Also Read: How a Chinese cab service uses AI to purge the surge Didi CEO Cheng Wei appears reticent and cautious in public, especially compared with Uber’s Kalanick, who has run head first into numerous controversies. In recent months, Kalanick has seen an exodus of top executives as the company investigates claims of sexual harassment, is facing a lawsuit over self-driving car technology from Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and was videotaped arguing with a driver over fee structure. Didi Chuxing is a four-and-half-year-old app, which is used to hail more than 20 million rides daily in Chinese cities. Its home is a country where car ownership has only recently started to surge – with roughly 800 million urban residents, but only 200 million personal vehicles – and many fast-growing cities still lack efficient subway or bus systems. The pent-up demand for periodic chauffeur-service ensured rapid early growth. The company was formed through the merger of two Chinese ride-hailing platforms backed by Alibaba and fellow giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Didi last year reached a truce with Uber after both burnt through billions of dollars in a fight for market share. The Chinese company bought out its rival’s business in the country, and then basically shut it down. Also Read: Uber self-driving car executive steps aside during Google lawsuit That doesn’t mean the immediate road ahead is easy. Having secured a near-monopoly in China, Didi is still losing money – even after reducing the subsidies offered to drivers and passengers. The higher prices don’t help with customer satisfaction, either. Local governments have stepped in to curtail who can drive for ride-hailing services. Beijing and Shanghai only allow those with local resident permits to be Didi drivers and the cities also specify what kinds of vehicles can be used. “A lot of cars are off the map. Nowadays it’s much harder to use Didi. I have to wait quite a long time, and I use the service much less than before,” said Ma Tianjie, a blogger in Beijing. “I think public perception has soured a bit toward the company; there’s less sympathy compared to when it was just getting started and still battling Uber.” For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Didi Chuxing Uber No Comments.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Facebook tests new “Security Check” tool to fend off account hijacking 29 May 2015 7 Data loss, Facebook, Privacy, Security threats, Social networks Post navigation Previous: Yahoo to face class action lawsuit over email spying claims Next: 20 students charged in school sexting scandal by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Ever worried that someone else might access your Facebook account? Facebook helps with this – as well as Google, PayPal and plenty of other platforms, Facebook can send alerts any time there’s a new login, and there are various versions of device management that will list all the devices that have accessed your account. But how many users skip by these tools, if they even know they exist? On Wednesday, Facebook released a new feature that takes its security tools and puts them directly in front of users’ faces, so skipping them or being oblivious to the tools is all that much harder. The new tool, which is just a test at this point and has only been rolled out to some users, is called Security Checkup, as Facebook said in its official post. Those who see the test appear on their News Feed will be able to change their passwords, turn on login alerts, and clean up login sessions simply by clicking through the screen prompts. The Security Checkup will appear over the top of Facebook’s site and will prompt users to explore various options to increase their security. Then, Facebook will walk users through password security options and show the various gadgets that are logged into different Facebook services. That should make it pretty easy to spot somebody who’s logging onto your Facebook services without your say-so. None of these security options are new, mind you. The tools are available to all Facebook users, but Security Checkup’s purpose is to make them much harder to miss. Depending on feedback, Facebook is hoping to make the new feature available more broadly and whenever users want to access it. It might be just a slight tweak, but – much like the privacy dinosaur – anything that gets security options out of the dark backrooms of drop-down menus and into the light of day, right under our noses, sounds like a good move! If Facebook’s selected you to test the new feature, please do let us know what you think of it in the comments section below.

According to a report by cbronline.com, the AI system, which was trained using almost 5,000 hours of TV footage from the BBC, contained a total of 118,000 sentences from the videos. The key contributions include a “Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell” (WLAS), a network that learns to transcribe videos of mouth motion to characters. In an article published by arix.org, the goal of the work was to recognize phrases and sentences uttered by a talking face, with or without the audio. DeepMind stated that unlike previous works that have focused on recognizing a limited number of words or phrases, they tackle lip reading as an open-world problem – unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos. The same media report added that the AI was trained on shows which aired during the period between January 2010 and December 2015, and later tested its performance on programs between March and September of this year. The lip reader was only able to decipher less than one-quarter of the spoken words, whilst the WLAS model was able to decipher half of the spoken words. Based on the report, citing the News Scientist, Ziheng Zhou at the University of Oulu, Finland, said that it was a big step for developing fully automatic lip-reading systems. “Without the huge dataset, it’s very difficult for us to verify new technologies like deep learning,” he added. In its summary, the architecture of the WLAS model surpassed the performance of all previous work on standard lip reading benchmark datasets, and demonstrated that visual information helps to improve speech recognition performance even when audio is used.  Facebook Comments Website Comments mike tyson March 6th, 2017 Reply z1SL9Y Really appreciate you sharing this article.Thanks Again. rasen schneiden March 6th, 2017 Reply A big thank you for your blog article.Really looking forward to read more.

clock menu more-arrow L to R: Denmark West, Lloyd Carney, Pamela Joyner, Robin Washington, Issac Vaughn, Andrea Hoffman Photo: Devlin Shand for Drew Altizer Photography As nationalism rises, Silicon Valley’s black leaders strengthen their resolve The Third Annual Culture Shifting Weekend by Micah Singleton@MicahSingleton Apr 30, 2017, 10:00am EDT share tweet Linkedin “Welcome to the Blacks in Silicon Valley Trump rally,” Andrea Hoffman said to boisterous laughter throughout the room. And with that, the 2017 Culture Shifting Awards Brunch was underway. Last weekend, on a cool Sunday morning at one of the nicest hotels in Silicon Valley overlooking the Santa Cruz mountains, black CEOs, entrepreneurs, engineers, and investors had gathered to network and to celebrate a handful of leaders who had broken down barriers and proven that skin color does not determine to which degree a person can succeed in Silicon Valley. This was the third annual Culture Shifting Awards Brunch, organized by Hoffman, the CEO of Culture Shift Labs. Hoffman has been at the forefront of the push for diversity and inclusion for nearly 20 years, and has built a network of black executives and entrepreneurs paralleled by few. Back in 2015, I attended the inaugural event, which saw about 200 attendees and included a think tank the day before the brunch, with another 300 people on the waiting list. Two years later, Culture Shifting Weekend has added a third day, moved to a bigger venue, and had over 300 black leaders attending the brunch, with 800 people on the waiting list. Hoffman told me she had two main goals when she created Culture Shifting Weekend back in 2015. “To raise the profile of the vast number of leaders and pioneers of color so that others have a more accurate perspective of what's out there,” Hoffman said. “I think corporations, nonprofits, and their peers lack this perspective. Even the media lacks this perspective.” She also wants to encourage and enable networking and collaboration between people who care about diversity and inclusion by creating an event where the most influential black executives can come and network. “It would not have been possible if it wasn't for the connection that was made at this very event last year.” Deals getting made off the connections built at Culture Shifting Weekends isn’t a new phenomenon either. Laura Weidman Powers, the co-founder and CEO of Code2040, met Alphabet executive David Drummond at the first event two years ago, which ultimately led to a $3 million grant from Google for the nonprofit. “It would not have been possible if it wasn't for the connection that was made at this very event last year,” Powers said on stage last year. According to Hoffman, deals were struck and funding was also secured by entrepreneurs from this year’s event, including commitments made to companies that presented during the Saturday think tank. Nearly every major tech company in Silicon Valley was represented, including Apple, Google, Intel, IBM, SAP, and HP, just to name a few. Even Hollywood was represented, with a Friday discussion about how Black Hollywood and black leaders in the tech industry could work better together that included Cheo Coker, the showrunner for Luke Cage. Future black leaders of Silicon Valley and politics, including Maci Peterson, CEO of Second Thought — only the 14th black woman to raise over $1 million in funding in the Valley — and Michael Blake, the 35-year-old former Obama aide, New York Assemblyman, and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, were introduced to a room full of potential partners that could help them for years to come. L to R: Jose Gordon, Devin Wenig, Aisha Oyebode, Gbenga Oyebode, Damien Hooper Campbell Photo: Devlin Shand for Drew Altizer Photography As you would expect, diversity was the topic du jour of the weekend, with conversations about strategies to help companies improve diversity and become more inclusive being had at every event I attended. But as the world has gotten bleaker over the past year in the midst of a Trump administration, the conversation, justly, shifted to even more serious topics at times throughout the weekend. With the rise of nationalism sweeping the US, Europe, and even Africa, as we learned during the weekend, talks weren’t limited to affecting change in Silicon Valley as they once were, but also about affecting change globally. There was an intimate dinner on Saturday night to discuss tech developments in Nigeria with lawyer, investor, and philanthropist Gbenga Oyebode and his wife, philanthropist and human rights activist Aisha Oyebode, one of the most prominent couples in Nigeria. Executives and partners from Apple, Intel, and Ernst & Young were in attendance. Aisha Oyebode, a co-convener of the #BringBackOurGirls movement, spoke about the ongoing struggle to find and return the 276 girls that were kidnapped from a school in Northern Nigeria by Boko Haram back in 2014 (57 girls have escaped so far). Mr. Oyebode spoke about the numerous startups and business opportunities in Nigeria — which will surpass the US to become the third largest country in the world by 2050 — and explained how the wave of nationalism that has swept the US and Europe is also rearing its head in Africa. Photo: Culture Shift Labs The actor and activist Hill Harper, who hosted the brunch, told a story about sitting next to the Oyebodes and striking his own potential deal. Harper learned that Nigeria can produce the oil he uses in his skin care line, turning that conversation into a potential partnership that could bring jobs to the people directly affected by Boko Haram’s kidnappings. “We need you to allow your genius to shine.” “We started talking about northern Nigeria and the fact that there’re Baobab trees in northern Nigeria. And then we started talking more about the fact that Aisha is doing great work in northern Nigeria, with women in particular, and we also know [about] Boko Haram and the 276 girls that were kidnapped in northern Nigeria,” Hill continued. “And then she said that most of the women in northern Nigeria are the folks working in agriculture, and we talked about the idea of cultivating Baobab trees for my products out of Africa. So one, we can provide jobs; two, we can hit populations that are extremely vulnerable; three, we can figure out a way to connect an American business here — my business — to something going on there, and we have like a triple, quadruple net victory out of a simple conversation at a dinner. “We’re going to create that type of action. We want more of that and we need that, because we need you to allow your genius to shine.” While the problems of the world will make it tougher to create diverse workplaces in the short term, the enthusiasm shown for creating more opportunities and a better working environment for people of color was not diminished in the least from what I saw at the inaugural event. Two years ago, the problems discussed seemed surmountable with time and effort from all parties involved. Now, the issues are more complex, involving far more than unmotivated companies resisting change, but at least for the 300 attendees, their resolve hasn’t changed.

But, unfortunately, it’s sticking to an old formula. Just like Nexus devices of years past, there is a two-year cycle for the Pixel and Pixel XL to get operating system updates from Google. This means, users won’t be getting Android Q when that comes out in October 2019. What you would get is an additional year of security updates but that ends there. Google had the chance to keep users loyal to Pixel and give them a reward for sticking to the device but it seems they’ve missed the chance on this one.

Dr Tunji Olaopa, the Executive Vice Chairman, ISGPP said this in a statement in Ibadan on Sunday. He said that the partnership would commence with an international conference with the theme; “Strengthening Internet Policy through Theoretically Grounded Research’’, According to him, the three-day round table conference will hold at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan on May 2. “The three-day round table will examine the appropriate ways Africa should participate in the internet revolution with implication for economic diversification. “The round table will also examine access to technological infrastructure and finance, content, privacy and security as well as knowledge and capacity building.’’ The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the conference is expected to come up with resolutions for implementation and action. Topics to be discussed include economic diversification (innovation, entrepreneurship and start-ups) with focus on disruptive and emerging technologies; access (infrastructure and finance). Other topics are; content (intellectual property/piracy intermediaries and copyright); privacy and security (safety and rights) as well as knowledge and capacity building. Olaopa said that the collaborative conference would set the tone for a Pan-African academic agenda for internet policy and governance. The ISGPP executive vice chairman stated that the conference was aimed at providing a platform to address the research, publishing, teaching and policy development needs of Africa in the area of internet policy and governance. He said that outcome of the conference would enhance Africa’s contributions in the global internet policy and governance discourse. “The roundtable will bring together various researchers of African descent working in Africa and the Diaspora to identify and critically interrogate core issues about internet policy and governance in Africa. “African academics and experts who understand the unique context and challenges of internet governance in Africa will spend quality time exploring and highlighting specific sub-regional issues from a broad-based conceptual approach,” he said. Olaopa said that the envisaged outcomes of the collaboration would give birth to a Pan-African think-tank on internet policy. He stated that it would also serve as a platform for expanding frontiers in academic research and in advancing digital industrialisation by Africans for Africans. NAN reports that ISGPP is a fast growing research – driven organisation, with a think-tank known as the Public Policy Group (PPG) at the core of its operations. The PPG is dedicated to research and consultancy in support of governance and policy work in Nigeria and the rest of Africa. The school’s research activities are widespread covering all sectors ranging from economy, education, government, climate, environment to sustainable development and international affairs. ISGPP provides to its partners and stakeholders nationally and globally an innovative platform for collaborative engagements on issues of governance, democracy and development.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com When Cars Fly? Uber Wants To Test On-Demand Air Transport by 2020 By Sam Levin PUBLISHED: APRIL 30 2017 Uber said it plans to test flying cars by 2020, with the goal of eventually enabling customers to "push a button and get a high-speed flight in and around cities." The embattled ride-sharing company, which is facing a high-stakes intellectual property lawsuit over its self-driving car technology, said it is partnering with aircraft manufacturers to develop an "on-demand" network of "vertical take-off and landing vehicles." The announcement at the company's inaugural Elevate Summit in Dallas on Tuesday marks Uber's latest push to transform urban transportation, following numerous controversial programs that have led to high-profile conflicts with governments across the globe. Many questions remain about how flying cars will work and how cities will regulate the technology and on-demand systems. The San Francisco-based company has a long history of openly flouting regulations and defying existing laws that control the taxi industry and govern the testing of autonomous vehicles. Uber's first partner cities for the Elevate project are Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Dubai. In Texas, local officials have pledged to make the metro area the first in the US to explore a pilot project for this kind of technology. In the United Arab Emirates, Uber has launched a partnership with the Dubai Road and Transport Authority, which is funding studies on pricing and demand in the region. Uber aims to demo its technology at a 2020 World Expo that Dubai is hosting. The company said it also plans to work with real estate companies to "identify sites and construct vertiports" for what it's calling the Uber Elevate Network. The company said it is also partnering with aircraft manufacturers that are developing electric vertical take-off and landing cars. The summit comes at a time when Uber is facing a high-stakes lawsuit from Google's self-driving car project, with a case that could pose an existential threat to the company. Uber is accused of brazenly stealing vital trade secrets from Waymo, Google's self-driving car entity, and if Google's lawyers are successful in court, the case could block Uber from moving forward with autonomous vehicles. CEO Travis Kalanick, who has suffered a string of scandals in recent months, has said that self-driving cars are critical to Uber's business model in the long term. Uber expressed interest in flying cars last year with a white paper claiming that the technology will help ease congestion in cities. The paper claimed that "on-demand aviation" could "radically improve urban mobility" and shorten people's commutes. Some have raised questions about the noise problems that could come with flying cars in cities, and as part of its summit, Uber has scheduled a session on the subject. There are also questions about how cities and other government entities will regulate the testing and implementation of the technology and how the cars could conform to existing certification processes and air traffic control systems. Last year, US regulators gave approval for the testing of the world's first passenger drone capable of autonomously carrying a person. The US Federal Aviation Administration also approved test flights for flying cars in 2015. Jeff Holden, chief product officer at Uber, claimed in a statement that the technology will support "the reduction of congestion and pollution from transportation, giving people their time back, freeing up real estate dedicated to parking and providing access to mobility in all corners of a city." © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Toyota Shows Robotic Leg Brace Next Article > Amazon Sees Echo and Alexa as Its Biggest Opportunity By Jennifer Van Grove PUBLISHED: APRIL 29 2017 Without revealing specifics, Amazon executives Thursday offered the biggest clue yet that Amazon Echo products are kind of a big deal. In a conference call with analysts highlighting its first-quarter results, Amazon specifically called out its voice-based devices, which are powered by an artificial intelligence platform referred to colloquially as "Alexa," as its No. 1 opportunity. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the e-commerce company is "doubling down" on its investment in Amazon Echo products, meaning it plans to spend big to improve the technology and get more Echo units into more homes. "We're very encouraged by the customer response to Echo products," he said. But as for actually making money from them, "that's not our primary issue right now." The statements, coming a day after the launch of Amazon's Echo Look hands-free camera, further confirm that the company has no plans to back off from this nascent business, despite the fact that device sales aren't yet padding the company's profit margins. Though Amazon has never disclosed sales figures, third-party research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that 8.2 million U.S. consumers own the original Echo, the smaller Echo Dot or the portable Echo Tap. On the whole, Amazon reported $35.7 billion in net sales and $724 million in net income for the first three months of 2017, with both results coming in higher than analysts' predictions. In addition to shelling out on Echo development, Amazon also signaled on the conference call that video remains a top area of interest, meaning consumers should expect a continued back-and-forth with Netflix in the content department. In fact, spending on video content and related marketing -- as in inking pricey licensing deals like the one with the NFL for Thursday night games -- was listed second by Olsavsky as he rattled off the company's areas for increased spending. Amazon recently started selling its Prime Video product as a standalone streaming service for $9 per month. Previously, the company had only bundled the digital video perk, which includes access to award-winning original shows, with its annual Prime subscription. This year, Amazon Video is anticipated to reach 85.3 million viewers in the United States -- or nearly 12 percent more than last year -- according to digital analytics firm eMarketer, which assumes that there are 2.5 viewers for every 1 paid subscription. © 2017 San Diego Union-Tribune under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

EZVIZ Mini 360 Plus review: An adorable 360-degree camera, but a little light on features Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/29 12:35pm PDTApr 29, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares59 Camera Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design and setup 5 Video and audio 6 App and features 7 Conclusion Everyone and their mother seems to be making a stationary home security camera these days, but there are also an increasing number of 360-degree cameras. These small motorized units might a preferable option, depending on what you need to keep an eye on. I tested the Yi Dome Camera a few months ago and found it to be overall pretty neat, but perhaps a little gimmicky. Lately, I've been using the EZVIZ Mini 360 Plus, which is very similar to the Yi 360. It's a low-cost camera that can rotate to get a full 360-degree view of the room. The Mini 360 Plus is a touch cheaper than many home security cameras, and the design is cool. However, it lacks some of the features you get with more expensive cameras, and the image quality is just okay. I can forgive some of that because the Mini 360 Plus also happens to be a cute little device. Specs Camera 1080p Field of View 92-degrees Night Vision Infrared Audio Microphone, speaker Power AC only Connectivity 2.4GHz WiFi Local storage Yes Measurements 100x100x90mm, 220g Cloud storage 7-days $5/month, 30-days $10/month The Good Price Only $80 for a 1080p security camera. Design It's a cute little camera. Rotation You can see the entire room, if positioned well. Includes motion tracking, too. Night vision Very bright IR light. Local storage There's a microSD card slot for local video storage without a cloud plan. The Not So Good Video The field of view is only 92-degrees, and images look too compressed Panoramas Despite having a rotating design, you can't capture 360-degree images for general use. Notifications Not enough options. No geofencing, SMS, audio triggers, or email. Rotation again Controls are a bit clunky, and there's no way to have the camera scan around continuously. App Confusing layout and occasional bugs. Plans No free tier, so it's either a subscription or all local storage. Design and setup One of my favorite things about the Mini 360 Plus is the design. It's a small globe about 4-inches across with a flat bottom so it can remain stable on a table or shelf. You can also mount it to the ceiling via an included bracket. The video output can be flipped 180-degrees to compensate, but there's no other rotation option. That means placing it on a wall is not recommended. The housing has a two-tone color scheme—the top half with the lens is black, and the bottom is white. It looks slick. The top half of the camera is the part that rotates to give you a view of the room. The setup process for the camera is one of the quickest I've seen, with only a few weird moments. I'm not overly pleased with the power cable, though. Most cameras have moved to a microUSB cable for power, but the Mini 360 Plus has a rather weird cable. It's a USB-A at the wall adapter end, but the other end is a DC jack. So, you'll have to run a new cable if you're replacing another camera with the Mini 360 Plus. There's also no battery like you'd find in more expensive cameras. Next to the power jack is a microSD card slot, which can be used to record all your video locally. Not all cameras support this, but I certainly appreciate those that do. After powering up, you can install the EZVIZ app and create an account. I'll give EZVIZ points for supporting Google account login. After you have tied your accounts together, you can log into EZVIZ apps and services via Google. That's handy considering the app has a weird habit of logging me out. The only bump in the road during setup is the email code to confirm the account; mine took several minutes to show up. The camera is added by scanning the QR code on the underside, and then you get to choose how you're connecting it to your network. It supports WiFi, but there's also an ethernet port, which is a nice extra you don't see on most home cameras. If you do WiFi (as most people will) you have to hold your phone within 2-inches of the camera, which is pretty weird. That's apparently necessary to push the WiFi credentials over to the camera. Be aware, if you use WiFi this camera only supports 2.4GHz. Video and audio The Mini 360 Plus has both 720p and 1080p video, and interestingly it defaults to 720p mode. Only when you venture into the settings can you change that to full HD. I think, probably, that's because the 1080p mode comes with a major trade-off. The Mini 360 Plus only records and streams at 15 frames per second in 1080p mode. In 720p it can do 30 fps. This camera can pan and rotate all the way around, which is good because you'll need that to see an entire room. The Mini 360 Plus has a rather narrow 92-degree field of view. Even other rotating cameras like the Yi Dome Cam are wider than that. There's very little distortion at the edges of the frame, which is one upshot of the narrow FOV, I guess. The image clarity is okay in 1080p video mode. I've seen better image quality from other cameras, and I'd probably say it's not worth using full HD mode on this camera considering the lower frame rate. It doesn't look considerably clearer—in fact, all the images look rather compressed. I will give the Mini 360 Plus high marks for night vision. It has a brighter IR light than most cameras, and it flips on quickly when the lights go out. The camera's audio quality is similarly just okay. You can speak through the camera using your phone by pressing and holding the intercom button. Voices come through the speaker a bit crackly, but you can understand what's being said. The microphone gets the job done, but it too is crackly and not very loud. App and features The EZVIZ app can handle all the company's cameras, so you can manage the Mini 360 Plus along with the company's more conventional fixed cameras. The main screen shows you all the cameras you have connected to your account. Tapping on them goes to the control interface where you can view the feed larger and see the video history. The app is responsive, but the design is generally confusing. Features are scattered around, and the camera controls are odd. For example, there are two different rows of controls under the feed, one of which is scrollable. There's no rhyme or reason to which buttons are where, and none of them are labeled. The bottom half of the screen provides quick access to the recorded clips and a timeline view. This part of the app actually works quite well.   Despite having a full 360-degree view of the room, you can't just take a 360-degree photo (as far as I can tell). The only place this functionality is supported is in the pan interface. The camera stitches together a panoramic photo, and then you tap on different areas to rotate the camera there. Alternatively, there's a trackpad-like interface for moving the camera. It works alright, but the delay after dragging makes it hard to get the camera pointed where you want. One of my most serious concerns with this device is the relative lack of notification and recording options. There's no geofencing, SMS, or email. The camera saves every video for every movement in its field of view (there is sensitivity adjustment), and you can't use sound as a trigger at all. There is at least a scheduling feature that can disable notifications, although the video is still recorded. Additionally, it can't be set to pan around continuously . The only automatic movement you get is motion tracking, but you might miss something moving in the room with the narrow FOV and no automatic panning. Like all the companies looking to sell you a home security camera, EZVIZ encourages you to sign up for a cloud storage subscription plan. $5 per month gets you 7-days of saved video, and $10 monthly is 30-days of storage. Unfortunately, there's no online storage at all if you don't pay for it. Many camera makers are at least offering a couple of days free, but here you have to rely on the microSD card. Conclusion I can't deny there are issues with the Mini 360 Plus—the image and sound quality are just okay, and the feature set is lacking. However, it has good night vision, attractive design, and a low price. EZVIZ Mini 360 Plus with the Yi Dome Camera At $80, this is one of the cheapest home security cameras available. Plus, it rotates. I just wish the app could take better advantage of the hardware. If you're looking for a budget camera, I think the Yi Dome Camera is a little better. However, you should spend more if you can. The "premium" camera systems have many more features. Tags cameras ezviz Mini 360 Plus security cameras wifi security camera subscribe ...

An anonymous reader quotes the Associated Press:The fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence... At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube... The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. Thursday CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts that responding to the boycott, Google held "thousands and thousands" of conversations with advertisers, and one analyst now estimates reduced ad spending on YouTube and Google could cost the company $300 million this year alone. google youtube advertising ← Related Links → Humans Are Already Harassing Security Robots YouTube Loses Major Advertisers Over Offensive Videos Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos Intel-Powered Broadband Modems Highly Vulnerable To DoS Attack Advertisers Are Still Boycotting YouTube Over Offensive Videos More | Reply Login Advertisers Are Still Boycotting YouTube Over Offensive Videos Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER Search for: 7 things we love about the Samsung Galaxy S8 – and 3 we don’t Are those gorgeous looks hiding a whole host of hidden frustrations? Here’s what we think 30 April 2017 by Stuff Staff Oh hello there, beautiful. The Galaxy S8 has arrived, and has been getting glowing reviews across the board. It’s easily one of the best phones Samsung has ever made – and not just because it hasn’t blown up. So far. But while there are loads of things to love about it and its bigger brother, it isn’t quite perfect. Now that it’s been living in our pocket for a few weeks, here are our favourite aspects of Samsung’s superphone – and a few niggles that we wish Samsung had managed to iron out before launch. THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THE GALAXY S8 ARE… 1) THOSE DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS LOOKS There’s no question about it: the Galaxy S8 is the best looking phone you can buy right now. Possibly the best ever. It’s not just the curved screen edges, or the ultra-skinny top and bottom bezels. Or the odd 18.5:9 aspect ratio that stretches 5.8in (or 6.2in for the Galaxy S8+) into something you can comfortably use in one hand, or the aluminium frame that sandwiches the front and back slabs of glass together, or the glossy finish that looks a million miles away from the plastics and bare metal of previous years. Nope, it’s the combination of all that, with everything coming together to blow away every other phone that’s fighting for a place in your pocket. If you want the best looking smartphone in your hand, you’ve got to get one of these. 2) THE FANTASTIC PHOTO QUALITY Samsung already had one of the best smartphone cameras around with the Galaxy S7, so it didn’t need to make many changes for the S8 in order to keep that record. And indeed it didn’t: the hardware is practically the same as on last year’s model, pairing a 12MP sensor with an f/1.7 aperture lens, optical image stabilisation and dual-pixel autofocus. The big difference this year is multi-frame image processing, which stitches multiple shots together every time you press the shutter button. It then uses some of these shots to sharpen and reduce noise in the one frame that ultimately becomes your photo. The end result? Fantastic photos that keep pace (and in some cases, overtake) the likes of Google’s Pixel and the iPhone 7 Plus. However dim the light levels are. It might not have the dual-camera cleverness you’ll find in a Huawei P10 or LG G6, but that honestly doesn’t matter when your photos look so good to begin with. 3) THE FACT THAT TOUCHWIZ IS LOADS BETTER NOW Look, we admit it: Touchwiz used to be flippin’ awful. Samsung’s custom Android skin crept into every nook and cranny of the operating system, replacing icons, filling your storage with unwanted apps, and seemingly making changes just for the sake of it. I mean why flip the Back and Recents keys? They’re backwards compared to every other Android phone! Rant over. Thankfully, this year’s version of Touchwiz is an absolute joy to use, with minimal changes to Google’s base OS and options to modify just about everything so you can get your phone working exactly how you want it. Don’t want an app drawer? No problem, just turn it off. Hate all those fiddly gestures and motion controls? Ditch ’em. And finally (finally!) you can reverse the Back and Recents keys back to the ‘correct’ way round. Samsung’s even added a few tweaks that we think are actually better than the default Android skin – for instance you can swipe up or down anywhere on the home screen to open your app drawer. It may sound trivial, but it makes opening the app or game you want just that little bit simpler. 4) THE DEX STATION AND ITS ADDED PRODUCTIVITY I’m guessing that only a small minority of people who actually pick up a Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus will be interested in the DeX Station, but honestly, everyone else is missing out. Because this unassuming little gizmo turns your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer. It’s essentially a dock into which you slot your phone; you just supply the screen, keyboard and mouse, and the phone takes care of the rest. All of your apps work as normal, and some are even tweaked for full-screen so they work just like their desktop alternatives. Sure, some are still a little buggy right now, but we reckon Samsung will be working hard to iron out the kinks and encourage more people to give up on their laptop and just carry their phone around instead. The docking station even charges your phone while you’re working, and has a little fan inside for keeping it cool under pressure. Neat. 5) ALL THE EXTRAS THAT MAKE IT A GALAXY When you’re paying big bucks for a flagship phone, you’d expect it to have all the bells and whistles – and the S8 has them all over the place. Old favourites such as microSD card expansion and IP68 water resistance make a return here, so you won’t run out of space for your music, photos and apps, or have to buy a new phone just because you dropped it in the sink. Wireless charging is onboard, too – something that few other top-end phones have right now, because they’re all still using unibody aluminium designs. The S8’s glass back is perfect for cable-free charging, and we love it. 6) THE HUGE AMOUNTS OF POWER IT HAS Whether you pick up a US-spec Galaxy S8, with Qualcomm’s all-powerful Snapdragon 835 CPU inside, or get a Middle East variant with Samsung’s own Exynos 8995 running the show, you’re getting a ridiculously powerful phone. There’s nothing in the Google Play Store that this phone won’t be able to run smoothly, and that includes the most demanding 3D games such as Asphalt 8. You’ll never see any stuttering or lag when jumping between apps, swiping through home screens, or scrolling through Facebook. And that’s with just 4GB of RAM, too. Plenty of other phones have made the switch to 6GB or even 8GB, but Samsung has instead just worked on optimising the memory to get more from less. It really works, and won’t drain your battery excessively either. 7) THE BEST SMARTPHONE SCREEN YET Yeah, yeah – pixel counts aren’t everything. We get it. The Galaxy S8 might have a 2960×1440 resolution, but that’s not the reason we love its gorgeous display. After all, it’s normally running at full HD resolution to save on battery power anyway. No, it’s the AMOLED panel that really blows you away the minute you get one in your hand. It has near-perfect contrast and deep, inky blacks that make movies and games look fantastic. Colours are vibrant, without being unrealistic, and the brightness cranks high enough that you can see the screen perfectly outdoors. This used to be the major failing of AMOLED screens, but Samsung has cracked it. Oh, and let’s not forget HDR support. Netflix and Amazon Prime might not have any content just yet, but when mobile HDR does arrive, you’ll be able to watch your favourite shows with even better clarity. Nothing else comes close – this is the best screen you’ll find on any smartphone. BUT THE WORST THINGS ABOUT THE GAXALY S8 ARE… 1) THE FINGERPRINT SENSOR IS IN A DODGY POSITION Sure, Samsung wants you to use the S8’s whizz-bang iris scanning or facial recognition to unlock your phone, but we’re betting most people will stick to good old fashioned fingerprints. It’s a shame, then, that the fingerprint sensor is so tricky to find. It got shunted to the back of the phone to clear space up front for those super-skinny screen bezels, and now sits slap bang next to the camera module. Apparently, it couldn’t go anywhere else on account of the battery, but the result is that it’s now next-to-impossible to find by touch alone. Expect to get plenty of smudgy fingerprints over your precious camera lens while you get used to it. Got the S8 Plus model? That’s even worse, as it sits really high up the phone and is a stretch to even reach for those of us with normal-sized hands. 2) THE IRIS AND FACIAL SCANNING AREN’T PERFECT The fingerprint sensor placement wouldn’t be a big deal if iris scanning and facial recognition worked perfectly every time, but you’ve got to hold your phone at a specific distance from your face for them to kick into action, and even then the S8 can struggle to pick you up properly. God help you if you wear glasses, too. Sometimes it’ll work perfectly, other times it’ll refuse completely until you pull off your specs. Too many unsuccessful tries and you’d have been better off tapping in your PIN, password or pattern by hand – it’s just quicker. Until the tech works 100% of the time, it’s just not reliable enough to completely replace the onscreen password or fingerprint unlock. Or do what we do: pair your phone to a Bluetooth fitness tracker or smartwatch, and use Smart Unlocking to bypass the lock screen altogether when the phone is in range. 3) BIXBY IS A LITTLE POINTLESS (RIGHT NOW) Samsung made a huge deal out of Bixby, the Galaxy S8’s AI personal assistant. It was supposed to use your camera to identify objects, work with all of Samsung’s own Android apps, and recognise your voice so you didn’t have to tap the screen for multi-stage actions such as changing your wallpaper or sending a message to a particular contact. Only, at launch, barely any of that functionality is actually here. Sure, the camera works, recognising a carton of Ribena and pointing out where you can buy a case of the stuff through Amazon, but the voice control is nowhere to be seen. Bixby Home, meanwhile, is a long list of reminders, shortcuts and plugins, and it isn’t all that handy if you’re already used to using Google Assistant. It kind of makes the dedicated Bixby button below the volume rocker just a little bit pointless. Maybe that’ll change once Bixby arrives properly, but right now, it’s the one feature we don’t think the Galaxy S8 really needs.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Is Mastodon doomed to extinction? There is much hyperventilating over Mastodon, the upstart social network du jour. It’s easy to drop it into the same bucket as all the other presumed Twitter killers moldering in their digital graves, which is exactly what a lot of people are doing. Without even giving it a once-over, they remind their followers of Ello, Plurk, Jaiku and the long list of other social media hopefuls. Let’s not even start picking through the trash heap of Google’s various attempts. I’m not ready to proclaim Mastodon a keeper. Odds are good that in five years, when the next startup hits the scene, the doubters will ask us to remember Ello, Plurk, Jaiku and Mastodon before getting amped up about the New Big Thing. There’s something tugging at the back of my mind, though, insisting that Mastodon might, just maybe, find its place in the constellation of social networks. What (besides a terrible name) is Mastodon? If you want details, you can find them. One of the best offerings is by Qina Liu, digital engagement editor at The Buffalo News. There are other good introductions here, here and here. Or just watch this: [embedded content] Mastodon is a network of social networks that all use the same software created by a German developer named Eugen Rochko. It uses GNU social, a free open-source microblogging server that has been around since 2014. As Wikipedia puts it, “GNU social seeks to provide the potential for open, inter-service and distributed communications between microblogging communities. Enterprises and individuals can install and control their own services and data.” Anybody can set up and run an “instance,” which is Mastodon jargon for a server. The people who join that instance can communicate with one another. They can also communicate with people on other Mastodon instances thanks to federation, in which each Mastodon instance is connected to all the others. (Well, sort of. More on that in a bit.) [RELATED: Join digital expert Shel Holtz for the Big 5 Social Media Boot Camp in New York City.] As Dan York put it, it’s a bit like email. Your email account is on an email server. It could be Gmail or Hotmail or SBC Global or your company’s server or your own (like mine at holtz.com). You can send and receive email with people who have accounts on the same server as yours. You can also communicate with people whose accounts are hosted on other servers. It also reminds me of the old FidoNet, which fueled community messaging back in the old bulletin board system (BBS) days. According to the Big Dummy’s Guide to FidoNet, that platform is a “a loose confederation of bulletin board systems which stretches around the entire world. Each BBS belongs to a local NETWORK. Each Network handles its own operations more or less independently of other networks in the world. Each Network belongs to a larger REGION, and each Region belongs to a ZONE.” You participate locally but get the benefit of what others have posted through their local BBS. Of course, Mastodon isn’t exactly like either email or FidoNet. First, there’s the interface. If you’ve ever used Tweetdeck or Hootsuite, it’ll seem comfortably familiar. One tab is for writing and sending your messages (called “toots,” which have a 500-character limit, allowing you to write a standard paragraph). The next is your “Home” tab, where you’ll see toots by everyone you follow, along with toots that reference you. The home tab also features toots from people who—well, I haven’t yet figured out why they show up. The notifications tab is where you get toots that include your username. The final tab lets you select from a variety of options, including the local timeline (chronological toots from everyone posting to your instance), the federated timeline (the toots from people who are followed by you and other users of your instance), the toots you’ve marked as favorites, your preferences and more. Finding people on other instances is no easy task (yet); to engage with someone on another instance, you must include their account name and their instance (e.g., @SLHoltz@mastodon.social). If all this sounds daunting, that’s one reason so many naysayers have proclaimed Mastodon dead on arrival. The same dismissal was aimed at Twitter back in 2007, though, and those who found value there figured it out. Mastodon has a lot going for it. Rochko created it to limit trolling, avoid blatant commercialism, provide a true chronological timeline and promote privacy. None of that will make it thrive or even keep it alive. That will happen (if it happens) because of the federated model. Federation? Like Star Trek? Yeah, sort of, if you want to think of each instance as a planet with its own sentient race that lives together but communicates and trades with other races on other planets. Quina Liu likens instances to subreddits in that “each [is] moderated by a dedicated team of volunteers and each may have [its] own specific rules, interests, themes or cultures.” Therein lies the potential. Mastodon instances have been created (as a Mashable article notes) for pizza fans, book lovers, people who attend Burning Man, and more. Podcasting’s podfather, Adam Curry, has set one up for people who listen to No Agenda, the popular podcast he co-hosts with John C. Dvorak. (Adam Curry is a hardcore geek.) You could create one account on one instance and use it like Twitter to engage with people on instances everywhere. More compelling, though, is to have accounts on each of the instances that revolve around your specific interests, engaging heavily on the local scene and using the federation for related conversations. The complications of maintaining several identities across the federation could be too much for most people. If Mastodon lasts long enough for late adopters to find a thriving instance populated by like-minded people sharing an interest, I suspect this single instance will be the gateway. A lot of people may hang out in their local instance; others might venture beyond. This could also present an opportunity for organizations—not to hawk their products as they do on Facebook or Twitter, but to create a place for people with relevant interests to hang out. Ford Motor Co. could launch an instance dedicated to Mustang lovers. Dell might create one for cloud engineers. My friend and former podcast co-host Neville Hobson suggested I set up an instance for everyone engaged with the FIR Podcast Network. Maybe I will, if I find the time. We in the communications profession talk endlessly about building real relationships around substantive conversations in online communities. Mastodon’s model provides the foundation to do exactly that—and get it right this time. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a lot. To begin with, most of the instances created so far are run by hobbyists who could lose interest and fail to install updates, fail to enforce the rules, let the whole thing die or uninstall it altogether. Then there’s the Twitter analogy, bringing people who expect to find Better Twitter. Yes, Mastodon addresses a lot of what’s wrong with Twitter, but it’s not really a Twitter clone. Frustrated, those people will give up quickly. Rochko could do a lousy job at improving the interface, leaving only early enthusiasts and failing to attract new users. It might never get easy to find an instance that interests you. Marketers could flood Mastodon, presenting an insurmountable challenge to volunteer moderators and kill it with commercialism. A spike in interest Instances are cropping up everywhere. People are joining instances like crazy. A user count bot on Mastodon.Social—Rochko’s original instance—shows 50,364 accounts, 904 of which joined in the hour before I checked, 2,894 in the prior day and 7,353 in the previous week. Some other instances are experiencing equally impressive growth, but that doesn’t mean squat in terms of a long-term prognosis. I do know I’m enjoying the hell out of it, more than I have enjoyed Facebook or Twitter recently. It has a more organic community vibe to it. If I had to bet real money, I’d bet against Mastodon. I know the chances of an upstart social network’s succeeding are slim. They’re even slimmer when there’s no money behind it, just a bunch of hobbyists, but I hope it becomes something important. It could fill a sorely needed gap in the social networking world. A version of this post first appeared on Shel Holtz’s blog.

The partnership takes off with an international conference on internet policy and governance in Africa, which will hold at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, from Tuesday May 2, 2017. With the theme: Strengthening Internet Policy through Theoretically Grounded Research, the three-day round table will examine the appropriate ways Africa should participate in the internet revolution with implication for economic diversification, access to technological infrastructure and finance, content, privacy and security as well as knowledge and capacity-building. In a statement signed by the Executive Vice Chairman, ISGPP, Dr Tunji Olaopa, at the weekend, the conference, which is being jointly organised by both partners, is a multi-disciplinary research initiative aimed at providing a platform to address the research, publishing, teaching and policy development needs of Africa in the area of internet policy and governance with a view to enhancing African contributions in the global internet policy and governance discourse. The roundtable is a scholarly interdisciplinary initiative that will bring together various researchers of African descent working in Africa and the Diaspora to identify and critically interrogate core issues about internet policy and governance in Africa. The collaboratory conference will also set the tone for a Pan-African academic agenda for internet policy and governance. Over the three days, African academics and experts, who understand the unique context and challenges of internet governance in Africa, will spend quality time exploring and highlighting specific sub-regional issues from a broad-based conceptual approach.

It’s not really going to divert time and resources from tackling the other issues, after all. The debate about whether it’s necessary at all, and whether one prefers the debate, is valid, but I think the financial stakes involved at the top level of the game, for me, means it has to come in. I was on the fence in the early days, but Henry’s handball against Ireland clinched it.” My point about diving was about the outcry it generates, not about whether players should be banned retrospectively - I’d be happy for them to.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.17am EDT 08:17 56 min Eric Bailly has hurt himself pursuing and hacking at Llorente. He’s down, and to compound the woe he’s being comforted by Rooney. If he can’t continue, United will be in real trouble; Darmian and Tuanzebe are potential replacement options. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.15am EDT 08:15 54 min “Do you know if the referee will have seen a video of the penalty incident at half-time or have been otherwise informed of what we all know?” asks Michael Meagher. “It would surely play on his mind for the second half . . .” I think they’re not meant to look; I heard a yarn to the contrary about a goal disallowed earlier this season. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.14am EDT 08:14 52 min Swansea win a free-kick on the right and Sigurdsson arcs in a pearler. Llorente rises first too, between Bailly and Carrick, who between them do just enough to force a skew-whiff header across the face of the box. But United are not defending their box well today, instead relying on rushed clearances and fortuitous ball-bounces to preserve their clean sheet. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.12am EDT 08:12 51 min “Haven’t the SPL had it as part of their disciplinary system for a number of years that players can be banned retrospectively for diving?” asks David Wall. “I remember a Rangers player getting suspended for a couple of games a number of years ago for a particularly blatant, and well publicised case. If they can do it (and the fact that it was a Rangers player in the top division shows how long they’ve had the policy) then why can’t everyone? It needn’t be that difficult or controversial, just like with retrospective bans for other offences now, where only the most obvious examples are penalised.” I don’t have a problem with that. I just don’t think it’s that important, and I also think that there are bigger ills in the game. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.10am EDT 08:10 49 min United should be home! Herrera picks up the ball on the right of the box, steps over a couple of times, and screws a fine low cross for Rooney. The net is gaping, but all he can muster is a shot powered against Martial’s back; what an oversight! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.09am EDT 08:09 49 min United are now configured in a diamond to match Swansea: Carrick at its base, Rooney at its apex, and Herrera and Lingard on either side. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.08am EDT 08:08 48 min “Rashford has clearly taken diving lessons from Fry and Laurie’s worst football coach,” emails Ian Copestake. It was more of a crumple than a dive, I’d say. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.07am EDT 08:07 46 min Naughton fouls Martial, who well and truly looks at him in return. It’s dead scary. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.06am EDT 08:06 46 min With a sense of burning injustice, Swansea kick-off the second half. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.03am EDT 08:03 “What are they waiting for? Bring on visual aids for referees,” emails Joseph Day. I’m against - I just don’t think football is so important that we need to be certain about everything, and I also don’t think that everything is as clear cut as that was. I’d rather the game flowed and we all acted like adults when responding to refereeing errors. Here’s a piece discussing the issue in a bit more detail. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.51am EDT 07:51 Half-time: Manchester United 1-0 Swansea City What an absolute sickener for Swansea. They’ve played really well, and though United’s pace up front has troubled them here and there, they now find themselves trailing thanks to a refereeing error. We’ll see how they respond in 15. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.50am EDT 07:50 GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Swansea City (45+3) Rooney punches low to his right, Fabianski flings low to his right, and the ball nestles in the bottom corner.

Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA Updated at 8.14am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.49am EDT 07:49 46 min PENALTY TO UNITED! Brilliant from Lingard, who slots a lovely pass into the box for Rashford, who nicks the ball away from Fabianski and collapses. There’s no contact, none whatsoever, but after a while the ref points to the spot. What on earth was he contemplating? Anyway, it’s Rooney with it, which presumably means everyone else has bottled the job. Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford goes down after tripping over a blade of grass. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA Swansea City keeper Lukasz Fabianski tells referee Neil Swarbrick that he didn’t touch Rashford. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 8.05am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.47am EDT 07:47 45 min Rashford drives at the Swansea defence, waits for Martial and slides him a pass into stride. But Mawson does excellently to smother his cut-back, giving United another corner from which they contrive nothing. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.46am EDT 07:46 43 min United do have the players to match Swansea’s formation, and might also do well with Lingard up front alongside Rashford. Talking of whom, he continues his ascent into fury by overrunning the ball on the right, sliding hard into Ayew, and earning a yellow card. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.44am EDT 07:44 42 min Lingard’s had enough of doing nothing on the right, so turns up at inside-left and cuts inside, wiping his boot across a shot that flies wide of the far post. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.43am EDT 07:43 40 min Lovely from Swansea, working the ball beautifully from centre to left, lovely skill from Sigurdsson finding Carroll who takes the return on the left wing. He then clips a pass that Carroll, bursting into the box, should take in stride but can’t, and United have a breaking opportunity. So they pause, wait, consider, ponder, and the chance goes. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.41am EDT 07:41 39 min Glenn Hoddle points out that United have twigged that it’s their full-backs who have time and space. The thing is, they’re still outnumbered by four to three in midfield diamond, so need fast switches and lost of movement to take advantage of a system that can sometimes leave too many men ahead of the ball. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.38am EDT 07:38 37 min For all Swansea’s superiority, the best chance of the half so far was Martial’s. De Gea has made two smart saves, but Llorente and Ayew did well to get shots in at all. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.37am EDT 07:37 35 min Rooney robs Ki, and Mawson does well to help his mate out, at cost of a corner. Rashford takes it - it’s not very good, and hasn’t he got work to do in the corner? Anyhow, it’s easily cleared at the front post. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.35am EDT 07:35 33 min De Gea saves United again! Carroll spreads wide to Ayew as Blind tries to play offside, a couple of stepovers do for Young, and the keeper has to jut out a foot, the rebound only just missing out Sigurdsson. Manchester United’s David De Gea saves from Swansea City’s Jordan Ayew. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters Updated at 7.42am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.33am EDT 07:33 32 min Martial fancies this, rolling his foot over the ball and behind his standing leg to attack Naughton again. But this time the defender keeps his eye on things, bundling through to clear. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.32am EDT 07:32 30 min Carrick appears, first to a loose ball in midfield and sweeping it first-time out to Martial. Martial has Naughton on a croque monsieur, burning inside him, across Ki, and punching a low shot that’s too close to Fabianski, who can’t hold on. But he’s up and onto it before Lingard can poke home. Swansea keeper Lucasz Fabianski reacts quickest and grabs the ball before Jesse Lingard can pounce on it. Photograph: John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images Updated at 7.39am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.29am EDT 07:29 29 min If Swansea had played like this at home to Boro, they’d not be in the bottom-three. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.29am EDT 07:29 27 min Swansea are doing what both Liverpool and Hull did in January: getting around Michael Carrick to prevent him setting the pace of the game and setting United on the attack. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.28am EDT 07:28 26 min Young leaps towards a tackle with Ki but pulls out long before he gets anywhere near. Nonetheless the ref awards a free-kick, right of centre, 25 yards out. Sigurdsson goes for the bottom right, but De Gea reads it well and holds before returning Swansea the ball with a useless throw-out. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.26am EDT 07:26 25 min Martial suddenly steps on it, absolutely rousting Kingsley via nutmeg. And Rooney’s in the middle waiting for the cut-back, but Fernandez does superbly to block. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.25am EDT 07:25 23 min Little bit better from United, Rashford turning up on the right and ducking outside then inside Naughton. The ball then moves over to the other flank, where Young stands up a cross that is still too high when it reaches Rooney at the near post and he flashes a header over the top. Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney heads the ball.

A phone leaker, Evan Blass, last week, put on Twitter that the most awaited version of Android Wear will at last come. The second version of the watch, according to cnet.com report, looks to completely revamp the operating system and help make watches less reliant on phones. Aside from that, the next version will add an on-watch app store and built-in keyboard. As if it isn’t cool enough, the firm will also includes support for both Android Pay (mobile payments) and the Google Assistant, Google’s intelligent voice assistant that debuted on the Pixel smartphone. The report noted that earlier, it was already confirmed that not all Android watches will get the updated version. The original Moto 360 and LG G Watch won’t be upgraded to Android Watch 2.0.

View All 17 Articles In This Series If you think Chrome's rapid updates are annoying, Google's Phone application might send you over the edge. The last 4.0 update came in August, then 5.1 was included with Pixel devices, then another 4.1 update for non-Android 7.0 users, and now we are at 6.0. So what warrants a major version bump? Not much. Google Phone 5.1 actually added most of the UI changes you might notice (check out our post about it). The first noticeable change here is when receiving a call, the notification now has larger Answer and Decline buttons. This is also on the Phone 4.1 APK, but it is worth mentioning here. Another new feature is that Do Not Disturb is automatically enabled when you enter a call. This is useful for ensuring your phone doesn't buzz while on your face. Do Not Disturb mode is now activated when you are on a call. Unfortunately for anyone without a Pixel or Nexus device, the new Phone 6.0 update only works on Android 7.1 or higher. If you are stuck on Android 6.0 or 7.0, you can still use the Phone 5.1 APK from the Pixel system dump.

I was like 'Hmm, I don't remember putting my phone on Do Not Disturb.' I guess it's a good thing.. gar216 It definitely isn't. ddevito Why is it called "Do Not Disturb" rather than what it really is? Which is Mute.. All in all it was obnoxious when the phone vibrates in your ear when notifications came through lol Boolean Corporation Because it does more than just muting the sounds/vibrations. It keeps notifications from popping up in the lock screen and peeking thru apps. They must enable this for Fullscreen apps (namely games) so you get less intrusions. ddevito That's fine, but a true "do not disturb" feature doesn't necessarily mean muted, it simply means I don't want to be bothered by notifications and/or incoming calls - while still having sounds enabled if I want them, like calling "OK Google", or watching TV at home at night, etc - I want to shut that all off while not muting my phone Slepman thats ur version of do not disturb which is a total wrong interpretation. for me and logically speaking do not disturb should not disturb me with sound or notification and mute is just mute the sound. u r thinking about this in pre smartphone era where mute and do not disturb are the same ddevito yeah you're right - all those apps I use to use on my non-smartphones back in the day ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Boolean Corporation If you select any other DND mode than Total Silence, you'll get the ability to play movies and games with sound, with no notifications. Media volume is separated from Notifications volume as well so... Boolean Corporation Alarms Only or Priority Only would do the trick. leganzish So what happens if you receive another call while on a call? I assume it still beeps in the earpiece. Suicide_Note A unicorn appears behind you and gently taps your shoulder. catalysto Bigfoot strolls by and tosses you a burner phone so you can have both your conversations going at once. IcerC I just missed a call because of this I believe. Or I don't hear call waiting... Nicholas Matranga cool, I sent them this tip :) Haider Rehman Butt Thanks! mike shwilly i sent them the material design language Paul_Werner I thought about sending them a sandwich but I ate it Tomfoolery was it made of ice cream? schmaltzy Just the tip? Rohit Mandal Hey, Umm..I am still trying to figure out the significance of this feature. Can you please explain? JSo That's kinda nice. It's been annoying getting a message that makes the phone buzz in my ear when on a call. Although, if you have starred contacts allowed in Do Not Disturbed mode, will those still buzz when on a call? Suicide_Note Good question. Grekin If you notice, it looks like it gets put in Alarms Only mode. At least that's what the picture they posted showed. So no. JSo Yeah, but in the Do Not Disturbed settings, you can allow starred contacts to come through with notifications and calls in Alarms Only Mode. Grekin Not on my phone. I can only do that for Priority Mode. Alarms Only is just what it says it is. JSo Hmm. I may have to check again. I have it automated every night to go into Alarms only mode and I thought I got messages from starred contacts only. Maybe I had it on Priority only before and didn't know. Danny Holyoake The clues in the name! Priority Only only lets through alarms and your chosen (prioritised) apps and contacts. gar216 They don't. It even stops the messages from appearing on your watch. It's is infuriating and impossible to turn off. schmaltzy Agreed. I want to shut this off. I want to see calls when they come in. Jason Pagliaro I miss when my camera would make my notifications silent when recording video. Anybody know if that's back in the new camera? Santos Chavez That's awesome! It's sometimes annoying when I'm getting notifications while on a call. So glad Google fixed this tiny, insignificant to most people, gripe :P Suicide_Note I wasn't bothered by that, but was when i would get notifications while shooting a video. It would be nice if Do Not Disturb kicked in at that time, as well. JSo I didn't notice (or didn't mind) the buzzing on the Nexus 5. But the 5X buzzes like a sonuvabitch. name less This means I No longer need another of my Tasker Profiles then. Asanka Amarasinghe i like a way to turn this off. i had a app installed to vibrate when a call is picked up from other end, so that i don't want to keep watching my screen while someone pickup the call. now that doesn't work... it would work better if the do not disturb turned on after call was answered. Brendan Lazarus I've noticed on the dev preview if I turn on do not disturb for 30 minutes the mode still appears active in the notification tray but has actually stopped after it's scheduled period. Is this just me? Gregor Huc Nexus 5X 7.1.1 Phone version 6.0136097483. Why do I see the old interface (without caller photo) if the display is locked? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd4bbab8c527c8aa04eb92102cbc71c65acb8dffba4742401f9fad233eb69aca.png Bob Likely for privacy Juli G and whats than with google duo??? Gregor Huc And why see Nexus 6P with the same phone version and also 7.1.1 the new interface with only one button with caller photo and swipe up and down gesture F4LL0U7 My god, I thought this was a bug. It would be nice if we could toggle this feature. Or maybe give us the option to disable it when using a Bluetooth headset, headphones, or car hands-free system. I was on calls all morning (on my headset) and it was infuriating that although my phone was sitting on the desk right next to me, I wasn't getting my messages. JSo In my experience with Do Not Disturb, I still get the notifications, it just doesn't make a sound or buzz or flash the led light. I have it set up to start at 10am and end at 6:30am. When I wake up, my notifications are there. It just didn't make sounds or blink the light when they came in. Are you not even getting a notification in your status bar? F4LL0U7 I was getting the notification in the status bar. It just wasn't buzzing like I expected it to. I didn't know DND during calls was a feature, so I was confused and annoyed when I wasn't getting notifications while on a BT call. gar216 I hate androids approach of disabling notifications by default. I want notified at all times. Day or night. That is why I carry a phone with me everywhere I go. JSo Go into the Do Not Disturb settings and turn everything on. Maybe that will override this. F4LL0U7 The thing is, I want DND to work correctly. I put it into Priority Only when I go to sleep or I'm at a movie. And now that they've introduced this new feature, I'd only want DND on during calls using the handset. Hands-free calls (BT headset, headphones, car, etc) should not automatically go into DND mode. Tony Do you lose notifications noises after too? I use DND during work hours and via phone calls, but I don't always get notification noises back. I'll get minor sounds like key presses or unlock, but notifications still seem muted. If it weren't for having a smartwatch that vibrates, I wouldn't know when I get a text or notification. F4LL0U7 I haven't noticed a direct correlation between calls and missing notification sounds. I do notice that sometimes I don't hear the notification sounds, but I get so few phone calls that I don't think they are related. I haven't been able to figure out if I'm just not hearing them, or if they sometimes just don't play. Tony Well I've noticed it much more frequently, because I use bluetooth in my car a lot. Quick fix is to just restart your device, but it's super annoying if you use bluetooth phone calls off/on. First month, Pixels didn't connect to bluetooth cars, which that possibly opened this issue of Do No Disturb auto-enabling and breaking after calls end. wonderfred I've tried turning everything on and it still doesn't help. I want this "feature" something I can turn off permanently. gar216 I have a phone because I want to be notified of things, even if I'm on the phone. One thing that I dislike about Android is that I personally feel that it spends too much time and energy not notifying you of things, by default. My phone is my primary notification device. My job requires me to be reachable at all times. Majeed Hamid I wonder why Google is joining Samsung smartphone software style. Where some features are added to other phone and denied on 1 year old phones. Josh E Just found a possible bug in this. After ending a call it will periodically turn Do not disturb on and off until phone is rebooted. ORCA99 yup it does that to me too. Wasim Yup...this bug has been driving me nuts..after every call DND just sticks and I realize it hours later that I have missed calls and texts. Tony Yes. I've noticed this a few times looking at my watch and seeing DND still enabled. It also majority of the time keeps my notifications muted after calls when DND is disabled. DND is too buggy to be forced upon. Grey When I'm connected to bluetooth I'd like to be able to do my phone call on the phone while outputting music to the bluetooth. yann933 The alarm notification has this new UI as well. Also anyone else notice the little G logo above the VPN key icon in the status bar when you use WiFi Assistant. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bcf3ecaf01890edfa740365577011676db036d848b8c9a42dc29035de667739f.jpg dmo580 This should be an OPTION. If I'm on an hour long conference call I'm also likely on a headset. I'd like to know if I'm getting a bunch of emails, or messages during the call. Parker Reed Agreed. I've even been on calls and when I hang up, the phone leaves do not disturb on and I miss notifications :( gar216 Thank you. This is a step backward. This will literally cause me problem at work on the daily basis, to the point where I will have to switch phones. dogerRodger Finally! I use my phone for business and go nuts when someone sends me rapid fire texts while I'm in a call. Looking forward to testing this out. Azzy ¯_(ツ)_/¯ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/94d92722da3b51926ef8223afcc98c1a287188262588b5c4e59b5b2877479d26.png Rohit Mandal This ain't stock pal! What you on MiUi? Drunk Squirrel No shit Sherlock 😆 And I'm on TouchWiz 😂😂 Soon to get OP3T tho Mark Wheeler Call flash apps do not work in Android 7.1 (Pixel) I had it on my Android 7.0, 6P. teledyn I wish there was a matrix that simply told us what goes and what doesn't and when. For example, in DND we get nothing, not on the phone nor, as with Android 6, by a buzz, but does this mean that a priority call will actually ring aloud and get me ejected from the theatre? Or will it just buzz as before? mtheis1987 It seems that this "Auto DnD" feature is buggy when you use a headset. If you pick up the call with the headset it goes to dnd, thats ok, but if you end the call with a button on the headset it stays in dnd, thats not ok. I missed several calls because "Auto DnD" didnt turn off. srikanthreddys While using Bluetooth and Android wear, Every time I attend the call, the phone is getting into permanent do not disturb mode where we have to change it manually. Looks to be a bug. Tony This should not be set as default. First off, Do Not Disturb has been breaking the sound on my phones for years now. Stemming from the Note 5 to now the Pixel XL. So it's super annoying to get Do Not Disturb automatically during every single phone call. This should be a setting that users can toggle on/off. Either notifications magically work again or I reboot my phone. This is not cool. Adrian Rapcencu So, anyone found any way to turn off this annoying feature. It always remains stuck in Dnd while on Bluetooth headset. This pisses me off. @google: wtf? Turn this "feature" off TedKidd No longer allows text response to 2nd callers? Anyone else find Google feature removals annoying? Sherry Levine This is a bad feature. It turns on the DND but then doesn't turn it off so I am missing phone calls! Also if someone is trying to get in touch with me while on a call, I miss that too. I can't tell if someone is trying to call in. Not good at all Syaoran How is that a useful feature when it can't be toggled to automatically be off? The way this feature is implemented should get some fired! Hopefully no one ever misses a call that is really important over this feature. If they do, expect someone to sue the hell out of Google for this, especially if it relates to an emergency! Michael Tran This is causing my AW watch to go into DND and not come out after the phone call is done.

Google adds the Pixels to its end-of-life support page Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 12:41pm PDTApr 27, 2017 95 Plus 1 on G+ 311 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares479 Android OS Google News Pixel Pixel XL Update 1: 2017/04/27 8:49pm PDT As it turns out, this is not new information. Google simply updated the table on the support page to include the end-of-life for the Pixel/XL security patches, confirming the October 2019 One of the bummers about buying electronic devices is that you know there will be a point after which the manufacturer will no longer keep the software updated. We usually hope for at least two years when talking about smartphones, though some OEMs barely even reach half that time. One of the benefits to buying Google's phones nowadays is that the company now maintains a page where you can see the end-of-life for those devices. El Goog just updated that page and the section for the Pixels — if you own either of those phones, or are still considering buying one, then this is good information to have. As expected, both the Pixel and Pixel XL will be definitely getting Android version updates up to October of 2018. And as for security, Google is committing to October of 2019 for those. At least this shows some level of transparency on Google's part, and it also means that the company is sticking to its earlier two-year version/three-year security updates promise. Update 1: 2017/04/27 8:49pm PDT As it turns out, this is not new information. Google simply updated the table on the support page to include the end-of-life for the Pixel/XL security patches, confirming the October 2019 date that we already knew.

Lovely. EcE Did you expect any different? pfmiller I didn't expect different but I always hope Google will someday realize 2 years is inadequate. Suicide_Note I think it's adequate, but different strokes for different folks. John Doe Is it adequate when you compare the Pixel to Google's main competitor...the iPhone? Timmy Turner Yes because everyone iOS update doesn't provide the same features for those on older hardware. John Doe LoL nice try sidestepping the issue at hand. Timmy Turner I'm not sidestepping anything. I use both platforms and I think the argument that Apple supports hardware with software longer is a bad one. John Doe Updating an operating system is not just for "new features", you give it a new updated UI, fix bugs, security issues, etc. I guess Microsoft updating all windows machines to Windows 10 is a bad argument for you as well? If you don't want to update then that is your choice but the fact that there is no update in the first place is just plain INADEQUATE. Timmy Turner No MS updating all it's machine is good business, obviously. I'm not saying I agree with Google's practice but I do understand it. Desktops and laptops age much better than smartphones, people keep them longer therefore there is a higher incentive for updates to roll out. Also I think the security updates should be a given, but it comes a point where you have to stop updating otherwise we wouldn't buy anything new. It's business. John Doe It's bad business. You don't see Apple updating their older devices hurting their bottom line because they know how to sell products and introduce new hardware features. Timmy Turner If you hate the way Google does business so much, then why not just drop Android and join iPhone users if you're concerned with software updates this much? Also, I do see Apple updating their older devices and screwing up quite a few. When the iPhone 6 got iOS 10 there were users complaining about sluggish the device felt there after. John Doe THAT IS JUST A FUCKEN STUPID ARGUMENT. I like Android and I want it to be better. Also, go check how many posts here on Android police of Google fucking up OTA updates...every company screws up sometimes it does not matter how old the hardware is. Timmy Turner Well first off, it was an argument. It was a question. Good answer by the way. I'm glad you feel so strongly about Android's improvement. I am well aware that Google gets it wrong, a little too often sometimes. My only point here today was that we can't expect Google to support these devices forever. 2-3 is honestly a long time, I don't expect more than that because beyond that there's probably features that will be half-baked on my dated device. The gesture would be appreciated but not something that personally needed. John Doe And I am saying if you are going to create a premium device that competes with Apple then you need to make sure it is as valuable as the iPhone. You need to make sure it is worth the premium price and it has a high resale value (which will be impossible if Google does not support the phone for longer than 3 years) You have your opinion about the issue which is you agree with what Google is doing and I have mine. I don't know who is right or wrong but what I do know is the Pixel devices are not doing so well against the iPhone and they advertised them a lot so there is something missing (probably stock LoL) and Google needs to change some policies. Timmy Turner Lol I have to agree with you there, Google definitely isn't competiting at the level I thought they would when the Pixel line was announced. Suicide_Note Why on Earth would/should Google be at all concerned with a 2 or 3 year old phone's resale value? That's absurd. John Doe If you want to have a "Premium" product then you need to be concerned about resale value. Apple flaunts the iPhone's resale value because it is a sign that people want their devices and "value" them greater than others. Luckbuckets like i said, security updates for atleast 3 years, i would call new UI is a feature, fix bugs i believe also come along with security if there are any worth fixing. Most anyone that really cares about having the latest and greatest software and actual performance updates more often that that anyways so if you want to be on 3 year old hardware and complain, thats your option. John Doe Again, look at Google's competition, Apple. If you can't offer the same value as your competition then don't charge the same amount of money. It is simple economics here. TheSpaceUnicorn Well, the important thing here is that value is subjective. I wish Google would offer software support for longer than 2 years, but it's not something that diminishes the value of their phones, imo. John Doe Yes it does. If your device is supported for a longer time then it will be more valuable than a phone that is supported for a short time LoL Simple Logic here. Go look at the value of iPhones overtime vs Android phones. Try to sell an iPhone 5, S5, Nexus 5 and see which phone kept its value overtime. TheSpaceUnicorn And what if I don't care about resale value, and plan of replacing my phone in 3 years anyway? How does not offering longer than 2 years of OS support diminish the value of the phone to me? John Doe You might not care about resale value but the market does. Not everyone is going to throw their phones in the garbage after they stop using them. WTF? TheSpaceUnicorn Who's just throwing their old phones in the garbage? John Doe Exactly, that is why people care about resale value because whether they decide to sell it, give it away, or keep it...they know that the phone still has value if they didn't they would throw it away. I don't know about you but I don't keep things that don't have a value to me. TheSpaceUnicorn I don't keep things either, but I couldn't possibly care less about resale value. I buy phones to enjoy them while have them, not to turn around and get as much as I can selling it later on. Suicide_Note I throw mine away if i don't feel like putting the forth the effort to sell it. itsjustironic Your logic is flawed and is just conjecture. Outside of tech communities, the average consumer more than likely has little knowledge of their phones supported life. Did you maybe ever think of something called branding? It's why companies pump billions to build their brand. It's why people will pay 10x more for a t-shirt slapped with the Nike logo on it as opposed to the plain tshirt that more than likely came from the same factory. Heck they can even keep a high resale value because they don't know how to depreciate properly. While people may resell it later on, I doubt most people purchase a product and the main factor in purchasing it is how much they can recoup when they sell it later. John Doe Google's brand is as valuable if not better than Apple's. People outside the tech community are not stupid they know when a new OS is launched. "While people may resell it later on, I doubt most people purchase a product and the main factor in purchasing it is how much they can recoup when they sell it later." That is not what I said. It does not matter what you bought the phone for because the market will determine the value of the product you have by its resale value which will tell you if you had a "premium" product or not. This is how you measure the value of a product not by people's opinions or a company's brand but how much is it actually worth to people, how much are people willing to buy it again? Luckbuckets simple economics, if you dont want it, dont buy it. In an ideal world our phones would update for ever but you can't expect that and atleast they are giving you fair warning before you buy. John Doe Actually most of these devices were not given an exact date when they were released. Also, if Google's stance is "If you don't want it, don't buy it" then they have much bigger issues than software updates. MicroNix Agreed but really. The hardware now is matured enough that it can last far past 2 years. Whoever thought 2 years was acceptable for a $700 PC? No one. So why treat your $700 phone any different? I squarely blame the carriers who started conditioning people to get a new phone every 2 years when they had contracts. Now everyone thinks its normal to have to buy one every two years. Marcelove Everyone? Nope.... Only idiots... Or idiot prostitutes that keep giving their money to someone that only want to screw them. Michael Jones And yet it isn't. The iPhone 5 got iOS 10 with all the latest security updates. Yes it is missing some features but those people's most personal devices are still very secure. It even got a massive speed boost for those coming from iOS 9. The amount of insecure Android devices running around due to the update problem is insane. Duder12 Google doesnt have control of the processor like apple does which means no drivers. John Doe Then Google shouldn't be charging what Apple does LoL Kiko Eschobar Exactly lol... Zsolt V I'd rather have a full set of updates for a shorter period of time than a gimped update designed for you to buy the latest color of a 4-year old design. Michael Jones Google has been making devices for a while now. They are also one of the richest companies in the world. If they actually wanted to support these devices for longer they would be trying to put it in their contract with Qualcomm. Money for support goes a long way. Nathan Bryant Have you seen an iPhone 5 run iOS 10? Painful. Michael Jones Still leagues better than it was with iOS 9. Pretty well documented at this point. Timmy Turner I agree about security as far as iOS goes but I know too many people who had to deal with shitty feature updates because they were on older hardware that couldn't handle it. It's no secret that hardware doesn't keep up with software. TheSpaceUnicorn It's not merely an argument, it's a fact that Apple gives their hardware software support for longer than Google. For the most part, the only software features old iPhones don't get are features that require hardware that new iPhones come with. AndroidUser00110001 When Siri was first introduced Apple claimed it wouldn't be available on older hardware but then it has hacked to work on the older hardware... TheSpaceUnicorn I take it you missed the part where I said "for the most part" Zsolt V Let's try to get real. Luckbuckets hey man, if you want google to change it to 5 year and just change the number you see, im sure that might be an option the might entertain. features are a big part of updates and they are covering the phones for security for atleast 3 years. it is what it is Luckbuckets meant to reply to johndoe Timmy Turner Kind of figured lol John Doe The problem is that they are not doing well with software updates/security updates as what their main competitor(Apple) is doing. Luckbuckets they also sell more of those models that google does, if google sold as many pixels as iphone 7's then im sure there would be more concern EcE Add some Android manufacturers on the table, get more negotiating power on your side, sell less phones as the current phones keep getting updated.... oh wait. John Doe LoL that is just a silly argument. Sales have nothing to do with this and if it does then we now know why they aren't selling enough lmao Dmitry Stepanushkin +1. failed. +1 again. now it's +2😀 TheSpaceUnicorn Good thing old iPhones get new features with new iOS updates then, huh? Suicide_Note Yes, it is, because i buy a new phone or two every year, so I'm fine with this. John Doe I guess you are in the minority because more people are buying iPhones than Pixels. I am not saying OS updates are the reason but Apple is obviously doing something right and Google plenty wrong with regards to their "premium devices". Zsolt V Yes, at least you get full set of features for 2-3 years, as opposed to a new version number with a spit-and-polish. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ But you still have to deal with a krApple iPhone. Who wants that other than soccer moms, teeny boppers, "gadget guys" and other the ignorant technophobes who make up the vast majority of iPhoners? Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe you haven't looked at statistics lately, but iPhones are the highest selling mobile devices in the world. So, obviously somebody's buying them... Competitively, how are the Pixel phones doing? 👎🏾 PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ So you believe that something's popularity equates to its inherent higher worth? That's an incredibly juvenile and vapid assumption. Do you also believe that taller beakers always hold more water than shorter ones or that shiny money is always worth more than paper money? :D Knowledgeborn Allah That's not even close to what I said... But yes, if we're being realistic, the iPhone is intrinsically more valuable than the Google Pixel, and every other Android phone for that matter. Why? A lot has to do with hardware and software support. The fact that the Pixel and the iPhone are priced identically, and yet the iPhone (a) holds its resale value for much longer, (b) has a much wider consumer base, and (c) gets supported for much longer by the manufacturer, clearly shows which device has a greater value proposition. Even if we just talk about OEM support for tech devices, that alone puts Apple well ahead of any Android manufacturer. The OnePlus 3T costs around $430 and gets supported for 2 years. That makes the net value for the consumer around $215 per year. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7+ costs around $750 and gets supported for 5 years, making its net value around $150 per year. The iPhone 6s+ still has a general resale value of around $550 or more. Not only is it almost 2 years after since device was released, but that has a higher consumer market resale value than the Google Pixel right now, and that device just came out around 6 months ago! If you honestly think that doesn't say something about its overall value, then what does? Bubba Jones Ah, in my world business users stay with iPhones it is rare to see one with an Android. To make fun of iPhone users calling them ignorant is a sad commentary of yourself. There are plenty of Android users that only know how to make and receive calls, check e-mail, text, that is the extent of their smartphone use. Truly not a bad thing in the least, all it means is that is all they care to know maybe all they need to know. Yes, that include the same demographics you made disparaging remarks of iPhone users. The iPhone may not fit your needs, yet it fits millions upon millions of folks all over this globe. People such as soccer moms, teeny boppers gadget guys, business professionals, military folks, medical practitioners, the legal profession, etc. etc. etc. You are on your high horse, when you step down do be careful where you set foot. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ business users stay with iPhones The only "ignorant" and "sad commentary" here is you believing that "business users" know anything more about technology than the rest of the world. The remainder of your straw man assertions and rebuttals are too tedious to address. Bubba Jones "...The remainder of your straw man assertions and rebuttals are too tedious to address.....", then why did you return a comment? My logical comment must have hit your logic nerve. My reference was not that they know more. Notice that I am stating that the same demographics you disparage for purchasing an iPhone also purchase Android devices. Folks chose the device that best suites them. Also, users migrate between devices as well. Making disparaging comments about folks that chose a device that suites them, but not suites you is a immature thought process. Cellphones are not a religion, political, nor a life and death matter. When someone chooses a device that you do not like do not get your panties in a wad. Their device choice works for them, so be mature thus be happy for them. It is my hope when you are in public, business settings, and with friends and relatives, you do not come across in the same manner about their chosen devices, belittling them and making disparaging remarks as you have here. Instead, in a friendly helpful manner show and explain why Android may better suite them; never ever disparage them. You can do that. EcE ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Borgman I thought it was because Qualcomm stops support for chips after roughly 2 years (for the pixels, 821). So it's not up to Google, but rather QC.

Eclectech well I guess Microsoft wages a little more control over Intel than Google does over Qualcomm. Thomas Larsen Uh no? They're completely unrelated. One platform was mainly used for special embedded products, while the other is made for generic IBM compatible PCs. You still got legacy stuff from the 80's in those bad boys. TheSpaceUnicorn Well, yes, but that's irrelevant because that's not how that works. UtopiaNH Yes, but the primary reason is the architecture of desktop OSes, which have a hardware abstraction layer that mobile OSes do not. This adds overhead that significantly affects the battery life, can cause instability and hardware bricking, and most of all performance of the hardware when the drivers are compiled directly with the OS. Those elements are why no mobile OS is distributed without the primary hardware drivers compiled with the OS, and each of the big three has a different way of handling it. Apple designs their own mobile processors, only supports the limited list of processors and can update the drivers with the OS with no problem. Windows Phone, was distributed with the drivers as part of the OS, which meant microsoft had to wait for Qualcom to release a new processor, then a full release cycle of the OS before support could be added. It meant that every change to hardware, from as basic as a camera, to different button configurations needed to be handled by Windows, rather than the OEMs which slows down iteration of hardware significantly. Google provides the OS uncompiled, and leaves it up to the OEMs to finalize the OS with the drivers needed for each piece of hardware. However, that means both the OEMs, and every single driver provider needs to adjust and test the OS and compile a new update. Since Radios are a major part of all phones, and they affect networks, this adds in an extra layer of the carriers having a say in the devices using those radios, and they can throw a monkey wrench into the process with any device (both windows phone and android suffered this), and the only reason Samsung, Google, and Apple have been able to push OSes without a ton of carrier interference is deals, market power, etc. Windows Phone's advantage of controlling the drivers allowed them to avoid OEM interference, and provide updates, but they couldn't provide them with carrier approval so no OTA updates and had to be downloaded manually, and even still, they end of lifed stuff when Qualcom EOLed them anyway. The only way Google can eliminate this for their own devices is to do what Apple does and design their own processors, and even then they have to still deal with carriers and can end up with stuff like Verizon exclusivity just to be able to distribute their own updates. There are other drivers that can break, but they aren't at the same fundamental level as the SOC is. 4Ui812 Thanks for the detailed explanation 👍 Francois Roy Big OEMs like Google and Samsung could easily negotiate longer support periods from Qualcomm. Support is part of the deals they make. They simply rather keep the money/don't care. Support for 100% Exynos models (Note 2, GS3, GS4) wasn't any longer than the other models at the time. UtopiaNH An OEM actually is disincentivized to provide longer term support since it both costs money, and has low demand from the public perspective, and actually is counterproductive to future sales. Google however is more incentivized due to it not being entirely an OEM, and caring more about the view of the general public for the security of Android, and honestly any deals they make don't fix all the other companies out there still causing issues. Google does not order enough volume from Qualcom to demand or make deals for longer support. In fact part of Google's Nexus team's issues over the years has been fighting over open sourcing the drivers they use for each Nexus device, and Qualcom fought against that pretty damned hard (for example, this is why the Nexus 6 was missing hardware encryption). To me, as an engineering solution it makes more sense to simply make Android more and more modular, so updating the base OS is less and less important and more can be done OTA with no interruption. If they can get Security patches outside the base OS and all system apps outside it, there won't be nearly as much issue or pressure to get any hardware update coordination. Rod Although your post was very informative, I suggest you use more paragraphs. It makes reading way easier. RainMotorsports Android had a HAL. Samsung abstracted the hell out of it's version of Android back in the ice cream sandwich days for exynos hardware. Not sure about any others and or newer versions. They had a major change to the abstraction layer for the radios at one point that locked source built rooms out of using newer modem firmware. destinyhud to put it differently. Intel update their processor more than qualcomm. they are also difference in OS, embedded vs non embedded os 2×4 until google makes their own chip, then they may consider 3+ like Apple Zsolt V Yup, that's what Google should do. Slap a new version number on a gimped update. Dmitry Stepanushkin Are we gonna get another beta testing in hardware? Google better do its job as software company. Suicide_Note Shhh! People don't like facts around these parts when those facts don't support their argument. bekifft Kind of, but Qualcomm will tell you that the OEMs don't support the device longer than two years. And OEMs will tell you Google doesn't support it for more than two years. And Google will tell you Qualcomm doesn't support it for more than two years. And Qualcomm will tell you... someone755 I'm blaming Google. Why in the world would Qualcomm keep supporting hardware when none of their customers are using/supporting it anymore? If Google says "Android phones will live for 2 years", qcom has no incentive to support the devices for any longer. bekifft I tend to agree, Google is the one that can break that cycle, really the only one. Reminds me of Microsoft and Intel back in the day. M. Luciano Google can't break it. Who is Qualcomm going to cater to? Google's 5 million devices per year or Samsung's 50? bekifft You may be right about this actually. But Samsung tried to make their own OS and it didn't work out in phones for them, arguably in anything. Google could change the Android Compatibility Document to apply pressure. I just don't think it's a priority for them, if anything they see it as a good thing, to sell more phones. M. Luciano Google is a tiny OEM. Samsung sells 10x their volume and has been doing so for years. Google is a 9 month old OEM with less than 10 million sales. Qualcomm couldn't give a f less what Google wants for support, at this point. pfmiller I guess you'd be surprised what companies would do for a little extra cash. M. Luciano Which Samsung is giving them, not Google. As soon as Google becomes a major player as an OEM or starts tapping Qualcomm to help with Google's own custom SoC, then Google will have some weight to throw around. someone755 Google is a tiny OEM but a huge company. They dictate how long Android devices should be kept up to date for, because they own Android. M. Luciano "owning" Android doesn't give Google the right to dictate support life-cycles or update schedules to the OEM's. And either way, that doesn't impact Qualcomm. Google only has bargaining power with Qualcomm insofar as their own contract with Qualcomm to supply parts and support for their own devices. Amit_N This is the sole reason why there should not be a monopoly in any market. I really hoped that Intel would succeed which will keep pressure on QC but that hasn't happened yet. Marcelove Yeah, even if Google wanted to change that, it hasn't leverage to do nothing against this scenario right? ? Geoff Johnson Or get mad at Google, who then in turn could require Qualcomm to support it for 3 years instead.... Nathan Bryant The average life of just about any phone is 2 years. Software updates reaching that time and beyond will cripple your device. Phones aren't made to keep working at their best or even at a quality level beyond that. Your performance and battery life will be absolutely​ terrible. iPhones are perfect examples of this. My friend has an iPhone and has stuck with the platform for several years. The newest one is only a pleasurable experience when it first comes out. Going on after a year you start to notice a decline in performance and definitely battery life. Even with their continued updates the device is just crippled. I experienced this with an iPhone before. For all I know it can be a conspiracy as to why phones tap out around that time. I honestly think they're just built to last about that long before needing to purchase a new battery, external battery, or time to upgrade. pfmiller It used to be that upgrading every 2 years made sense since the hardware improvements each year were substantial. That's no longer the case. My N5 still runs quite well. TheSpaceUnicorn I've never felt the experience of an iPhone diminishes so much that getting a new one any sooner than 3 years is worth it. Once you hit the 3 year mark, however, it goes downhill fast. By contrast, most android phones start to feel ancient by the time they turn 2, imo. That said, I have no intention of replacing my Pixel XL until it turns 3, and I won't be missing any major android updates, as I'll just buy the pixel that launches with the first version of android the Pixel XL won't receive (Android Q) Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Its Qualcomms fault. pfmiller I don't really buy that, but even if it's true I don't really care. I'm Google's customer. If Google's suppliers are a problem it's Google's problem to deal with. MisterAlex Eh, they'll realize whatever sales numbers tell them. I didn't want to drop over half a grand on a two-year device; I'll just keep using my Nexus for now. What's the support life on an iOS device? Do those "last" longer? M. Luciano That'll happen as soon as Google starts fabing their own chips. [A]dri[A]n Well Google, Qualcomm and all the OEM's need to sell new products​somehow. Can't do that when you're supporting products for too long. Simple as that. If they just keep on supporting existing devices, people would be more inclined to keep what they already have instead of going out and buying the shiny new stuff. pfmiller If people decide not to buy from them again because Apple has better support that benefits them even less. [A]dri[A]n But that's not gonna happen, so yeah... Haha Android has way too much pull in terms of market share. Marcelove Google already knows that... But people gave happily their butts to the company, so why Google should bother to change the system? ᔕTOᖇᗰ ᔕᑭIᖇIT You hope that from a company who doesn't even know how many messaging apps are 'adequate' to push down our throat. Timmy Turner That's the way it's always been though. Yoann Ferret Well, that's the way it always sucked. Shouldn't they improve that? Sruly J Of course they SHOULD, it's just a matter of if they WILL. EcE There was never any indication it would be improved. John Doe Did you not watch the Pixel announcement? They were bragging about how they control the hardware and software now and it allows them to do things they couldn't before...I guess keeping the phone up to date for longer than 3 years wasn't one LoL EcE Remember how they were bragging about Allo and how awesome it would be? pfmiller This is the first device they put out that they really treated as a "premium" device and a direct competitor to the iPhone. When you hike the price of a product people kind of do expect better support. EcE As I said before and Google is probably saying right now: ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Do I think it's ok? Absolutely not. It matches iPhone's prices, it should match iPhone's support. Watch how long it will take before someone comes and says: "but the Pixel 2 will be the true Google phone, the Pixel never was intended to be a true Google phone". pfmiller It's fine for you to shrug your shoulders, but it's unacceptable to get the same response from Google. They're actually in a position to do something about it. EcE That's the thing though. They have never done anything about it. Take a look at their hardware history, phones, tablets, laptops, OnHub... Again, I don't support this behavior but at this point I don't expect any better from them. Timmy Turner Security wise yes, but OS software wise no. Technology software advances too fast and hardware doesn't age well. Google has to continually improve Android OS as a whole. Just look at how a new software update can crush performance on older iPhones. pfmiller If a phone's hardware is incapable of running the new software that's a legitimate reason to stop upgrading it. Google stops upgrading them well before the hardware is incapable of running the newer versions though. Kiko Eschobar That's assuredly false. The HTC One M7 stopped getting official updates two years ago, but has ROM support up to 7.1.2 with NO hardware performance limitations AT ALL. Google has brainwashed the lot of you into thinking there's compatibility issues when they simply don't feel like putting in the effort software wise. You gonna tell me won't be able to run Android Q without issues? Thomas Larsen Hardware performance != compatibility. Fact of the matter is that Google doesn't have exclusive control over how hardware is supported which does influence officially sanctioned releases. Hackers don't need permission to tinker around. pfmiller Umm, did you actually read what I wrote? Kiko Eschobar Sorry, replied to the wrong guy. I suck at this forum thing... Timmy Turner I agree they do stop support a tad early. For instance I'm sure the Nexus 6 could've easily run the current Nought build yet it's stuck at 7.1.1, sure they have reason. Would be nice to know what it is beyond cost alone for development. Grunty Its almost like it was predictable to everyone but you. Suicide_Note Not sure if you're okay with/upset by this. Hmmm... Corbin Davenport The latter. Duder12 Why dont you guys write about how Qualcomm is fucking this up every year? https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ EcE Now, this is a good idea. I'm sure a certain guy at Ars could do the same. Duder12 Right? If Ars and Android Police did some good research and wrote some big articles on Qualcomm fucking up Android it would be HUGE> bekifft Ron Amadeo did lay this out quite nicely once, but I can't seem to find it. Duder12 Same goes for anyone with a $850 s8+ except much worse. mondeca Samsung doesn't make the OS. Duder12 Youre right but Qualcomm does and they only contribute their drivers for 2 years. cadtek91 Yes they do, well they build it anyway from AOSP. So if Samsung wanted to make an Android O build right now they could. But in two years QC won't be supporting the sd835. Corbin Davenport The Android O Developer Preview isn't in AOSP. Necdet Ali Özdür How is it much worse? Samsung supports it's flagship devices as much as Google does. 2 years of major OS updates and 1 extra year of security patches. It's not good at all, but not much worse either. blenderboy One more thing Google has to do next to be no different than other normal Android manufacturers. Sell the current pixel for half the price when the new pixel comes into market. My expectations of pixel becoming on par with iPhone just went out of the window. They should have at least provide security updates for 5 years. Duder12 Corbin, Read this: https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ james fuston Yes, just like the $94,000 BMW M5 gets the same 4 yr/50,000 mi warranty as a $33,000 BMW 3 series does. You're paying for the hardware, not the support. bekifft But that extra money buys you retail locations with real people, and easy warranty returns, and generally higher quality hardware, and that cool logo on the ba- wait, maybe I'm thinking of someone else... Kevin Davis 😂 lmao. Good one, bud. I was just going to say you went to an Apple Store, until I got to the end of your comment. Marcelove You've accepted be Google's prostitute the day you bought a Dead Pixel... So why are you upset about being fu**ed by the company when you happily gave your ass to it many months ago? My name is…. That why i say pixel is a bad buy Max Johnson Jokes on you to spend $400 for that 5X. Sason Rashidi I'm glad now i didn't get the Pissel Sruly J What about the Pixel? Phil Do you expect to receive updates for longer from any other OEM? Suicide_Note In other words, the Pixels are treated just like Google's other phones. Not sure why anyone expected anything different. I'm fine with this. Dallas King Because it was priced as a flagship? Duder12 Google cant tell Qualcomm what to do. Qualcomm controls the "official" drivers for SOCs . If you didnt notice Qualcomm has a complete monopoly on the SOCs in the US and dictates all terms. When are people going to finally learn this? Sebastian Google can also make reasonable contracts like "I'll buy XX million of your SoC if you support it for at least 4 years." - problem solved. Duder12 Oh is that how it went for you when you did your SOC negotiation with Qualcomm? I didnt realize it was so easy and Qualcomm would be happy to sacrifice future SOC sales that easily. Tell us more. blackice85 Yeah the real fix is for Google to make their own SOC, but as mentioned already that's no simple task. Sebastian Yes, Qualcomm would be sacrificing nearly everything because of the Pixel being the top seller in the Android market... I knew I missed something while writing my first comment... EcE True. But I'm sure they could IF they wanted to. mattcoz Sure they can, they can whip out the checkbook and write down whatever number it takes. Suicide_Note Aaaaaand? i_say_uuhhh I really wished it would be 3 year/4 year security. Duder12 You can thank Qualcomm for this. Santi Ginestet If google had wanted to update the devices 3/4 years, qualcomm would provided the drivers. I'm very sure. Google is so much bigger than qualcomm Duder12 Have you ever heard of small non existent companies suing huge corporations due to patents? Qualcomm has the patents. Qualcomm has the power. Santi Ginestet Motorola too........ But anyway, they are working together Google and Qualcomm right? Duder12 Qualcomm updates their drivers for 2 years and there is no if and or but about it. If they supported longer it would hurt sales for them since that means less handset sales down the road. They control all the radio patents in the US which are bundled with the processor and gpu. Santi Ginestet Ok i saw it: https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ May be you were right... Santi Ginestet Then a new argument is out, what happens with mediatek devices and updates? Duder12 Pixels dont use mediatek because they CANT. Santi Ginestet I KNOW! I WASN'T TALKING about google pixel devices, i was talking about any mediatek device, i'm sure it hasn't got 2 years of updates. Duder12 Than your argument belongs in a different article Xchris That's fine with me. I'll be getting the pixel XL 2 anyway Duder yeah me too Santi Ginestet And i will buy the "old" pixel 1 to people like you! Jajaja marcusmarcus2 Google be like https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnt8Thwuy7Pr8EU/giphy.gif Dallas King "... it also means that the company is sticking to its two-year version/three-year security updates promise." Yeah, we'll see about that. Hopefully, but I'm not holding my breath. Sruly J @corbin_davenport:disqus Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there talk for a while that Google is working on their own processor, and if they do come out with one and use it for future devices, it would enable them to support devices for longer? Duder12 yes and yes but not this year. Sruly J Yeah, probably should have mentioned that, although considering when those reports came out, and how long something like this could take, I figured it was a given not this year. ;) Corbin Davenport There were rumors, but I don't recall if they had any credibility. Duder12 Google has already said on record last fall that the Pixel gives them that opportunity. That tells you they are at least trying to make it happen. 9To5Google reports on this stuff. I dont get why AndroidPolice doesnt seem to know much about this topic. Corbin Davenport Having the opportunity to develop SoCs in-house and actually working towards that are two separate things. Duder12 It was a very promising statement. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-04/behind-the-pixel-google-s-first-real-threat-to-apple-s-iphone Also, read this about qualcomm's lack of SOC support: https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ Sir_Brizz I think Qualcomm is in "turning a tanker" territory at this point. We all know it's mostly their fault. Thomas Larsen Think there were rumours of them hiring some hardware people, but it's not even that simple, getting their own silicon out would be a pretty massive undertaking. Sruly J Of course it's not simple, especially since something like that could (and would) shake things up (and not necessarily for the better). ASense0fPurpose "No[t] guaranteed..." https://i.imgur.com/mUI1Huo.jpg Xavier Don't iOS devices typically see around 5 years support? Android Police should be more aggressive about coaxing Google (and other flagship manufacturers) to do the same instead of just singing the same old mantra all the time. 3 years support is ok if it's a cheap device, but in the same price range as an iPhone that sort of lousy support should steer people away from Android. Mark McCoskey That's the thing I like about Apple. They update all of their devices. Wish there was a way to update any device I own with pure Android. Cakefish *2 years support. David Thoren Then I guess we can't really count Apple's support as 5 years because they don't typically allow the older devices to have all of the newest features. Bob Marley It's usually due to hardware reasons. Cakefish My iPad Air 2 has all the features of iOS 10.3. Only lacks 3D Touch for obvious reasons. Sachin Bahal They sort-of do, but have you used like an iPhone 5 with iOS 9 or 10, you'll notice that it becomes unbearably slow or what iOS users called "iOS slow", this is partly for planned obsolescence, there's no real proof that Apple is doing that on purpose http://globalnews.ca/news/2926170/is-apple-guilty-of-using-planned-obsolescence-to-force-iphone-users-into-upgrading/ Sir_Brizz I don't disagree with this point, personally, however I will say that if Google is trying to position themselves as a competitor to Apple in this arena, they have to be able to compete with Apple. They need to get to 5 years of support, even if it's not on major versions (but it would be easier for them to just support major versions). Xavier Great point about maybe just providing security updates for 5 years. Can't expect Google to keep providing new features for old devices, but should expect to continue secure usage after three years without being a whiz. Miguel Angel My iPhone 5S runs just fine. But it is about a year old. Once you own a device for 3+ years that's when things start to wear down regardless of software. But still it would be great to get 3 years of support instead of 2. Mark McCoskey Google really should extend their OS support to 3-4 years, instead of just 2. Most people don't need a new phone every 2 years. Only those who are hard on their devices, and those who chase new technology. destinyhud i used my nexus 4 for 3 years. I was always on the latest version of the OS for that 3 years. There was this 1 month whe i was waiting for my nexus 6p to show up and thats when i was one version behind. but sure 3 years is not going to hurt either Mark McCoskey Still using my 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6. Waiting to find out what "Taimen" is, or whether an US Android One will be released. james fuston > and those who chase new technology That's kind of the name of the game. Every major US carrier tries to get you to trade in your phone after 12 months for an upgrade. Making money is the entire point of the spec race in smartphone manufacturing. thereasoner You can stay up to date for 3 years/OS versions and securty patches continue into year 4 of the Pixels life. More than enough for most I'm thinking but resale value would improve if a 4th OS version was made available. Thing is, how will the phone perform at that point? Those iPhones that get that old have been known to slow down considerably. mattcoz You don't need to update every 2 years, you'll still be on the latest release through the 3rd year. If you're someone who doesn't have the desire to upgrade after 3 years, you likely don't care that much about being on the latest version of Android anyway. It's not like the phone will stop working. Knowledgeborn Allah Google launched the Pixel to directly compete with the iPhone. That's why the two devices are priced the same. So, given that agenda, why doesn't Google also match the support that Apple gives the iPhone? 2 years of OS updates is pretty ridiculous in 2017, seeing how powerful modern devices are getting. Just to compare the 2 platforms, keep in mind that the iPhone 5 is going to get updated to iOS 10.3.2 when it officially gets released, and the iPhone 5s is getting updated to iOS 11 this summer. Meanwhile, the Nexus 6 is beyond its EOL mark. Let that sink in. Naxx ENVY it sunk in.. feels bad .. can i un-sink it ? Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, un-sink it... 😂😂😂 DKS Funny, I didn't read about this policy on Google's sustainability PR page -- environment.google Theuntje Google.. I love you.. but be more like Apple in terms of updating your phones PANDAMONIUM🚀 I thought Google already did EOD on the Pixel line up, they're pretty difficult to purchase. /s Trysta I know there is some debate as to who exactly is responsible for this. But regardless this sucks. At the very least the 2 years support clock should start the very last day that Google has the pixels for sale. Considering how hard it is to actually purchase these phones, one should be guaranteed 2 years of full support regardless of when they were able to purchase. But obviously that is fantasy, this is reality, and I will continue to wonder if I could survive with an iPhone. Sir_Brizz I don't think it's all that debatable... it's mostly Qualcomm's fault, but partially Google's. mattcoz In reality, the end result would be exactly the same. Whether it's 2 years from release or 2 years from 10 months after release, the latest update you would get is still P. TechGuy22 fuck that better sell my pixel XL before i lose all my money Siddharth Just cant get more excited for all the bugs that would hit the Pixel/XL with Android O and Android P! Adam Hunter Security patches are more important than OS updates. It's good to see Google committing to 3 years for security patches. create812 I can barely hold out for two full years before upgrading anyway. The hardware improvements usually tip the scale for me. Masklayer So... my $30 Windows phone has been supported longer...? PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan It has but Windows Mobile is abbomination and even Microsoft stopped taking it seriously. Virtually all android apps from MS are better than win apps even for desktop. Masklayer k . TechGuy22 i'm sure the phone can update until 2030 but hey, they gonna sell new phones Sir_Brizz No compromises device comparable to the iPhone. 4Ui812 I thought the Fixel was on life support since it's release. Wasn't that why Google kept trying to fix the problems with it ? Jesse Lee Root your damn phones already and run a custom ROM software that includes all the Google updates!! It's your phone, run what you want on it already and STFU Naxx ENVY you mean ,.. run what you want from other developers .. or are you saying we should learn how to code so we can make and port android version to our phones? dur., xtess3ractx Google should really flex some muscle here along with the other OEMs and extend the period by at least a year. An additional 2(4 years total) would be great. Cael Qualcomm wants to sell new chips whispy_snippet Until batteries have significantly better battery longevity it matters little. What good is an up to date phone if you need to charge it every few hours? This is one area where Samsung is taking the lead with their new S8 battery. We'll see if it delivers on the promise, but it's a good aim to have. Jay That argument is irrelevant in parts of the world like Asia. You can walk into a phone repair store, put down 30 usd and walk out with a new battery in an hour. You get get a lot of parts for your phone replaced and half the price that it costs in the u.s. and uk. People keep their phones. whispy_snippet Ok, sure, but that's a non-official work around that likely voids one's warranty immediately. Correct? In theory, you could keep replacing batteries for a decade or more. By extension, your logic implies a phone OEM should provide software support indefinitely. This isn't realistic. I'm not saying Google and others shouldn't commit to longer software support. But given Android phones consist of so many hardware variations it makes ongoing support almost impossible. Apple have the advantage here in that they have tighter control of their hardware meaning they can commit to longer software support. I don't see any of this changing for the broader Android ecosystem any time soon. Google, on the other hand, is probably looking at designing its own chips for the Pixel to help bridge the software update gap to Apple and the iPhone. boop "Ok, sure, but that's a non-official work around that likely voids one's warranty immediately. Correct?" If your phone's in-warranty, get the battery replaced by the issuer. 2 years out, it's likely out of warranty in which case there's nothing to void. "Google, on the other hand, is probably looking at designing its own chips" In the Chromebook space, minimum 6.5 year lifespan (and likely still updated indefinitely afterward), they cooperate with SoC manufacturers to maximize performance in crOS under the [optional] OP1 brand. While I doubt Google would make their own, it's possible OP1 SoCs could find their way to Android phones. whispy_snippet "If your phone's in-warranty, get the battery replaced by the issuer. 2 years out, it's likely out of warranty in which case there's nothing to void." That's a fair point. But my other key point still stands - it's hard for Google and other OEM's to offer software support as long as a company like Apple given the variations in hardware out there running Android. pfmiller Google isn't supporting every hardware variation that Android runs on, they're only supporting the devices they ship. Same as Apple. Jay We aren't talking warranty. We're talking replacing your battery which will allow you to keep your device a little longer. I see your point. You could also stop into a Sony, Huawei, Samsung Etc and get your battery officially replaced by them as well.

Is google just lazy or there is another reason? PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Follow the trend of big boys like Sammy Miguel Angel Google would need their SOC. It's unfortunate Samsung didn't care to update their phones besides having their own. mattcoz That's plenty, that's 3 years being on the latest release and up to date with security. sebastianer I think 5 years would be plenty...but 2.....is less than ok. mattcoz It's really 3 years, it'll get O and P and get security updates until the release of Q and the Pixel 4. Although I think they really should extend security updates past that, gotta keep your stragglers safe. SomeGuy112 It's said this at the bottom of the Pixels official spec page ever since they took pre-orders for the phone. https://madeby.google.com/phone/specs/ BehemothPL I only came here for comments. Btw, it's available in Play Store (well, it was yesterday). Mike What do the Pixel fans have to say ? BTW I'm loving the Galaxy S8+! Naxx ENVY the galaxy s8 gets even less support... that's what they saying LOL Mike Delevopment for Samsung phones are strong on XDA . Too bad I cant say the same for Pixel and Nexus phones. UniBroW Zero chance I'll drop 700+ on a phone that isn't going to see 5 years of updates or at least two once they stop selling them. I do not care what the reason is, it's inexcusable in 2017 and especially for someone that had the clout such as Google e_hekuta Please Google, design a Google SoC to Pixel 3, with 3 years of Android OS Updates :'( Or together with the other manufacturers convince($) to qualcomm to change the polyce of 2 years of guaranted updates, at least in high ends SoCs (835/845) tansuperman This is why people switch to iphone tansuperman All the arguments make no sense. Apple supports their phones, not the soc chop makers they use. wittyname9000 I'm sorry but two years of official OS updates on a device that is as expensive as the Pixel is a bummer. If a ragtag group of dev(s) over at XDA can get things working on much older hardware then Google needs to get it done. Just my two cents. David If you guys don't like that Google doesn't support their devices like Apple then don't buy their phones. It's not going to change anytime soon so you aren't doing anything by complaining about it. I change my phone every year so it doesn't bother me. username_not_valid People keep saying 'blame Qualcomm', but how is it then that lineage/CM ROMS pop up with newer OS versions? Are they using older drivers? If so then it seems like the older drivers work fine. I grant you, often Lineage/CM isnt the most stable thing, but then again its not Google, who should in theory do a better job.

Hate to say it but at this price people are better off buying an iPhone NavyVeteran Pixel XL 2 better be over 5.8" or its a no go. 5.5" phones are uncivilized.

It's not profitable that and end-user keep using a phone for more than 2 years. It's like the urban legend, that says that Apple on its updates, decreases performance on older phones, forcing users to get new ones, even if they are still functional. ericshmerick Uh, Apple is absolutely king here as hard as that is to say. It's no contest if you want to keep your phone for many years. Yes I understand how they are able to do this (i.e. hardware control). Google needs to hop on this with it's Pixel line. Hussain Ahmadi Just another proof that google sucks! Hopefully this year I am switching back to Samsung. Samsung also offers 2 years of update and added to this I am getting a phone that is designed well and its screen looks amazing with tons of options rather than the sepia screens of google which are covered by a huge bezel! Miguel Angel This is not fair, Google needs to do something about Qualcomm and bump it up to 3 years of software support. My old iPhone 5s still gets updates. It's unfortunate the best Android choice for updates doesn't go beyond 2 years for non security updates. And no I don't want to rely on XDA ROMs. Tolgay Günay Google said already their Devices get always 2 Years Support, not longer. God Thanks i haven't switched to Pixel. Nexus 6P for life. Groud Frank At this point I see absolutely no advantage of, say, getting a Pixel XL over a Galaxy Note 8 besides quick updates. Samsung has better hardware and far more useful software. I went from Note 3 to Nexus 6 and I wasn't all that impressed.

Now known as Waymo, the Alphabet self-driving car unit is letting residents of Phoenix sign up to use its vehicles, a major step toward commercializing a technology that could one day upend transportation. For the service, Waymo is adding 500 customised Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its fleet. Waymo has already tested these vehicles, plus other makes and models, on public roads, but only with its employees and contractors as testers. By opening the doors to the general public with a larger fleet, the company will get data on how people experience and use self-driving cars and clues on ways to generate revenue from the technology.  "We're at the point when it's really important to find how real people, outside the Google environment, will use this technology," said John Krafcik, Waymo's CEO. "Our goal is that they will use this for all their transportation needs." Share this story A row of Google "Waymo" self-driving Lexus cars outside the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. File photo: Eric Risberg / AP Waymo is letting people across parts of the Phoenix metropolitan area apply for the service as part of an "early rider program." Initial users will be able to book Waymo's minivans using an app, but won't have to pay. Dollars will flow eventually, Krafcik said, yet he declined to share details. The company is signing up hundreds of people with diverse backgrounds and transportation needs.  Google is a pioneer in autonomous cars, launching its research program in 2009. After mostly ignoring the project for several years, the auto industry has recently rushed to catch up, pumping billions of dollars into similar technology and engineering talent. A bevy of newcomers have joined too, including some founded by former Waymo engineers, making the field incredibly competitive before anyone has made money. Uber Technologies Inc. has emerged as a particularly bitter rival. Last year, autonomous vehicles run by the ride-hailing giant began picking up paying customers in Pittsburgh. Earlier this year, it started doing the same in Tempe, a town in the eastern part of the Phoenix metro area. Yet Waymo insists its business model will be broader than Uber's. Read also: Self-driving race winners get all the way round "Yes, self-driving technology makes sense for ride-sharing," said Krafcik, a former executive at Hyundai Motor's US operations and Ford Motor. "It also makes sense for personal car ownership." Transportation to and from transit hubs and logistics also made his list. In Phoenix, Krafcik said participants will use the autonomous minivan fleet every day, at any time, to go anywhere within an area twice the size of San Francisco. Last year, Waymo inked a deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for 100 Pacifica vans outfitted with Waymo's software and tailored hardware. Waymo added the fleet to the to 70 other cars it is testing in California, Texas, Washington and Arizona, which it entered in 2016. Since Google started its program, those vehicles have racked up nearly 3 million test miles on public roads, primarily to refine the autonomous software and ensure the system could handle rare but potentially dangerous edge cases. Waymo has faced criticism for not launching a commercial service sooner. This was especially true last year when it lost several top engineers, and Uber launched its limited test service. Krafcik has often responded by pointing to safety concerns and technical obstacles to deploying fully driverless cars.  The Phoenix service answers some of these concerns. It's a clear move beyond the research phase that focuses on passenger experience and business model development. Waymo's staff has worked on new displays and controls to get people comfortable being inside self-driving cars. The Phoenix passengers will be the first to see these tools in action.  Waymo is still moving cautiously. Chosen users for the Phoenix service will sit in passenger seats, and Waymo will put contractor or employee testers in the driver seat although Krafcik said the goal is to remove them eventually. The company has quietly been testing the service with a handful of Phoenix residents for two months. From those trials, he noted one behaviour trait when no one has to drive. "People have a better opportunity to bond and connect inside the vehicle," he said.   BLOOMBERG Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 EFF's Floyd marries his ANC sweetheart 2 Eskom confirms that Russians will continue nuclear bid 3 Couple to be charged with illegally keeping lions after boy dies 4 No ANC presidency campaigning under way, says Mbete 5 Zuma wins Cosatu #MayDay battle Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

Digital Trends Home > Home Theater > Meet MHL, the easiest link from your phone to your… Meet MHL, the easiest link from your phone to your TV By Rick Stella — April 28, 2017 5:20 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Thanks to Google’s Chromecast and a host of other options, wireless streaming from your phone to your TV has never been easier. However, if you’re looking for something a bit more reliable — and with a few more options — you may want to utilize a little known technology called MHL. Using an MHL connection to wire your phone directly to your display via HDMI may not be as convenient as wireless streaming, but for a variety of reasons, it’s an enticing option. The thing is, many people are unaware the technology even exists. For those looking to figure out what those three little letters on your TV or A/V receiver’s HDMI input actually do, we’re here to lay it out for you. The following covers all the basics of MHL so you can take full advantage of the technology and its capabilities. Now let’s get to sending all the coolest stuff on your phone to your TV — the old fashioned way. What is MHL? In 2010, a band of electronics companies, including Sony and Nokia, developed the MHL connection protocol. Short for Mobile High-Definition Link, MHL utilizes a specially equipped HDMI input on compatible TVs and A/V receivers to connect a growing list of smartphones, tablets, and other devices. The standard takes smartphone and tablet content to the next level, allowing you to showcase everything from your phone on your TV with a single connection. How do I use MHL? The most common way to connect for most people is to use an MHL adapter such as the one shown below, which consists of a male Micro USB plug on one end and a female HDMI port on the other. If your phone hosts a Micro USB port, all you need to do is simply connect an MHL adaptor to your phone, and run an HDMI cable from the adaptor to the MHL-enabled HDMI port on your television (the correct port will be labeled “MHL”) and you’re all set. If your phone or tablet does not host a Micro USB port, you’ll also need another adapter, which we’ll discuss in more detail in the next section below. A typical MHL adapter. When MHL first launched, adapters like the one shown above were more or less the primary way to utilize the technology. Now, though, there are lots of different cables that support MHL, including direct Micro USB-to-HDMI cables. The next step is simply plugging in your compatible device, which will allow you to display all of its applications, games, movies, photos, and music right on your TV, with resolution at 4K Ultra HD (and above). Does my device work with MHL? KPG_Payless / Shutterstock.com If you’re thinking about looking into MHL, you should make sure your device and display are compatible with the protocol by checking the official MHL site — found here — for a full list of supported devices. If your display device isn’t on the list, don’t bother buying an MHL adapter — it’s not going to work. If your display device is on the list, but your mobile device isn’t, there are also some other ways to connect. If you’re an Apple enthusiast, your iPhone or iPad does not have the correct output for the default MHL adapter or cable described above. Luckily, there are workarounds for iFans; any device with a Lightning port (most newer iOS products have them) can be used with one of the adapters found here. You can then connect to an MHL adapter, such as the one pictured above, or an MHL to HDMI cable. Some newer Android phones have USB Type-C ports, rather than Micro USB; they’ll need third-party adapters to work with MHL as well. In the same vein, most compatible Samsung phones require a different (eleven-pin) adapter, as the default (five-pin) adapter won’t properly interface. Just like with Apple products, there are also third-party direct connectors for these devices. However, be aware that these won’t charge your phone like standard MHL. Why use MHL? Great question! As mentioned, there are several wireless methods that work for mirroring mobile devices to bigger screens; Apple’s AirPlay for iPhones and iPads, for example, or Miracast for Android devices. And of course, Google’s Chromecast lets you stream video and audio from multiple apps. These methods don’t always offer the same level of video and sound quality as MHL, but the wireless connection is more convenient for many applications. However, there are many use cases where MHL could come in handy. The system is especially useful for those without cable or internet, for instance. In such a case, MHL essentially turns your phone and TV into a full-blown entertainment center, no Wi-Fi required. In addition, there are a few protocol-specific benefits that might make it worth going with MHL. First, MHL connections tout the convenient ability to transmit control data, which essentially means the remote that controls your television may also be able to control the connected device. For mobile gamers, MHL connection also offers zero latency, which allows for lag-free display of your device on your TV during the most rigorous of gaming sessions. The cable also charges mobile devices up to 40W without any subsequent lag while displaying the content. Where else can I use MHL? As we’re sure you’ve surmised by this point, MHL’s most useful function is to send data from a smartphone or tablet to a compatible TV or A/V receiver lag-free. However, MHL also lets you plug your smartphone or tablet into a car’s compatible infotainment system, as well as a compatible computer monitor at home or at work. By plugging a phone or tablet into a compatible car hookup, you’ll have the ability to utilize up-to-the-second traffic reports, charge your device while commuting, and access your personal music library. The system gives easy touchscreen access to all content on your phone right through the infotainment center. Likewise, plugging a smartphone or tablet into a compatible computer monitor can turn your device into a work station, one you can pair with a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse to create a (semi) fully-functioning mini office. How much does MHL cost? Another reason MHL is a viable choice is the fact that an adapter won’t cost you an arm and a leg. Adapters can run as little as $9 (or less), though you’ll still need a long HDMI cable such as this one from Monoprice, which runs another $12-13 or so. Depending upon the adapters or cables you need, getting set up with MHL can cost anywhere from $10 to $40, which is pretty affordable any way you slice it. So there you go. Now you’re ready to get down and dirty with MHL. Time to start streaming to that TV, latency-free!
