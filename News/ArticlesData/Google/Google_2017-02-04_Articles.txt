Specifically, those relying on the launcher as their Android home screen UI. Certified Android OEMs have access to the Google Mobile Services package which contains essential-carry apps like Gmail, YouTube and Drive. It also carried optional elements like the Google Now Launcher, an advanced version of the stock AOSP launcher that integrated what was known as Google Now (now the “Feed“) into the leftmost panel of the interface. Manufacturers were free to utilize the launcher at their will. But thanks to a new effort around the “Google Search Launcher Services library,” OEMs can now code in the Feed to be the leftmost panel of their own UI skin on top of Android. It’s being described as “a more scalable solution” — as they say, though, it takes a village to be “scalable” and Android manufacturers have not historically come together as a village. In a letter to developers obtained by Android Police, Google has scheduled the demise of the Google Now Launcher. The launcher, which has been available as a Play Store app, will leave circulation within this quarter. On March 1, the GMS options package will drop the launcher. Developers who opt for a replacement can utilize the “SearchLauncher” app within GMS that already couples the GSLS library with AOSP Launcher3. The end user version of the Google Now Launcher will still be supported through updates to the Google search app after it leaves the Play Store — the majority of Nexus devices utilize it and if you have it downloaded, you’ll also get the updates, too. Don’t get your hopes up for seeing the Pixel Launcher move into prominence, though — while it is available in the Play Store, its device base still seems to be stuck with the Pixels. Now, if those contingent Google Assistant services that supposedly “make” the Pixel Launcher “tick” were to be indexed — as it is when bootlegged on another device, the Feed can’t be popped out. We’ve transcribed the letter, dated from February 2, below: Hello Android Partners, Google Search Launcher Services library allows you to implement easy access to Google Now cards by swiping right on the default home screen of your own launcher. Its evaluation version for Android 7.0 and 7.1 was announced and shared at the end of last year. Thanks to the partners who have supported the test and evaluation, we are happy to announce that the library is now good for production use. Please feel free to integrate the library with your production launcher, following the supporting documents published on the GMS site. Going forward, we will provide the updated version of the library with the monthly GMS bundle update. Since the Search Launcher Services library is a more scalable solution, we’re discontinuing the Google Now Launcher over the following timeline: Q1 2017 – Google Now Launcher will be unpublished from Google Play. Although users would not be able to download and install the launcher from Google Play Store, Google will continue to supporting existing users of the Google Now Launcher by updating the Google Search app. March 1, 2017 – Google Now Launcher will be removed from optional GMS. New devices with Google Now Launcher on the system image will no longer be approved. However, partner devices can keep shipping Google Now Launcher if they were approved before the cut-off date. These devices do not have to replace the Google Now Launcher with something else after they’ve updated to [a] newer version of the Android platform. If your products relied on the Google Now Launcher and you are looking for an immediate replacement, please consider using the SearchLauncher app that is included in the GMS distribution. It integrates the Search Launcher Services library with the AOSP Launcher3, and you may use the app for your production devices. Please contact your technical account manager if you have any questions. Thanks, The Android Team Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

But this new device follows on the back of the previous Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL releases; so how do these devices compare with the undoubted market leader, the iPhone 7? Image Source: Amazon.com Size Firstly, the iPhone 7 is the most compact of the four devices at 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 in). This compares favorably with the Google Pixel, with its size being 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5 mm (5.66 x 2.74 x 0.33 in). However, the Google Pixel XL – 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5 mm (6.09 x 2.98 x 0.33 in) – is the smaller of the two phablets, with the iPhone 7 Plus measuring 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 in). Weight The iPhone 7 is also marginally lighter than the Google Pixel, but the iPhone 7 Plus is significantly heavier than the Google Pixel XL. It is certainly surprising that the iPhone 7 Plus is a full 50 grammes heavier than its smaller cousin. Display Both of the Google Pixel devices have superior screen resolution to their Apple counterparts. The iPhone 7 can display only 750 x 1,334 Pixels, compared to the full HD resolution of the Google Pixel. While the iPhone 7 Plus resolution is beefed up to full HD, the Google Pixel XL is a quad HD smartphone. Apple has certainly fallen behind the pack slightly in this department, and there will be pressure on the Californian corporation to deliver an increased screen resolution when the iPhone 8 is released. Screen size The Google Pixel has a somewhat larger screen than the iPhone 7, with the Google smartphone featuring a five-inch display compared to the 4.7-inch screen of the Apple contender. Both of the phablets are fitted with 5.5-inch displays. The extra size of the Google Pixel of course helps to explain why the weight of the device is higher. Processor Exactly the same quad-core 2.34 GHz processor (2 x Hurricane + 2 x Zephyr) is fitted in both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This gives the Apple device the edge of the Google Pixel range, with both handsets being armed with quad-core processors (2 x 2.15 GHz Kryo & 2 x1.6 GHz Kryo). When coupled with the proprietary software of the Apple corporation, it must be said that this translates into a pretty significant performance advantage. Storage The various storage quantities offered by the devices are listed below: iPhone 7 – 32 / 128 / 256GB iPhone 7 Plus – 32 / 128 / 256GB Google Pixel – 32 / 128GB Google Pixel XL – 32 / 128GB Apple smartphones must be given the edge in this department, purely due to the 256GB option offered in both iPhone 7 models. It is interesting that Apple has particularly emphasized this aspect of smartphone performance, with the corporation obviously envisaging that consumers will wish to store significant amounts of media within their iPhone devices. This probably feeds into the Apple App Store; such a massively important source of revenue for the market-leading consumer electronics company. RAM Both of the Google Pixel handsets are armed with 4GB of RAM, meaning that they have a significant advantage over both of their Apple rivals. Indeed, the smartphone version of the Pixel has double the RAM of the 2GB smartphone iPhone 7. The iPhone 7 Plus does feature 3GB of RAM, but Google has clearly won out in this area. Nonetheless, Apple’s combination of proprietary hardware and software is known to deliver outstanding results regardless of raw specs. Camera All four of the cameras included in these devices deliver 12-megapixels, suggesting that the photographic capabilities of this quartet of handsets is rather similar. This is a reasonable conclusion, but it is worth noting that Apple includes quad-LED in both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, while the Google Pixel devices have only dual-LED. It will be interesting to see what Apple can do to develop the camera in the iPhone 8 generation, and the device has already been linked with some outstanding and revolutionary technology. Battery The batteries included in both of the Google Pixel offerings are significantly larger than either of the iPhone 7 releases. The smartphone-sized iPhone 7 is fitted with a non-removable Li-Ion 1960 mAh battery. This compares with the non-removable Li-Ion 2770 mAh unit included in the Google Pixel. The larger iPhone 7 Plus has a non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery, but the Pixel XL features a non-removable Li-Ion 3450 mAh cell. This perhaps helps to explain why Apple has struggled with battery lifecycle in recent iPhone generations. Endurance rating Both of the Google Pixel devices marginally outperform their Apple counterparts in this critical aspect of smartphone performance. The iPhone 7 delivers an endurance rating of 61 hours; slightly less than the 64 hours offered by the Google Pixel. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7 Plus offers an endurance rating of 75 hours, still three hours less than the 78 hours delivered by the Pixel XL. Conclusion The specs of the Google Pixels certainly compare favorably to the iPhone 7, as perhaps could have been anticipated. Unlike Samsung, Apple has never concentrated on cramming excessive specs into devices, and has instead focused its attention on ensuring that the iPhone is as slick a package as possible. Nonetheless, the performance and advantages that the iPhone achieves via its combination of superior processing speed and proprietary hardware and software are far from insignificant, and help to continue to propel the iPhone to the very top of the consumer electronics industry.

Millions of people watching Super Bowl 51 today will get a taste of Google Home. Google Home. The tech giant will air a 1-minute Super Bowl advertisement during the big game this afternoon that features its smart speaker. Google just posted the ad here on YouTube. It’s a mash-up of people coming home and using Google’s $129 device to play music, turn on lights, answer questions, and more. If the commercial looks familiar, that’s because Google is re-using the same ad it published online back in October. Google Home debuted this past November and competes directly with Amazon’s popular Echo device. Some reviewers say Home is “smarter” than the Echo, but lags behind Amazon’s device when it comes to integrating third-party apps. As connected devices, appliances, and security systems become increasingly mainstream, Google and Amazon have emerged as chief competitors for the voice operating system of the home, though Amazon certainly has an early lead. FOX is charging around $5 million for a 30-second Super Bowl ad this year, so Google likely paid a bit more for its 1-minute commercial. This isn’t Google’s first Super Bowl ad — it ran a spot in 2010 that focused on its search engine. Amazon hasn’t pre-released any Super Bowl ads this year and it’s unclear if we’ll see something from the company later today during the game. Amazon aired a popular Super Bowl ad last year that featured the Echo. Other tech companies that paid for Super Bowl spots this year include T-Mobile, Intel, Squarespace, Nintendo, GoDaddy, Sprint, and Wix.

That means plenty of concepts will come our way like the lovely Google Pixel 2 design from Babak Soren. We got a look at our first solid concept of the Google Pixel 2 design a few weeks ago. While it was certainly slick with its chamfered edges, today’s new concept is more along the lines of something we might see. The design language in the new Google Pixel 2 keeps things familiar but the designer has added one thing that’s going to become common by next year. On the back of the Google Pixel 2 renders you’ll see the two-tone style is back although the fingerprint scanner appears to have moved a smidge. There is a Dual Rear camera setup with a flash, but it looks like the 2016 model. The front tells a different tale. The phone has an edgeless display with minimal bezel at the bottom. The top appears to be transparent to a degree as well with notifications showing up along the top edge. While today’s Google Pixel 2 design concept may not be the most thrilling from a design standpoint, there’s one reason we dig it. We don’t expect Google to change things up drastically with the Google Pixel 2 release arrives as it will only be the second generation. People love the look of the backside, so changing up the front is an obvious way to go – especially considering all the slim-bezeled phones we except to see this year. via – Concept Phones    source: dkarren   Tags androidconceptsGoogle Pixel 2smartphones Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: Huawei P10 price rumored to begin at $500 Next article Next post: iPhone 8 concept design shows transparency Adam Adam is a techie, who loves new gadgets and all things Westeros.

She spent a lot of her career (so far) serving the technology needs of libraries, and has been a contributor since 2008 to the Koha open source library automation suite.Ruth is currently a Perl Developer at cPanel in Houston, and also serves as chief of staff for two cats. » More about me Learn how you can contribute Building your own personal cloud with Cozy Posted 01 Feb 2017 D Ruth BavousettFeed 14up 8 comments Image by :  Pixabay. Modified by Opensource.com. CC BY-SA 4.0 Most everyone I know uses some sort of web-based application for their calendar, emails, file storage, and much more. But what if, like me, you've got concerns about privacy, or just want to simplify your digital life into a place you control? Cozy is a project that is moving in the right direction—toward a robust self-hosted cloud platform. Cozy's source code is available on GitHub, and it is licensed under the AGPL 3.0 license. Installation Installing Cozy is snap-easy, with easy-to-follow instructions for a variety of platforms. For my testing, I'm using Debian 8, 64-bit. The installation takes a few minutes, but then you just go to the server's IP, register an account, and a default set of applications is loaded up and ready to roll. One note on this—the installation assumes no other web server is running, and it will want to install Nginx web server. If your server already has websites running, configuration may be a bit more challenging. My install was on a brand new Virtual Private Server (VPS), so this was a snap. Run the installer, start Nginx, and you're ready to hit the cloud. Cozy has an App Store where you can download additional applications. Some look pretty interesting, like the Ghost blogging platform and TiddlyWiki open source wiki. The intent here, clearly, is to allow integration in the platform with lots of other goodies. I think it's just a matter of time before you'll see this start to take off, with many other popular open source applications offering integration abilities. Right now, Node.js applications are supported, but if other application layers were possible, you'd see that many other good things could happen. One capability that is possible is using the free Android application to access your information from Android devices. No iOS app exists, but there is a plan to solve that problem. Currently, Cozy comes with a nice set of core applications. Main Cozy interface Files Like a lot of folks, I use Dropbox for file storage. In fact, I pay for Dropbox Pro because I use so much storage. For me, then, moving my files to Cozy would be a money-saver—if it has the features I want. I wish I could say it does, truly I do. I was very impressed with the web-based file upload and file-management tool built into the Cozy web application. Drag-and-drop works like you'd expect, and the interface is clean and uncluttered. I had no trouble at all uploading some sample files and folders, navigating around, and moving, deleting, and renaming files. If what you want is a web-based cloud file storage, you're set. What's missing, for me, is the selective synchronization of files and folders, which Dropbox has. With Dropbox, if you drop a file in a folder, it's copied out to the cloud and made available to all your synced devices in a matter of minutes. To be fair, Cozy is working on it, but it's in beta and only for Linux clients at the moment. Also, I have a Chrome extension called Download to Dropbox that I use to capture images and other content from time to time, and no such tool exists yet for Cozy. File Manager interface Importing data from Google If you currently use Google Calendar or Contacts, importing these is very easy with the app installed in Cozy. When you authorize access to Google, you're given an API key, which you paste in Cozy, and it performs the copy quickly and efficiently. In both cases, the contents were tagged as having been imported from Google. Given the clutter in my contacts, this is probably a good thing, as it gives you the opportunity to tidy up as you relabel them into more meaningful categories. Calendar events imported all on the "Google Calendar," but I noticed that some of my events had the times incorrect, possibly an artifact of time zone settings on one end or the other. Contacts   Contacts works like you'd expect, and the interface looks a lot like Google Contacts. There are a few sticky areas, though. Synchronization with (for instance) your smart phone happens via CardDAV, a standard protocol for sharing contacts data—and a technology that Android phones do not speak natively. To sync your contacts to an Android device, you're going to have to load an app on your phone for that. For me, that's a huge strike against it, as I have enough odd apps like that already (work mail versus Gmail versus other mail, oh my!), and I do not want to install another that won't sync up with my smartphone's native contacts application. If you're using an iPhone, you can do CardDAV right out of the box. Calendar   The good news for Calendar users is that an Android device can speak CalDAV, the interchange format for this type of data. As I noted with the import app, some of my calendar items came over with the wrong times. I've seen this before with other calendar system moves, so that really didn't bother me much. The interface lets you create and manage multiple calendars, just like with Google, but you can't subscribe to other calendars outside of this Cozy instance. One other quirk is of the app is starting of the week on Monday, which you can't change. Normally, I start my week on Sunday, so changing from Monday would be a useful feature for me. The Settings dialog didn't actually have any settings; it merely gave instructions on how to connect via CalDAV. Again, this application is close to what I need, but Cozy is not quite there. Photos The Photos app is pretty impressive, borrowing a lot from the Files application. You can even add photos to an album that are in files in the other app, or upload directly with drag and drop. Unfortunately, I don't see any way to reorder or edit pictures once you've uploaded them. You can only delete them from the album. The app does have a tool for sharing via a token link, and you can specify one or more contact. The system will send those contacts an email inviting them to view the album. There are more feature-rich album applications than this, to be sure, but this is a good start for the Cozy platform. Photos interface Final thoughts Cozy has some really big goals. They're trying to build a platform where you can deploy any cloud-based service you like. Is it ready for prime time? Not quite. Some of the shortcomings I've mentioned are problematic for power users, and there is no iOS application yet, which may hamper adoption for those users. However, keep an eye on this one—Cozy has the potential, as development continues, to become a one-stop replacement for a great many applications.

I think OwnCloud is trying to do many of the same things - a contrasting review would be interesting. reply Vote up! 1 Vote down! 0 D Ruth Bavousett on 02 Feb 2017 Permalink That's a great idea! While Cozy isn't *quite* what I need it to be yet, the concerns that made me look at it in the first place are still there. Looking at OwnCloud and Nextcloud is a good next step. I'll look into doing that in the coming couple of months. Thanks for the suggestion. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 ItsMeFIZ on 01 Feb 2017 Permalink How does this compare to Nextcloud? reply Vote up! 1 Vote down! 0 D Ruth Bavousett on 02 Feb 2017 Permalink I wasn't aware of Nextcloud! As I noted above, comparing Cozy to other similar open source projects is, IMO, a fantastic idea, so I'm going to set out doing that. I'm working with the editorial team to do that over the next couple of months. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 tj on 02 Feb 2017 Permalink I`m using Nextcloud since it was forked from Owncloud and tried out the Cozy-VM for a few minutes. According to the manual the setup of Cozy should be much easier (as long as there is no webserver already installed), since it installes and configures the webserver automatically. I also prefer its WebUI, but it has a major downside if you plan on setting up a private cloud for multiple users, since its basically not possible. In Nextcloud you can add users within seconds, while its almost impossible with Cozy. Also very interesting for some might be the possiblity to add online document editing in Nextcloud with Collabora Online (CODE), which is basically Libreoffice online. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Marco Fioretti on 03 Feb 2017 Permalink Cozy is an excellent system, but personal clouds for the masses need to be a) simpler than that, federated to each other and able to interface with (at least) Facebook. Otherwise they won't be adopted enough. Your comments on my personal proposal for such an alternative, available at http://per-cloud.com, are very welcome reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Raymond Stomp on 07 Feb 2017 Permalink IMHO interfacing with Facebook and other similar commercial parties will always cost you privacy. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Fungal on 05 Feb 2017 Permalink I suspect you will find NextCloud and OwnCloud quite mature (due to the split, many staff went to NextCloud along with shared mature code), but in the same breath you may find it more heavy weighted, where as COZY appears to be more of a light weight when it comes to minimum requirements. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Comment now Login or Register to earn points for your comments.

Global perspective. advertisement Federal judge orders Google to comply with search warrant Sunday 5 February 2017 at 2:59 PM ET by Mark Casper ©  WikiMedia (No machine-readable author provided. Surka~commonswiki assumed (based on copyright claims).) [JURIST] A judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania [official website] on Friday ordered [text, PDF] Google [corporate website] to disclose certain information found in foreign-stored e-mails, as requested by an FBI search warrant. This decision conflicts with a previous Second Circuit Court ruling, which was most recently denied a rehearing [JURIST report]. By virtue of the way e-mails are distributed on Google's e-mail server, the tech corporation was unable to decipher whether certain sought-after e-mails were sent and received in the US and, following the Second Circuit ruling, refused to provide the FBI with the potentially foreign e-mails. The judge said, because "the invasion of privacy will occur in the United States" and "the searches of the electronic data disclosed by Google pursuant to the warrants will occur in the United States," the requested information falls within an acceptable domestic use of the Stored Communications Act [materials]. In addition, the judge stated there was no seizure, as no "meaningful interference" with the e-mail account holder's "possessory interest." Technology continues to raise important privacy questions. In April Microsoft sued [JURIST report] the US Department of Justice regarding the privacy of their customers' e-mails. Microsoft filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington in an attempt to block authorities from taking customer e-mails without Microsoft's knowledge. Also in April the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled [JURIST report] that obtaining phone location records without a warrant was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. In November 2015 the US Supreme Court rejected a case [JURIST report] to determine whether it is necessary to obtain a search warrant when law enforcement requests access to cell phone location data. In October of 2015 California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law [JURIST report] the California Electronic Communications Act (CECA), a law that many are touting as a substantial step forward for digital privacy and protecting users' rights. The law, which was approved alongside more than 10 other bills, bars any state's law enforcement agency or other investigative entity from requesting sensitive metadata from persons or businesses without a warrant. Also in 2015 the European Court of Justice ruled [JURIST report] that EU user data transferred to the US by various technology companies is not sufficiently protected.

We don’t currently support Google’s RCS offering.” 9to5Google found that the supposed sources of this report turned out to be one person.   ORIGINAL: Some T-Mobile customers are getting a new messaging feature to play with today. RCS, which stands for Rich Communication Services, appears to have gone live in Google Messenger for some T-Mobile customers. Those folks are getting a notification in the Messenger app to tell them about the “enhanced features” that come with RCS, including messaging over Wi-Fi and data, high-res photo sharing, and read receipts. These features can be toggled on or off in an “Enhanced features” section of the Messenger app’s settings. T-Mobile launched its own RCS-based Advanced Messaging feature back in July 2015. That feature is now available on several T-Mo devices, including the LG G5, LG Aristo, Samsung Galaxy S7, and Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The RCS that’s hitting some T-Mobile customers’ Google Messenger app is different. Google acquired Jibe Mobile in September 2015 and began backing that RCS profile, but so far Sprint is the only US carrier that has officially adopted it. With today’s news, it looks like T-Mobile may soon adopt it as well. The bad news is that it’s currently unclear how you can get Google’s universal RCS profile in your Google Messenger app. One Reddit user suggested that T-Mobile is testing this feature with early Digits users, but T-Mo hasn’t made any official announcements about this news. I’ve reached out to T-Mobile for more info on the matter, and I’ll be sure to update this post when I hear back. Utilizing Google’s universal RCS profile in Messenger would be an interesting move from T-Mobile. While T-Mo’s RCS works between supported devices on T-Mo, adding support for Google’s RCS profile would enable T-Mo customers to also use RCS when messaging customers on other carriers that support it. That’s currently only Sprint, but it’s possible that other carriers could adopt it as well in the future. Have you ever used RCS, like T-Mobile’s Advanced Messaging?

Joseph Cathey Apple has made no mention of supporting it. T-Mobile may support the universal profile, but it’s useless if Apple doesn’t make use of it on their devices. Bonedatt I’ve had the advance messaging (aka RCS) on my Note 4 and LG G4 for a while now and on the S7 Edge since March 2016. Sometimes it works well where the recipient can see you typing your response and other times it doesn’t function as it’s supposed to. Don’t use SMS as much anymore. Almost everyone I know seems to be on whatsapp or Telegram these days. Phil7474 Been using this fire a while now on my galaxy J7. Works when another smartphone has it on tmobiles network. Doesn’t when you don’t. Eh….. Joseph Cathey That’s why this is important. Their migrating support away from individual devices and making it a carrier feature. Your phone just has to an app that supports the standard. It also means interoperability between carriers, which was not possible before. Mariano Moreira Been using on Sprint as RCS in Google Messaging started rolling out with Sprint 1st. It made SMS/MMS delivery more convoluted as at that time only other Sprint Android devices were compatible. Hopefully it will be better with more Carriers using RCS. However the cross-platform issue still arises: Hangouts, BBM, Facebook Messenger, What’s App, etc.. were able to address different OS platform. Google made things more worse by basically deciding to move away from Hangouts. (They even removed Threaded Merged Hangouts/SMS &MMS to where these are now treated as separate accounts) BBM had end-to-end encryption and somehow let their advantage completely slip…Allowing iMessage and even Allo to catch up and compete.Yet BBM is better for iOS to Android encryption because it works cross-platform. steveb944 Great news, but is it the same originally supported devices only? Joseph Cathey T-Mobile is launching Google’s universal RCS profile on the backend. The big news is that it’s no longer device specific, the messaging app itself just has to support it. Philip I use Whatsapp alot. Asian people use Wechat alot. Viber is in the middle. lion7718 I’ve used Chomp for years, but have turned Messenger back on. Have to wait & see if notice shows up on my Nexus 5X. TylerCameron Try signal. Best app I’ve used for messaging. As long as the other person uses signal, it’s fully encrypted bkat11 I’ve been using my S7’s native messaging app and noticed yesterday that customers on Metro PCS now have advanced messaging support not just T-Mobile customers. Some sort of software update was released for them. Also my S7 should be getting Nougat this week as its been in “testing” for about a week now. iCn2u T-mobile owns Metro PCS. Zach Mauch Wow, there are so many commenters here who don’t get the difference between this and T-Mobile’s previously released advanced messaging. This is despite it being clearly spelled out in the article. Sigh… SpookyTunes Another report that claims it’s all a hoax: https://9to5google.com/2017/02/01/nope-t-mobile-isnt-rolling-out-support-for-googles-rcs-offering-in-messenger/ TylerCameron How about support for Signal private messenger? Jason R Is this available yet for Nexus 5x? iCn2u Say what u mean & mean what u say. If u can’t I will. If u are a Metro PCS customer, U ARE a T-MOBILE CUSTOMER. Is this obvious enough lieutenant?!

Reg readers vote Tom Baker for Doctor 13. Of course Welcome to my world of The Unexplained – yes, you're welcome to it More like this Google Chrome Software Chrome 56 quietly added Bluetooth snitch API Trust us, says Google, we understand privacy 5 Feb 2017 at 21:41, Richard Chirgwin +Comment When Google popped out Chrome 56 at the end of January it was keen to remind us it's making the web safer by flagging non-HTTPS sites. But Google made little effort to publicise another feature that's decidedly less friendly to privacy, because it lets websites connect to Bluetooth devices and harvest information from them through the browser. Here's Pete LePage of the Chrome Developers team describing the feature: Youtube Video LePage, in the video, says: “Until now, the ability to communicate with Bluetooth devices has been possible only for native apps. With Chrome 56, your Web app can communicate with nearby Bluetooth devices in a private and secure manner, using the Web Bluetooth API. “The Web Bluetooth API uses the GATT [Generic Attribute Profile – ed.] protocol, which enables your app to connect to devices such as light bulbs, toys, heart-rate monitors, LED displays and more, with just a few lines of JavaScript.” Let's start with LePage's security-and-privacy claims: what Google means is that the server-to-browser connection is over TLS, and users have to allow connection with a touch or a mouse click. To reiterate: as a user, you have to explicitly grant the remote web app access to your Bluetooth gadgets before anything happens. Then you select a device to pair with the webpage, and away you go. The webpage can filter for devices, so for example, a health site can ask to be paired with gadgets that have a heart rate sensor. A site can't see any device until it is paired. The programming interface for this is described here and here. As pointed out to The Register last year by privacy researcher Lukasz Olejnik, the API makes it possible for site owners like Google to gather a huge amount of privacy-intrusive information from your nearby electronics. The Bluetooth Web API community would have trouble denying this, since its first example code is for retrieving data from a heart rate monitor. Reg comment It's perfectly reasonable to consider this API as another means for webpages to gather and aggregate information about users; and if challenged the industry will use familiar weasel-words about how users can experience wonderful new services users will get if they just hand over a little more private data. It basically invites the user to gradually cough up the contents of their homes and offices – from the keyboards and mice to the smart bulbs and wearables. There's nothing in the Bluetooth Web API to stipulate how all that data is stored by the site owner, so we also suppose Troy Hunt will soon need to add new fields to haveibeenpwned.com. In 2016, the Internet of s**t Things taught us that most firmware implementations look like 4:30pm-Friday-afternoon work by the last developer not to go to the pub. A vendor's canned SDK is lifted wholesale, complete with example code and default credentials and shipped. There's no reason to think this won't happen in Bluetooth Web API development. The reaction on Twitter was even harsher than ours: @ChromiumDev Right, so first thing: How do I turn this off, for security purposes? — Stuart Young (@cefiar) February 2, 2017 @cefiar @ChromiumDev And second thing, as an admin, how do I block this for all my users? — Dave (@daveidfx) February 4, 2017 Most other browsers don't make mention of the API yet, but we note Mozilla's attitude to it is “do not use it on production sites facing the web.” We agree with that stance and hope the Bluetooth Web API goes the way of the snitching W3C Battery API. ® Tips and corrections 98 Comments More from The Register EU waves antitrust claims in Google's face, snarls 'You want some?'

Photo / AP Donald Trump is not used to only being the fifth-richest person in the room, but the then president-elect was grinning nonetheless. Seated with him, at a huge table on the 25th floor of Trump Tower, was the cream of the United States technology industry: the 13 bosses in the room included Google's co-founder Larry Page, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos and Apple chief executive Tim Cook. For the Silicon Valley elite, it was a moment of humility. California had voted by two-to-one in favour of Hillary Clinton and in San Francisco's tech cluster that ratio was undoubtedly higher. Many of the chief executives around the table had criticised Trump (if mostly in private), and he had given as good as he got. At rallies on the campaign trail he had railed against the technology industry for stealing jobs, promised to launch an antitrust investigation into Amazon and said he would force Apple to make its "damn computers" in the US. The sight of those chief executives kissing the ring at the summit in December was almost reminiscent of a defeated army swallowing a peace treaty. The photographers in attendance could not fail to capture the grimaces and pursed lips of Cook, Bezos and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg. Nonetheless, the meeting appeared to mark a thawing in relations. Trump effusively praised the tech industry and said he would do all he could to ensure its success. Soon after, Oracle's chief executive Safra Catz joined Trump's transition team. Elon Musk and Travis Kalanick, the heads of Tesla and Uber respectively, signed up to his business advisory council. As the inauguration approached, technology executives began to talk about coming to terms with the election result, even acknowledging that tech had been partly responsible for the swell of disenfranchised workers that propelled Trump to power. Companies like Amazon announced plans to hire thousands of new workers in the US. Technology firms hit back But then came the inauguration, and soon after, the executive orders. Trump had promised widespread immigration controls in the run-up to the election, but many were shocked at the abrupt travel ban he signed just seven days after becoming president. He had appeared to seek a more conciliatory tone since and Peter Thiel, the PayPal billionaire who is a rare Trump supporter among the tech elite, had spread the message that Trump was to be taken seriously, but not literally. Continued below. Related Content Zain Ali: Muslim bans can be answered by 'radical hospitality' Fake news is killing people's minds, says Apple boss Tim Cook President Donald Trump says he strongly supports NATO Last month's order, which froze entry to residents of seven largely-Muslim countries, prompted a furious backlash last weekend. Technology executives tripped over themselves to deride the ban. Their comments ranged from the measured - Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he was "concerned" and Apple's Cook said it was "not a policy we support" - to the aggravated. Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix, said that "Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all." Google's co-founder Sergey Brin joined hundreds in protesting at San Francisco airport. "I'm here because I'm a refugee," he told a reporter. On Monday, the words turned to action, when Microsoft and Amazon took legal action against Trump's order, throwing their weight behind a challenge from Washington state. Cook added that Apple could follow, and would at least press the White House hard on the matter. The ban had few supporters across corporate America, but in the pro-immigration, jetsetting and naturally-optimistic tech world, it was anathema. Many dotcom bosses, including Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella, are immigrants. Silicon Valley's most famous icon, Steve Jobs, was the biological son of a refugee from Syria - one of the seven countries on Trump's blacklist. Outside the boardroom, thousands of programmers come from abroad. Thousands gather at Denver's City Center Park for a rally in support of the Muslim community and to protest President Donald Trump's executive order. Photo / AP Given the outcry among staff, tech companies knew they could not stay silent about the ban. But equally, there were fears that a shaky rapport with the new administration was at risk. Donald Trump is a man who works on deals and relationships, after all. After the drama of the last week, it may appear that tech companies are in for a particularly rough ride over the next four years. In comparison to Barack Obama, who embraced the use of social media in campaigning and sought the approval of Silicon Valley, Trump appears to have little time for technology (aside from a penchant for tweeting from his smartphone, he is said to rarely use a computer). The upside for Silicon Valley But there is an alternative school of thought that a Trump presidency could well be an unexpected boost for the industry, should they be able to swallow their pride to embrace it. The biggest opportunity for several tech giants is the very real prospect of a tax holiday, which will bring trillions of dollars back to the US. Of the estimated $2.6 trillion (£2.1 trillion) that American companies have stashed offshore, the biggest piles of cash are held by tech companies. Apple, Google's parent company Alphabet, Cisco, Oracle and Microsoft - have more than $500bn (£400bn) parked offshore between them. Almost half of that is Apple's alone. For years the company has booked sales from Europe and elsewhere in Ireland in anticipation of a tax holiday that has been a long time coming. Apple revealed last week that it has $230bn, 94pc of the company's entire cash reserves, abroad. Investors salivate at the prospect of a bonanza cash return via dividends or share buybacks, while large acquisitions could also be on the table. Currently, repatriating cash to the US imposes a punitive 35pc tax rate. A tax holiday for America's corporates has been on the table for years, but tensions between Obama's White House and a Republican Congress scuppered any prospect of a deal. Now, with Republicans running all branches of the US government, progress seems more likely. Trump has pledged to cut the 35pc to 10pc Progress could also help defuse a turbulent battle between Apple and the European Union, which has said the company is avoiding billions of taxes thanks to a sweetheart deal with the Irish government. Were Apple to pay taxes on bringing the cash back home, the EU's argument that it is avoiding them would hold less weight. Support abroad Apple is not the only one in Brussels' crosshairs. The European Commission has also charged Google with abusing its dominance on three separate fronts and Facebook with misleading regulators over its $19bn acquisition of WhatsApp. The consistency with which Europe's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has targeted Silicon Valley groups has led many inside them to claim that the charges are politically motivated. A defiant, protectionist president fond of dealmaking could well lend increased support to the companies on the international stage, not only in Europe but in China, where many of the biggest internet companies have been shut out by censorship laws, despite Chinese tech groups enjoying the freedom of New York's financial markets. The stock market's "Trump bump" also bodes well for a flurry of potential tech IPOs. Snap Inc, the company behind the messaging app Snapchat, is preparing for a flotation that could value it at as much as $25bn. If it proves successful, others such as Dropbox and Spotify are likely to follow. The US markets were starved of tech listings last year. The S&P 500's 7pc rise since the election, driven by the promise of more infrastructure spending and tax cuts, could prove a welcome catalyst. A bonfire of red tape, meanwhile, could boost start-ups, whose numbers are falling. To exploit the potential benefits of the Trump phenomenon, though, will force America's tech bosses to tread a razor-thin line. Being seen to cosy up to the organisation will play poorly with many employees, not to mention customers: Uber faced a boycott last week when it appeared to undermine a taxi strike during an anti-Trump protest, with anger compounded by Kalanick's position on Trump's business council. The outcry led to Kalanick leaving the role on Thursday. Walking a fine line Any windfall from bringing cash home, however, may come with strings attached. While companies may see buybacks and dividends as the obvious use for their overseas holdings, the Trump administration has different ideas: it is likely to push for tech groups to put their freed-up funds into hiring US workers. Internet companies may well find their day-to-day operations more difficult. The Snowden revelations of 2013 exposed the bulk surveillance carried out by US intelligence services and the extent towards which tech companies must co-operate. The leaks rocked trust in internet groups, but the new regime, which has made security a priority, could introduce measures that expand surveillance at the expense of privacy: Trump publicly criticised Apple over its refusal to decrypt an iPhone belonging to a dead terrorist last year. The tech industry is often accused of playing fast and loose on privacy. Appearing to collaborate with spooks could spark a mainstream backlash. Of all of Silicon Valley's famous names, the one that might have the most to gain from Donald Trump's presidency is Twitter, from which the president fires off constant missives. "It's definitely been fascinating to learn from," Twitter's founder Jack Dorsey said at a recent conference. But when asked about how he feels about the new leader of the free world, one word summed it up: "Complicated". - Daily Telegraph UK Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Have your say 1200 characters left By and large our readers' comments are respectful and courteous.

Corazon Victorino International Business TimesFebruary 5, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share If this new report is to be believed, the Google Now launcher is disappearing from the Play Store next month.More If you’re the type to go for the minimalist Android launcher, then it’s possible that you may have used or is still using the Google Now launcher. Its easy-to-navigate interface and its minimalist design are two things that make it an instant favorite of many Android consumers. Unfortunately, happy days will soon be over for Google Now launcher patrons because a recent leak is claiming that Google will be killing its popular launcher next month.  According to BGR, Google is removing the Google Now launcher from the Play Store on March 1. The removal of the app would also signal the end of support for it. Thus, no more major updates are coming to devices still running it. No new devices are also shipping with this launcher straight out of the box.  The claim that Google is terminating its famous launcher comes from a leaked email to Android device manufacturers that was obtained by Android Police on Friday. Explaining why its the end of the road for its Now launcher, Google indicated that the new Search Launcher Services is going to duplicate the features of Google Now. This means device manufacturers will soon have the capacity to create their own launchers with features from Google Now.  Despite its decision to discontinue Google Now, Google stated in the email that it is willing to continue supporting existing users of the launcher by updating the Google Search app. Nevertheless, users will henceforth be incapable of downloading and installing the Google Now launcher from the Play Store.  The Google Now launcher is a unique app for it controls the home screen and it also brings extra functions to the table. It serves as a good contrast to Samsung and LG”s bloatware, for it just comes with a clean and clutter-free interface. Terminating it could simply mean that Google is setting its sights on making the Pixel Launcher public or available to everyone, as per MobiPicker.  Related Articles Google Assistant Coming To Nexus 5X, 6P Google Chrome For iOS Now Lets You Scan QR Codes Without Using Another App Android 7.0 Nougat Samsung Galaxy S7 Release Date: T-Mobile Now Testing Google Software    Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next A guide to tonight's comet-eclipse-full-moon triple feature CNET Whatever Makes You Feel Beautiful WalgreensSponsored Wristband monitors your blood alcohol content while you drink Yahoo Tech Your first look at 'Avengers: Infinity War' CNET The White House employee who ensures Trump doesn’t get hacked has been fired BGR News Unlimited Data Talk and Text Sprint®Sponsored Target’s big Apple Watch sale is still happening right now BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

Enlarge Image It's a genius at helping you do nothing. Google/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET On Sunday, most of America sits, eats, drinks, stares, eats, drinks, shouts, eats, drinks and debates the merits of contemporary advertising. With perfect grace, therefore, Google's Super Bowl ad strives to show how much the company understands the sheer slovenly laziness of the contemporary American. The ad celebrates Google Home, the company's attempt to send Alexa up the Amazon. Here we see the sheer glory of being able to say "OK Google" and turn on the lights at home. Yes, even when you have two free hands to do it yourself. Google Home will also turn up the music while you're dishing out food. How does it know how much to turn up the music? Oh, Google knows everything about you, apparently.

Quartz’s reviews Written by Chase Purdy Obsession Machines with Brains February 05, 2017 Living in tech. (Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) Share Written by Chase Purdy Obsession Machines with Brains February 05, 2017 Google Home arrived in the US months ago, but a Super Bowl commercial for the voice-activated home assistant is serving as a new introduction of the product to millions of American television viewers. It’s a fairly political ad, too. In the one-minute spot, the omnipresent tech firm highlights how Google Home can fit the everyday lives of people across America—no matter their race, religion, gender, or ethnic background. It’s an obvious attempt to strike at the theme of connectivity during a time when the political climate around diversity has reached a fever pitch. Aside from politics, though, just how good a product is the Google Home, and how does it stack against its chief competitor, the Amazon Echo? Quartz reporters spent some time with Google Home and the Echo, here’s what they found: Google Home It’s powered by the Google search engine, so it’s really good at answering questions. Beware, though, users have to precede every question with the phrase, “OK, Google.” (This can get tiresome, though it’s arguably kinder than the alternative.) The speaker quality is solid, it’s easy to set up, and it can sync with other home devices made by Google (like Nest and Chromecast), along with Philips Hue lights, and Samsung SmartThings. The negatives: It can be a little slow in answering questions, and its responses are sometimes a little wordy. (Sample from Mike Murphy’s review in Quartz: “If you ask it for the weather where you are, it’ll tell you ‘Right now in Astoria, New York 11102, it’s currently 73 and mostly cloudy. It’ll be partly cloudy today with a forecasted high of 73 and a low of 52.’” Still, if you’re in the market for an a voice-activated home assistant, the Google Home is a solid choice. Just know that your $130 is going toward technology that’s still nascent and has a lot of room for improvement. (You can find Quartz’s complete review here.) Amazon Echo The Echo has been around a bit longer than Google Home—Amazon debuted it in 2014—so it’s already had it’s own Super Bowl commercial. Here the one that ran in 2016: And here is what Quartz had to say about the Echo back then. The natural question for people interested in this $180 product is how it has improved since. It’s been lambasted as a “glorified radio clock,” but the Echo has its selling points, too. It can order you an Uber, help you shop for things on Amazon, and, like Google Home, can sync with Spotify. But for general queries, it’s less adept with conversation. Product reviews show people generally love it or are frustrated by its limitations, which range from not listening well for ambient voice commands to not being portable. At the end of the day… No matter which home assistant you choose, one thing was pretty clear to Quartz’s reviewers: These products are essentially middlemen that massive tech companies are using to get people to spend more money with them. The Echo, for example, will gladly steer you into purchasing more items from Amazon and its vast network of retailers. And Google Home will happily connect you to YouTube Red pay subscriptions, and songs and films from Google Play Music. Oh, and as always, these products vacuum up as much data about their users as possible. Still, they’re pretty cool to play with.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Feb 5, 2017 at 1:20PM Last week, Brand Finance came out with its annual listing of brand valuations. In a somewhat shocking finding, the consulting group declared that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had lost its supremacy to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. Alphabet is a phenomenal company with a long track record of innovation, and the Google brand is extremely powerful. Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same league as Apple's brand in terms of total value. Is Apple turning sour? While Brand Finance still rates Apple as the second most valuable brand in the world, it appears to have a fairly negative view of the iPhone maker. According to the recent report: However, Apple's evangelists are beginning to lose their faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected. Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with traditional rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), but a slew of Chinese brands such as Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple's key source of profitability. As a result of this assessment, Brand Finance reduced its estimate of the Apple brand's value by 27% year over year, to $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estimated Google's brand value at $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand Finance cited Google's dominance in search, among other things, to justify the big increase in its brand value. Consumers are paying more and more for iPhones Brand Finance's declining opinion of the Apple brand is contradicted by consumers' willingness to pay more and more for iPhones. Last quarter, Apple reported record quarterly iPhone sales of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the average selling price (ASP) reached a new record of $695. The iPhone's ASP hit a new record last quarter. Image source: Apple. In the same quarter two years ago, right after Apple released the hugely popular iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the iPhone's ASP had surged 8% year over year, to $687. Apple's ability to continue growing that ASP over the past two years, despite facing stiff foreign exchange headwinds in both years, is a testament to the massive value of its brand. Indeed, the cost of high-quality smartphones is coming down. Leaving aside Samsung, several Chinese manufacturers have become known for designing high-quality smartphones and selling them at near-breakeven prices in recent years. Apple's ability to command a huge price premium over competitors -- which extends beyond smartphones to PCs and (to a lesser extent) tablets -- indicates that its brand is as strong as ever. Apple is a profit machine According to Brand Finance, Apple has failed to maintain a technological lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, many tech pundits have argued in recent years that Samsung has overtaken Apple in terms of innovation. Assuming that the two companies are on a relatively even technological footing, they should be able to produce roughly similar earnings. However, that's not even close to being true. Last quarter, Apple barely retook the lead in terms of smartphone shipments with 78.3 million, compared to 77.5 million shipments for Samsung, according to Strategy Analytics. Yet Samsung's mobile-division operating profit totaled just $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple's operating profit was more than 10 times higher at $23.4 billion. On a full-year basis -- or looking just at the smartphone business -- Apple's advantage is somewhat smaller. But any way you slice it, Apple generates many times more profit than Samsung. (In its most recent fiscal year, Apple's operating profit was $60 billion, compared to about $10 billion for Samsung's mobile division.) If Apple doesn't have superior technology relative to Samsung, its brand must be doing most of the heavy lifting to generate $50 billion of additional operating profit on an annual basis. That's more than double Alphabet's total annual operating profit of $23.7 billion. Google may be a powerful brand. However, it doesn't come close to the value of the Apple brand, which has turned the traditionally low-margin technology hardware business into a long-term cash cow that churns out tens of billions of dollars of profit every year.

Photo / AP One of my favorite sayings is 'Ask Mr. G'... Google that is. Because of the vast amount of data - thus artificial intelligence that Google has acquired, it has answers to EVERYTHING. Want tomorrows forecast? Ask Mr G. Looking for a new restaurant? Ask Mr G. What is the meaning of life? Yup, Mr G knows. However Google offers much more than just searches. He will calculate, convert, research and do much more for you. Here are some great Google secret shortcuts that are right within the address bar to save you time. 1. Calculations No need to open a calculator app or webpage: simply type in an equation in the search bar and Google will immediately show the result in the search suggestions. This works in Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, and Firefox, but not Safari. You can search "Tip Calculator" to quickly work out how much of a tip you should leave behind, or "unit converter" to work out conversions such as Litre's to Milliliters. 2. Travel and City Information Google has smart search features for travelers and those interested in what's going on in other places. You can search for flight information by typing in a flight number to see its ETA, look for things to do over the next few days (for example, search "Auckland events"). Want help planning an upcoming trip? Type "destination" or "vacation" after the location you're planning to visit (such as "Spain" or "Fiji") and Google will offer popular itineraries, weather reports, airfares, hotel price comparisons, and more. 3. Nutrition Quickly access the nutritional value of a food item by searching the 'foods name' plus 'nutritional facts'. For example I searched M&Ms nutritional facts and it promptly showed me that 15 M&Ms contain 52 calories, 2 grams of fat and other information. Continued below. Related Content Two Kiwis wealthier than the poorest 30 % - Oxfam Tinder and dating apps blamed for rampant rates of sexual promiscuity You, memes and Harambe 4. Timer or stopwatch Enter "stopwatch" to use a stopwatch in the Google Search or search for "set time for 5 minutes" to automatically start a timer. 5. Entertainment Google "fun facts" to learn random trivia or search for "animal sounds" for something that might amuse your kids. 6. Drag and Drop to Search If you don't feel like typing (or like me, have a terrible memory), highlight, then drag and drop text into the Google search bar from other windows or documents. 7. Google Search Operators Search operators are characters that narrow down your search query to get more specific results. You can tell Google, for example, to omit certain words from the results or to find pages that are similar to another. A list of Google search operators can be found here. One of my favourites is OR. An example being Hotel OR Motel - it will include both in the search results. Another favourite is NOT for exclusion.

The buyer? Planet Labs. Though, the Monsanto-owned firm Climate Corporation was also in talks with the company previously, according to the sources in question — a matter we’ll return to further down. Why does this matter to us here at CleanTechnica? Amongst other reasons, Alphabet/Google originally acquired the business in 2014 (for $500 million) partly in order to get access to better mapping data for Google Maps (which has relevance for the Google/Waymo self-driving vehicle tech business). There also also potential connections to climate change, climate mitigation, and climate adaptation. As part of a general restructuring over the last year, though, it seems that Alphabet is no longer keen to hold onto the business — for whatever reasons. Tech Crunch provides more context not included in the Planet Labs announcement (and published before the Planet Labs announcement): “The transaction, one source said, is ‘essentially already done’ and will involve employees as well as satellite assets. We’ve not heard a firm price. Aside from the $300 million figure we heard, another described Terra Bella as essentially being ‘donated’ to Planet. … “Planet Labs has raised just under $160 million to date from investors including Yuri Milner, Founders Fund, and Data Collective, and it has positioned itself as a consolidator of sorts in the small satellite space. In 2015, the company acquired Blackbridge, another player in small satellites. “If the valuation of Terra Bella is anything close to what Google paid for it, Planet might have to raise more capital — or, what may be more likely according to a source — acquire the assets in an equity deal, where Google could take a stake in Planet.” That could make a lot of sense — after all, the company would still have an easy means of getting the mapping data it wants, but without having to directly run yet another business/division. Notably, Google originally considered purchasing Planet Labs, according to rumors. However, there is no mention of equity for Google in the initial announcement, only that it will be a multi-year customer. Here’s a bit more from that Tech Crunch coverage that’s particularly interesting: “But even if Google is bowing out of the race to control better mapping data for enterprise applications, there are others still hot on the trail. ‘Climate is talking to every single micro-satellite company in the valley,’ one source told us about the Monsanto-owned digital agricultural company. “The Climate Corporation provides tools and a platform to measure and model weather, soil, and field data to farmers to optimize their crop production. Getting a more direct source of imaging data, and more control of what is actually getting photographed and how, seems like a very logical strategy.” Hmm? That’s no doubt a vast simplification of what that sort of data could and likely would be used for. Back to the Planet Labs announcement, not much is detailed on what the actual deal with Google is, but the company writes, “Google, upon closing, will enter into a multi-year contract to purchase Earth-imaging data from Planet.” And here’s more on what Planet Labs thinks of and intends to do with the acquisition: “We’ve long admired what the team at Terra Bella has achieved and we think the SkySat constellation of 7 high resolution satellites is highly complementary to Planet’s existing medium resolution 60-satellite fleet. The former enable regular, rapidly updated snapshots of select areas of the globe at sub-meter resolution; the latter regular, global coverage at 3–5 meter resolution. The two systems under one roof will be truly unique and will enable valuable new capabilities. “Planet will distribute SkySat data through Planet’s suite of geospatial offerings. Planet’s global medium-resolution imagery has proven to be of great value in the commercial market, enabling us to exceed our revenue goals in 2016. With Terra Bella, Planet will diversify its available data and solutions and be able to serve new customers and markets.” Buy a cool T-shirt or mug in the CleanTechnica store!   Keep up to date with all the hottest cleantech news by subscribing to our (free) cleantech newsletter, or keep an eye on sector-specific news by getting our (also free) solar energy newsletter, electric vehicle newsletter, or wind energy newsletter.

So with a simple voice command or the touch of a button on our smartphones, we can set the temperature, turn on a light or prepare the TV to record a programme. What could go wrong? A lot more than most people are prepared for, it turns out. If one of these devices gets hijacked, hackers could potentially snoop around for sensitive data like financial or health information. Or they could use a network of compromised devices to perform a widespread attack that takes down major websites, which is what happened in October. The good news is that so far, online attacks on home devices are relatively uncommon. Only 10% of US consumers said they were victims of the crime in a recent study done for the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co. However, those who experienced such an attack through their home gadgets reported losses of $1,000 to $5,000 from the incidents. “There’s still this whole sort of, ‘Gee whiz, it’s so cool’ thing that’s going on” with Internet-connected home appliances, said Lee Tien, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights. “That’s also what often gets us into trouble.” As smart home devices become more popular, they will become bigger targets for hackers. So it behooves us to get ahead of the curve by securing our home appliances, using these tips from security experts who have closely studied smart home accessories. Research before you buy When shopping for an Internet-connected home device like a smart speaker, lighting system or television set, a good rule of thumb is to go with a trusted brand. Larger, well-regarded companies like Amazon or Google have a background in developing products with security in mind, said Liviu Arsene, an analyst for Bitdefender, which sells security hardware for protecting smart home accessories. Before buying a product, consumers should do a web search on it to see if the company regularly issues software updates that fix security vulnerabilities, he said. People should also carefully read company privacy policies. David Britton, a vice president in the fraud and identity department of Experian, the credit reporting agency, said people should be curious about whether companies themselves were a threat to user privacy. “What are they capturing about you?” he said. “Is the data leaving the device? Is it being sent back to the mother ship?” Consider the smart speakers from Amazon and Google. Amazon said its Alexa smart assistant, which is used in its Echo speakers, automatically downloads software updates to defend against new security threats. Data from the Echo is also uploaded to Amazon’s servers only after people utter the wake word “Alexa,” the company said. That minimises the likelihood that the device will record conversations unrelated to requests intended for Alexa. Google said its Home speaker similarly issued regular software updates and employed advanced security features, like a technique that disables the device if its software is tampered with. The company added that the speaker processed speech only after the words “OK Google” or “Hey Google” were detected. But other large brands occasionally engage in behaviour that customers may find objectionable. The smart TV maker Vizio, for example, made headlines with revelations from the investigative news site ProPublica that it kept a detailed record of customer viewing habits and shared it with advertisers, who could then use the information to identify other devices you owned. Strengthen your Wi-Fi security Your Wi-Fi network is the pulse of your smart home, thus it is a vulnerable attack point. Britton and Arsene suggest connecting all your smart home accessories — for example, your Amazon Echo, Nest thermostat, Samsung smart refrigerator and Philips Hue smart lights — onto a Wi-Fi network that is separate from the one connected to your computing devices, like your smartphone, tablet and computer. With two distinct Wi-Fi networks, it will be harder for a hacker to jump from infiltrating your smart accessory on one network to a personal computer on the other network, Arsene said. The easiest way to create a second Wi-Fi network is to make a guest network. Many modern Wi-Fi routers, like TP-Link’s Archer C7, include the ability to host a network for guests that uses a name and password different from that of your primary network. Quarantining your smart speakers, lights and TV onto a guest network will allow them all to interact with one another, while keeping your computing devices safer in the event that any of the smart accessories are hacked. If you are paranoid about your Wi-Fi network being hacked, you can also change the Wi-Fi router’s network settings to disable broadcasting the network name entirely, Britton said. That would make it difficult for a hacker driving by to detect and compromise your network, though it would also require house guests to manually type in your network name and password when they log on to your Wi-Fi. Beef up your wimpy passwords The same security principles for websites apply to the so-called IoT. You should set strong, unique passwords for logging into each device you own. If you recycle your passwords and one device is compromised, the others can be, too. A strong password can be a random string of characters or a nonsensical phrase with numbers and special characters. If you cannot memorise your passwords, that is a good thing: That means they are hard for hackers to crack. Keep them written down on a piece of paper and stored in a safe place, or store your passwords in a password-managing app like 1Password or LastPass. Regularly audit appliances for updates While reputable manufacturers of smart home accessories offer software updates to patch security vulnerabilities, it is often up to the consumer to stay on top of updates. Because it lacks a screen, a smart light bulb or an Internet-connected power socket is going to have a tough time informing you that it needs a software update. Britton and Arsene recommend that consumers regularly log into the mobile apps or websites for their smart home accessories to check if they need software updates. If updates are available, install them immediately. When in doubt, hit mute Among security researchers, putting a piece of tape over a computer webcam has become a tongue-in-cheek recommendation for those who are extra paranoid about their privacy. (Even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, does it.) With smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, there is an equivalent: a mute button to disable the device microphone so it can no longer listen. In the unlikely event that a device is hijacked, muting the microphone could help prevent hackers from listening to your conversations, Britton said. Or you could go the safest route and opt out of having these devices at all.   Tweet Go to Top Videos 'PM Modi likes peeping into others' bathroom':... Massive fire breaks out in Tata Cancer...

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Feb 5, 2017 at 1:20PM Last week, Brand Finance came out with its annual listing of brand valuations. In a somewhat shocking finding, the consulting group declared that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had lost its supremacy to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. Alphabet is a phenomenal company with a long track record of innovation, and the Google brand is extremely powerful. Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same league as Apple's brand in terms of total value. Is Apple turning sour? While Brand Finance still rates Apple as the second most valuable brand in the world, it appears to have a fairly negative view of the iPhone maker. According to the recent report: However, Apple's evangelists are beginning to lose their faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected. Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with traditional rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), but a slew of Chinese brands such as Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple's key source of profitability. As a result of this assessment, Brand Finance reduced its estimate of the Apple brand's value by 27% year over year, to $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estimated Google's brand value at $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand Finance cited Google's dominance in search, among other things, to justify the big increase in its brand value. Consumers are paying more and more for iPhones Brand Finance's declining opinion of the Apple brand is contradicted by consumers' willingness to pay more and more for iPhones. Last quarter, Apple reported record quarterly iPhone sales of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the average selling price (ASP) reached a new record of $695. The iPhone's ASP hit a new record last quarter. Image source: Apple. In the same quarter two years ago, right after Apple released the hugely popular iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the iPhone's ASP had surged 8% year over year, to $687. Apple's ability to continue growing that ASP over the past two years, despite facing stiff foreign exchange headwinds in both years, is a testament to the massive value of its brand. Indeed, the cost of high-quality smartphones is coming down. Leaving aside Samsung, several Chinese manufacturers have become known for designing high-quality smartphones and selling them at near-breakeven prices in recent years. Apple's ability to command a huge price premium over competitors -- which extends beyond smartphones to PCs and (to a lesser extent) tablets -- indicates that its brand is as strong as ever. Apple is a profit machine According to Brand Finance, Apple has failed to maintain a technological lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, many tech pundits have argued in recent years that Samsung has overtaken Apple in terms of innovation. Assuming that the two companies are on a relatively even technological footing, they should be able to produce roughly similar earnings. However, that's not even close to being true. Last quarter, Apple barely retook the lead in terms of smartphone shipments with 78.3 million, compared to 77.5 million shipments for Samsung, according to Strategy Analytics. Yet Samsung's mobile-division operating profit totaled just $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple's operating profit was more than 10 times higher at $23.4 billion. On a full-year basis -- or looking just at the smartphone business -- Apple's advantage is somewhat smaller. But any way you slice it, Apple generates many times more profit than Samsung. (In its most recent fiscal year, Apple's operating profit was $60 billion, compared to about $10 billion for Samsung's mobile division.) If Apple doesn't have superior technology relative to Samsung, its brand must be doing most of the heavy lifting to generate $50 billion of additional operating profit on an annual basis. That's more than double Alphabet's total annual operating profit of $23.7 billion. Google may be a powerful brand. However, it doesn't come close to the value of the Apple brand, which has turned the traditionally low-margin technology hardware business into a long-term cash cow that churns out tens of billions of dollars of profit every year.

LG Watch Sport Smartwatch Spotted in Benchmark GO It will be announced on February 8 and it will cost $350 Feb 5, 2017 18:28 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Google has confirmed it will release Android Wear 2.0 in early February, but it did not mention any date for the announcement. Although previous reports suggested the new OS would be unveiled on February 9, it looks like Google has decided to change the Android Wear 2.0 release date. As mentioned in our previous report, Google is now said to launch Android Wear 2.0 on February 8, one day earlier than expected. Besides the new platform, the Mountain View company is likely to introduce two new smartwatches as well, the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style. We've already reported about both Google's smartwatches built by LG, but this is the first time that we have information that confirms some of their specs. Before going into details, it's worth mentioning that LG Watch Sport will cost $350, while LG Watch Style's price won't surpass the $250 mark. These are leaked prices that haven't been confirmed by Google yet, but considering they come from a reliable source, we expect them to be accurate. LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style Moving on to the actual specs, the LG Watch Sport, the most expensive of the two, has been recently spotted on Geekbench, a benchmark database that stores performance results. According to the listing at Geekbench, the LG Watch Sport will be powered by an unnamed 1.09GHz quad-core processor, coupled with 768MB RAM. The listing also confirms the “Swordfish” code name of the smartwatch. Although the wearable device is listed with Android 7.1.1 Nougat on board, LG Watch Sport will actually ship with Android Wear 2.0 operating system right out of the box. Based on previous reports, we also know the smartwatch will pack 4GB of storage and a decent 430 mAh battery, which should allow for one day of average usage. Also, the LG Watch Sport will feature IP68 certification, so it's supposed to be dust and water resistant.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Android Wear 2.0#LG Watch Sport#LG Watch Style#Google smartwatch#LG smartwatch subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Android Wear 2.0 and Google's Smartwatches to Be Announced on February 8 LG Watch Sport and Watch Style Prices Revealed Ahead of Launch Leaked Images of LG Watch Style Reveal Stunning Design and Colors Google's Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches Leaked in Low-Res Renders Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One 2 photos    LG Watch Sport benchmark results new android apps HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Normally Google would not bother announcing such a thing, but in this case it made an exception because of the impact this could have users who are still clinging to Windows XP and Windows Vista. The last supported version of Chrome on either OS was Chrome 49. "As previously announced in April 2015 and November 2015, these systems are no longer maintained by Microsoft, and we strongly encourage you to migrate to more secure and supported systems," Google said. This announcement does not necessarily mean that Gmail will stop working altogether for staunch holdouts of Windows XP and Windows Vista. The first thing that will happen is Google will put a banner at the top of the Gmail interface for users who are still on Chrome 53 or earlier. This banner will encourage upgrading to the latest version of Chrome, which is currently Chrome 55. Those who ignore the banner's advice will still be able to use Gmail through the end of 2017. After that, Google will stop dishing out updates, which means affected users will be more vulnerable to security holes and will miss out any new features and bug fixes. Google is planning to redirect affected users to the basic HTML version of Gmail. This could happen as early as December 2017. "If you manage Chrome Browser for your users, we strongly encourage you to update users to the latest version of Chrome. Depending on what operating system your users are on, you may need to migrate them to a supported system to get the latest version and features," Google added. Around 9 percent of desktop systems are still running Windows XP. Windows Vista accounts for slightly less than 1 percent, though if you combine the two, then one of every 10 PCs is potentially affected by this announcement. The actual number won't be quite as high since it's not likely that every single Windows XP and Windows Vista user also uses Gmail and Chrome.

Google will then start buying satellite images from Planet Labs after signing a multi-year contract. Planet Labs spokesman Will Marshall delivered a statement, expressing the company-wide excitement for acquiring one of Google’s most useful branches for the digital imaging of Earth, alongside a high-resolution satellite array that will add 7 new pieces to Planet Labs’ 60-satellite fleet, capable of achieving medium-resolution captures.

Google’s satellites allow for a sub-meter resolution, while Planet Labs current devices cover a resolution of 3 to 5 meters. Image credit: Terra Bella. A company to image the whole planet Planet Labs has already been able to profit greatly from its medium-resolution imagery, as they reported a surplus on their revenue goals for 2016. Planet Labs started in 2013 with just one satellite, and now they have dozens more, all directed toward the objective of “image the entire Earth every day.” Terra Bella scientists will join Planet Labs, and Google will continue working as a close commercial and technological ally. According to Jen Fitzpatrick, Google’s Vice-president of Product and Engineering, Terra Bella is a match with Planet Labs, seeing that both companies have achieved great success in the past two years. Aix-en-Provence captured by a Terra Bella satellite on October 20, 2016. Image credit: Terra Bella Last Friday, Planet Labs announced to be planning the launching of 88 satellites, becoming the largest fleet of satellites ever launched in history. The launch will be staged in Sriharikota, India, aiming for a 500 km altitude. It is expected to take place on February 14. On the other hand, Terra Bella is how Google tackles the search for patterns of change in the physical world. The company claims that this would help to understand environmental and economic challenges by imaging world-scale trends and visible changes. Terra Bella’s website showcases how the company tackles its observation projects. Some include overseeing maritime supply lines to anticipate changes, delays, and other events in ports and docking stations. This could help measure global economic indicators, which would be valuable to hedge fund traders and market operators, allowing them to spot inefficiencies and bottlenecks.

There’s also the proposal to aid in emergency and disaster relief, where immediate satellite imagery can provide information to emergency responders, easing the task of assessing damage and providing assistance in natural disasters. A third project shows how Terra Bella monitors mining development in Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia. On the mine, high-resolution satellite imagery would create a record of how infrastructure changes and where is a higher degree of opportunity or risk. It would also allow construction companies to systematically track how their projects are taking place as they evolve in remote areas. The Oyu Tolgoi gold and copper ore mine in Mongolia is showcased on the page; it will become Mongolia’s most ambitious financial project. After its completion, the mine is expected to represent at least 30 percent of the country’s GDP.

Here’s why.More Sorry, but Google is terminating its Gmail support for some platforms this year. The Mountain View giant announced the bad news early this week alongside its call for users to upgrade their Chrome to the latest version of the browser.  On the G Suite Updates blog, the team behind the web-based e-mail service stated that Windows XP and Windows Vista users will be most affected by its move. Apparently, the dated Windows platforms only support Chrome browser v49 because XP and Vista are no longer maintained by Microsoft. The Redmond-based tech company announced back in 2015 that it was abandoning the two platforms.  Because Windows XP and Windows Vista only have support for v49 of Chrome, they will not be able to load or open the updated Gmail interface. Google’s browser is currently on version 55. The latest version has very important security updates and on top of that it is very different from v49. Thus, Google is encouraging users who are still using v53 and below to upgrade to v55 as soon as possible.  Google warns that users who will not update their browser to the latest version will be vulnerable to attacks. The security updates can prevent these attacks. Also, the latest version comes with new features and bug fixes. For people who will not be updating this year, they will still have access to Gmail. However, when December 2017 comes, they will only be able to load the basic HTML version of the service.  For Windows XP and Windows Vista users, Deccan Chronicle recommends upgrading to a newer operating system. Of course, if they wish to continue using the platforms, they can just rely on third-party browsers when accessing Gmail. However, the news site says there is no guarantee that these third-party browsers can keep the users’ Gmail account safe.  Google is serious in promoting Chrome browser v55. Hence, starting Feb. 8, users who have not updated their browser to the latest version will see a banner on top of their Gmail interface. The banner will be there to encourage and inform users of the need to upgrade to the up-to-date version of Chrome.  Related Articles Google Chrome For iOS Now Lets You Scan QR Codes Without Using Another App Google Sets Up $4 Million Immigration Crisis Fund After Trump Ban Android 7.0 Nougat Successor Taking Center Stage At Google I/O 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next A guide to tonight's comet-eclipse-full-moon triple feature CNET McKayla Maroney Looks Completely Unrecognizable AllRookieSponsored Wristband monitors your blood alcohol content while you drink Yahoo Tech Your first look at 'Avengers: Infinity War' CNET The White House employee who ensures Trump doesn’t get hacked has been fired BGR News Why Lil' Kim Isn't The Lil' Kim You Remember Trend ChaserSponsored Target’s big Apple Watch sale is still happening right now BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

Android Wear 2.0 and Google's Smartwatches to Be Announced on February 8 GO Luckily, the release date has been moved up a day Feb 5, 2017 16:44 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Google plans to push Android Wear 2.0 to as many customers as possible this year, as the search giant teamed up with many companies to release many smartwatches in the next couple of months. Moreover, the Mountain View company is expected to launch its own Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches, which will be built by LG: Watch Sport and Watch Style. According to previous rumors, Google was supposed to launch Android Wear 2.0, as well as the two smartwatches, on February 9. However, it appears that something happened and the search giant moved the release day up a day. Evan Blass claims Android Wear 2.0 and both the smartwatches will now be launched on February 8, one day earlier than previously expected. Obviously, that's great news for those who own smartwatches that have been confirmed to receive Android Wear 2.0 as an update soon after release. Here they are: Moto 360 Gen 2, Moto 360 Sport, LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, LG Watch Urbane, LG G Watch R, Polar M600, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch, Nixon Mission, Tag Heuer Connected, Fossil Q Wander, Fossil Q Marshal, Fossil Q Founder, Michael Kors Access Bradshaw Smartwatch, Michael Kors Access Dylan Smartwatch, Huawei Watch, Huawei Watch Ladies, Asus ZenWatch 2, and Asus ZenWatch 3. The first Android Wear smartwatches launched by Google Aside from Android Wear 2.0, Google and LG will also introduce their first smartwatches powered by the new platform: Watch Sport and Watch Style. They are rumored to go on sale the next day for $350 and $250, respectively. Both smartwatches have been confirmed to feature deep Google Assistant integration, along with IP68 and IP67 certifications for dust and water resistance. They also come with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functions, but the Watch Sport adds cellular connectivity (3G and LTE support), GPS and NFC (Near Field Communication) into the mix. Heart rate sensor, Android Pay support, untethered telephony support with the phone number of the user's main smartphone, as well as iOS compatibility, will be available too. #Android Wear 2.0#LG Watch Sport#LG Watch Style#LG smartwatch#Google smartwatch subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news LG Watch Sport and Watch Style Prices Revealed Ahead of Launch Leaked Images of LG Watch Style Reveal Stunning Design and Colors LG Watch Sport and Watch Style Are Google's First Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches Android Wear 2.0 to Supposedly Arrive on February 9 Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One    LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style new android apps HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments BlackBerry Releases New Teaser for Mercury Announcement Ahead of MWC more on: BlackBerry i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

(Photo: Getty) 32 CONNECTTWEET 19 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto, the “Main Street” of Silicon Valley, and you’ll easily hear seven or ten different languages spoken. Those speakers come from all over the world to launch companies, create jobs, invest in America. America has always attracted the best and the brightest, the most eager, from around the world. But Donald Trump’s recent travel ban threatens to silence those voices, divert those eager immigrants, reduce their economic impact. And that’s bad news for entrepreneurs and small businesses, whether in Silicon Valley or Sioux Falls. Why would a travel ban, limited to seven countries, threaten your small business? How could it stifle your entrepreneurial aspirations? Because Trump’s travel ban is likely to reduce immigration, inhibit foreign visitors, and make American business people less welcome abroad, all damaging the overall U.S. economy. “I’m here because I’m a refugee,” Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, was reported to have said when he was seen joining travel ban protestors at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday, January 28. Yes, Google, along with more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies, was founded by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant., according to the American Immigration Council. Those companies employ over 3.6 million Americans. In 2010, immigrant business owners were responsible for 15% of all business revenue in the U.S., $121.2 billion. Those companies, and their employees, have spawned a lot of new small businesses. Google itself company itself employs over 60,000 people, who in turn use the services of many small businesses.  Google is almost certainly the number advertising medium for small businesses. In your town or city, there are probably dozens, if not hundreds or thousands, of people who owe their business or job, directly or indirectly, to Google. USA TODAY Automakers go big with this year's Super Bowl ads That’s just one company founded by an immigrant. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' biological father was a Syrian refugee.  Imagine how much economic impact Apple and Pixar have had on America. Immigrants have had a similar impact in virtually every industry. Immigrants are driving new job creation in the U.S. Immigrants, start businesses at almost double the rate of non-immigrants, according to a 2012 Kauffman Foundation study. All over America, people owe their jobs or their businesses to immigrants. It’s likely that many of your customers and vendors are immigrants. As immigrants feel unwelcome and afraid, they stop coming, stop starting or funding businesses. And they stop spending. Trump’s impulsive, chaotic, manner is also unsettling to businesspeople. The thing everyone in business wants from politicians is neither right or left, Republican or Democrat. What they want, more than anything, is certainty. An impulsive, thoughtless president is more than worrisome. Through this travel ban, Trump is doing serious damage toward the goodwill Americans have enjoyed when doing business and traveling abroad. We are, almost overnight, seen as unreliable, capricious, narrow-minded. Small business owners in particular, understand that goodwill is critical to being able to do good business. That’s why business leaders – on the right and the left – Democrat and Republican -- have spoken out against Trump’s travel ban. It’s not surprising that in response to Trump’s travel ban and behavior, the stock market dropped. Perhaps most importantly, Trump’s travel ban, undermines the American values that help hold us together as a nation. We are a nation of immigrants, who welcome immigrants and celebrate immigrants. “On every level: moral, humanitarian, economic, logical,” tweeted Aaron Levie, CEO of document sharing company Box, “this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America.” Copyright, Rhonda Abrams, 2017 --------------- Rhonda Abrams is the author of “Entrepreneurship: A Real-World Approach,” just released in its second edition.  Connect with Rhonda facebook.com/RhondaAbramsSmallBusiness and twitter: @RhondaAbrams.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Feb 06, 2017 - Page 14　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Alphabet warns of rivals in digital assistants Bloomberg Alphabet Inc warned investors about a slew of new competitors, highlighting the company’s broad expansion beyond its original Google search business. Alphabet named rivals, including Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Hulu.com, while highlighting risks from new businesses, such as consumer hardware manufacturing, according to its latest annual report filed on Friday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Here are the top new competitive disclosures, gleaned from a comparison between Alphabet’s latest annual report and the filing from a year earlier: ‧ “Providers of digital video services, such as Facebook Inc, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.” Google’s YouTube has new paid subscription versions of its online video offering that compete more directly with the latter three companies. Executives were cautiously optimistic about this on an earnings call last week. “[It] takes a while to build a subscription business here,” chief financial officer Ruth Porat said. ‧ “Digital assistant providers, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft.” Last year, the company launched its Google Assistant, a voice-based information service that Google hopes to embed in as many devices as possible. That competes against Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana. Facebook has a similar service in its Messenger app. ‧ “Providers of enterprise cloud services, including Amazon and Microsoft.” This refers to Google’s cloud computing business, which executive Diane Greene is finally turning into a serious service for larger corporate customers. Alphabet mentioned the cloud in previous annual reports, but the focus on enterprise is new. ‧ “Companies that design, manufacture and market consumer electronics products.” This likely refers to Google’s new suite of gadgets, including the Pixel smartphone and Home speaker. The smartphone makes it a rival to Apple and Android device makers like Samsung Electronics Co. Alphabet’s latest annual report highlighted new manufacturing and supply-chain risks related to its in-house gadget push. “We may enter into long term contracts that commit us to significant terms and conditions of supply. We may be liable for material and product that is not consumed due to market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls and warranty issues,” the company wrote. Alphabet also disclosed the cost of marketing these new devices to potential buyers. Total sales and marketing expenses increased by more than US$1.4 billion from 2015 to last year — mainly due to a US$679 million jump in advertising and promotional costs for Google’s hardware products, the filing said.

The company wanted more time to polish the update before sending it out to the public. Recent reports have suggested that two new smartwatches that LG has made in collaboration with Google will also be released alongside Android Wear 2.0. A new report claims that the Android Wear 2.0 release will now take place earlier than previously suggested. It was previously reported that Android Wear 2.0 and the two LG smartwatches will be released on February 9th. LG was also said to give prominent placement to the new smartwatches at Mobile World Congress 2017 later this month. Infamous Twitter leakster @evleaks now claims that the LG Watch Style and Watch Sport smartwatches will be launched alongside Android Wear 2.0 on February 8th. Apparently the release has been moved up by one day for reasons not explained by the leakster. I should mention here that Google has not yet confirmed a release date for Android Wear 2.0 and LG hasn’t even acknowledged the existence of new smartwatches. It’s likely that an official announcement may be made soon considering the fact that February 8th is this Wednesday. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about Android Wear, Android Wear 2.0, Google.

Its easy-to-navigate interface and its minimalist design are two things that make it an instant favorite of many Android consumers. Unfortunately, happy days will soon be over for Google Now launcher patrons because a recent leak is claiming that Google will be killing its popular launcher next month.  According to BGR, Google is removing the Google Now launcher from the Play Store on March 1. The removal of the app would also signal the end of support for it. Thus, no more major updates are coming to devices still running it. No new devices are also shipping with this launcher straight out of the box.  The claim that Google is terminating its famous launcher comes from a leaked email to Android device manufacturers that was obtained by Android Police on Friday. Explaining why its the end of the road for its Now launcher, Google indicated that the new Search Launcher Services is going to duplicate the features of Google Now. This means device manufacturers will soon have the capacity to create their own launchers with features from Google Now.  Related Stories Google Assistant Coming To Nexus 5X, 6P Google Chrome For iOS Now Lets You Scan QR Codes Without Using Another App Android 7.0 Nougat Samsung Galaxy S7 Release Date: T-Mobile Now Testing Google Software    Despite its decision to discontinue Google Now, Google stated in the email that it is willing to continue supporting existing users of the launcher by updating the Google Search app. Nevertheless, users will henceforth be incapable of downloading and installing the Google Now launcher from the Play Store.  The Google Now launcher is a unique app for it controls the home screen and it also brings extra functions to the table. It serves as a good contrast to Samsung and LG”s bloatware, for it just comes with a clean and clutter-free interface. Terminating it could simply mean that Google is setting its sights on making the Pixel Launcher public or available to everyone, as per MobiPicker.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Our Paper Paper Archive Our Apps Daily Horoscope Home News Sport Showbiz & TV Life & Style Travel Tech Pics Casino Gaming Reviews Tech News Home Tech Tech News Samsung S7 edge Android Nougat UPDATE - Why this latest upgrade is already out of date Samsung S7 edge Android Nougat UPDATE - Why this latest upgrade is already out of date SOME Samsung Galaxy S7 users can now download Android Nougat but here's why this update is already obsolete. By Dave Snelling / Published 6th February 2017 Samsung Galaxy S8 - Leaked photos and concept images REVEALED Tuesday, 17th January 2017 SAMSUNG'S Galaxy S8 looks set to be unveiled in April and here's how it could look. 1 / 15 PH Samsung Galaxy S8 in pictures If you happen to own a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge smartphone it's likely you're patiently waiting for Android Nougat to arrive. Samsung starting pushing Nougat out to its devices a few weeks ago but many owners of the S7 and S7 Edge are still without this sweet upgrade. Owners of the S7 on contract appear to be facing a delay as tests need to be completed by the mobile networks. Testing is hugely important for operators as it gives them the chance to stop any bugs before the upgrade lands on devices. In a statement to Express.co.uk, an EE spokesperson said: "Like the majority of UK networks, we’re working with Samsung and hope to have an approved nougat O/S file to roll out to our Galaxy S7 customers shortly.” So, it appears that Nougat will be arriving soon but there’s still bad news for Galaxy owners. Just as this upgrade is being pushed out, Google has now begun testing an even newer version of Android. 7.1.2 Nougat can now be downloaded on Google’s own-brand devices, such the Pixel, but it's unlikely any other devices will see it anytime soon. According to an official blog post from Google, the new update includes a number of bug fixes and optimisations, along with a small number of enhancements for carriers and users. The latest beta is available today to those signed-up for the Android Beta Program. And things will get even more frustrating for Samsung fans in May when Google reveals its next-generation operating system which is likely to be nicknamed Android O. PH COMING SOON: Android Nougat is beginning to roll out on Samsung Galaxy S7 devices Google has just announced its 11th I/O developer conference will take place in the Spring and is expected to be packed with news. Last year Google announced Android Nougat during the event and this year should see the unveiling of Android 'O'. This means, as many Samsung users are just upgrading to Nougat, their operating system will instantly be out of date. Android upgrades have always caused problems for users as there are so many different manufacturers that make these devices. Each one of these companies has its own engineers, unique skins, apps and launchers that must become compliant with the newest version of Android. It takes time for firms such as Samsung, LG and HTC to test Google's latest release before it can pushed out to customers. Unless you have a Google-branded phone, such as the Pixel, you're unlikely to the see announcements made in May land on your phone until 2018.

By Sarmistha Acharya February 5, 2017 15:31 GMT Google has been ordered transferring emails from foreign server Reuters/Stephen Lam Google has been ordered to comply with search warrants for customer emails stored outside the US. The US magistrate judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday (3 February) the transfer of emails from a foreign server to the FBI for the law enforcement agency to review. According to a Reuters' report the judge said there was "no meaningful interference" with the account holder's "possessory interest" in the data sought. "Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States," noted Rueter. Google in a statement on Saturday said: "The magistrate, in this case, departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants." Google, in the court papers, said it breaks up emails into pieces to improve the performance of its network and did not know where exactly the particular emails might be stored. Google said it had complied with the warrants, by turning over data that was stored in the US. Rueter ruling suggests Google received more than 25,000 requests annually from the US authorities for the disclosure of user data related to criminal matters. The ruling by Reuter came just less than seven months after the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeal in New York ruled that American investigators could not force Microsoft to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin in a case related to narcotics. On 24 January, the appeals court voted against revisiting the ruling. Four judges have called on the US Supreme Court or Congress to reverse this legal decision, claiming the ruling hurts law enforcement.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS 5 predictions about Alexa, Cortana, and other AI assistants Khari Johnson@kharijohnson February 5, 2017 7:15 AM Tags: AI assistant, Alexa, Amazon, BotBeat Weekly, Google, Google Assistant, intelligent assistant, top-stories, virtual assistant, VoiceLabs Above: Alexa and Google Assistant-enabled devices Image Credit: David McCabe The 2017 Voice Report is a look ahead at what to expect in the coming chat wars between companies like Microsoft, Samsung, Google, and Amazon. It’s also a survey of Google Assistant and Alexa users, and a look into why some startups make more successful Alexa skills than others. The report was put together by VoiceLabs, a voice analytics startup tapped by Google for the launch of its Actions on Google, a platform for the creation of Google Assistant actions. VoiceLabs works with developers making Google Assistant actions and Alexa skills. The company was created last year by Alexandre Linares and Adam Marchick shortly after Marchick stepped down as CEO of mobile marketing company Kahuna, which he cofounded in 2012. Combined, VoiceLabs customers serve more than a million people using devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home, Marchick told VentureBeat in a phone interview. Here are 5 of the most interesting predictions from the 2017 Voice Report. 1. The next nine months will be incredibly important for the economic ecosystem emerging around intelligent assistants Many consumers have not yet definitively decided which intelligent assistant they like best, but they have decided they aren’t interested in buying multiple AI-powered assistants. In its December 2016 survey of Amazon Echo and Google Home devices, VoiceLabs found that only 11 percent would be willing to buy a Google Home after buying an Amazon Echo and vice versa. “What that means is that for the next nine months, it’s a winner-takes-entire-household market where whatever first device you buy in the home, there’s a good chance you’re going to stay loyal to that platform and buy more of that same platform,” Marchick told VentureBeat in a phone interview. “You’ll buy four Echo Dots to go with the Echo, so it makes getting devices out there in the next nine months critical.” “It’s also an alarm bell to Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, that they’ve got to join the party, and they’ve got to do it quickly,” he said. 2. Push notifications and social connection will be the Pokémon Go of intelligent assistants There are no breakout hits at the moment among the more than 8,000 Alexa skills and approximately 75 Google Assistant conversation actions, no killer app to be found. “Right now the closest thing we have to Pokémon Go is Spotify and Amazon Music,” Marchick said. Consistent with other studies, VoiceLabs found that about 45 percent of people surveyed use their smart speaker to play music or books more than for any other purpose. In order to make the creation of a killer bot possible, Marchick says developers need the ability to send push notifications and to connect with their personal social network. He predicts that both of these functions may emerge in 2017. Targeting activity based on activity by friends in your social network may lead to an increase in skill adoption. “It’s going to be like ’15 of your friends are talking right now. Do you want to join them?’ or ’20 of your friends just installed Pokémon Go. Do you want to be left out or not?'” Marchick said. Instead of a never-ending list of notifications, expect three or four highly valuable, proactive notifications each day, based on activity. Unfortunately, Marchick expects push notifications for voice-enabled devices to be a lot like those on mobile devices, at least at first. “First there’s going to be the capability of a push notification, and it will probably be abused, and then it will get cracked down on, and then they’ll realize that you’ve got to do this intelligently,” he said. 3. The number of devices sold will quadruple VoiceLabs estimates that 6.5 million voice-enabled devices were sold in 2015 and 2016, and that 24.5 million will be sold throughout 2017. This will bring overall sales to 33 million since 2014. VoiceLabs arrived at that number by combining estimates of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) devices sold with receipt tracking by InfoScout and KPCB research. “We got a growth curve for 2016, and we used that growth curve to project out to 2017, and that’s how we got 24.5 [million] in our full report,” Marchick said. In Amazon’s case at least, many of these sales may not take place until the end of the year. Quarterly sales announced Thursday said Alexa sales were highest during the holiday season, which have proven to be its best days of the year for sales. 4. Intelligent assistant makers will battle to ‘own the night’ Intelligent assistants do a pretty good job of owning the morning already by serving up flash news briefings and control of Internet of Things devices to turn on the lights, lift the blinds, and start the coffee maker. What’s important — and a battle still being waged in these chat wars — is owning the night. So what does that mean? It means making the best services for connection to devices like Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Chromecast. It also means adding a new functionality. “Direct person-to-person communication is a capability that doesn’t exist yet for both of these devices, but once you can just talk to your family and suddenly everyone is instantly connected … it’s just like really seamless and delightful,” Marchick said. 5. Tech giants will release two new smart speakers by the end of year We all know about Alexa and Google Home. We also know that Apple is thinking of making a competitor and that Cortana will be available soon in myriad devices. VoiceLabs believes that by the end of 2017, two new popular devices with intelligent assistants inside will emerge to compete with the Echo and Home, likely from Samsung, Apple, or Microsoft. Whether or not four turns out to be the magic number, intelligent assistants from Microsoft and the like are on the way. A Cortana skills kit is scheduled to be released in early 2017, while Samsung, following the acquisition of Viv, plans to roll out its new Samsung Galaxy S8 with assistant Bixby on March 29. Cortana, Google Assistant, and Alexa are making their way into more cars and appliances, so even if there is no epic battle between four smart speakers with an intelligent assistant inside, you can absolutely expect to find them in many devices other than smart speakers.

Nexus 6P vs Nexus 5X: The End of An EPIC Era... Vs Michael Grothaus 15:11, 5 Feb 2017 facebook twitter google+ Looking back at the excellent Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P – both of which now have Android Nougat! Android N is now available to ALL Nexus handsets, following its official unveiling at Google I/O 2016 alongside a bunch of other announcements which included HUGE updates to Google’s plans for the car industry, a new smart-home device called Google Home and a brand new VR platform called Daydream that will ship inside Android N. But Google’s Nexus phones are no more. They have now been replaced by the Google Pixel and the Google Pixel XL – two phones that are essentially Google’s version of the iPhone for the Android space. The decision by Google to nix its Nexus line and focus on selling premium, high-end phones designed within its HQ has been scrutinised to hell and back since the phones were first announced. I was skeptical too… but then I tested the Pixel XL out and it quite literally blew my mind. The handset has an amazing camera, brilliant performance and, best of all, perhaps the best battery life of ANY phone I have ever tested. Nothing can slow this handset down; heavy use yields a solid day and half, while more moderate usage will likely see things progress to two days. Standby is off the charts. Yes, these handsets are expensive. But so too is the iPhone, and this is the market – and consumers – Google is going after. It might take a few years for Google to catch up with Apple, but the quality of these Pixel handsets CANNOT be faulted. As phones they are easily two of the finest specimens ever produced by anyone in the mobile space. Still, if you want still want a Nexus you’re good to go, as the handsets are still available. We’ve even included some deals within this article for the best prices we found online. I still have a Nexus 6P and I still use it from time to time. It works great and will get support for Google for at least another 12 months and once that support runs out it will live on with custom ROMs, so, yes, the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, while no longer Google’s darlings, are still very much worthy of investment. For now though, let's have a look and see how Google's latest Nexus handsets compare. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Specs Here’s the specs for the Nexus 5X: Display: 5.2 inches, FHD (1920 x 1080) LCD at 423 ppi Dimensions: 147.0 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm Weight: 136 grams Storage: 16GB or 32GB Memory: 2 GB LPDDR3 Processors: Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, 1.8 GHz hexa-core 64-bit, Adreno 418 GPU Front camera: 5 MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture Rear camera: 12.3 MP, 1.55 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture, 4K video Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 MIMO, dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz); Bluetooth 4.2; NFC; GPS, GLONASS Colors: Carbon, Quartz, and Ice And here’s the specs for the Nexus 6P: Display: 5.7 inches; WQHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display at 518 ppi Dimensions: 159.3 X 77.8 X 7.3 mm Weight: 178 grams Storage: 32GB, 64 GB, or 128GB Memory: 3GB LPDDR4 Processors: Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 2.0 GHz Octa-core 64-bit; Adreno 430 GPU Front camera: 8MP camera; 1.4 µm pixels; f/2.4 aperture Rear camera: 12.3 MP; 1.55 µm pixels; f/2.0 aperture, 4K video Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 MIMO, dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz); Bluetooth 4.2; NFC; GPS, GLONASS Colors: Aluminium, Graphite, Frost, and Gold (Japan only) There’s no question about it, the Nexus 6P is clearly the better of the two phones from an internal spec point of view. It packs the excellent Snapdragon 810 processor and Adreno 430 GPU along with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM. It also comes in three storage sizes starting with a respectable 32GB (hey Apple, take note) and includes 64GB and 128GB options. That’s not to say the Nexus 5X is a slouch–it’s a great upgrade over the Nexus 5, but it’s a less premium phone and it shows in comparison with the slower Snapdragon 808 processor and Adreno 418 GPU and only 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Plus it only comes in 16GB and 32GB storage options–and no one should buy a 16GB phone; it’s just not enough space. With specs Google has pretty much hit the nail on the head. It has everything you could possibly want and need on both variants but, unlike it did with the Nexus 6, Google has presented another option for consumers that are looking for more value for money. But how do the handsets' differ with respect to performance? Let's dig a little deeper with some analysis of benchmarks that compare the two handsets in question as well as the newer HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE.  The Nexus 6P is the premium handset. It’s the one Google wants you to buy — the Nexus 6P is bigger, more expensive and decked out with better hardware. But what does this look like inside benchmarks? Is the gap as palpable as the price and marketing would have you believe? Let’s take a look. In Peacekeeper, which is a browser test, the handsets are very evenly matched. But when you consider both use Chrome as their stock web browser, this outcome isn’t surprising at all. This trend is also visible with the Galaxy S7 and HTC 10, which also use the same Android Marshmallow-version of Chrome. Where things start to get different is inside GFX, which puts the handsets’ through intensive graphics performance analysis with game-like content, low-level tests measure specific graphics performance aspects (Driver Overhead 2, ALU 2, Tessellation, Texturing). Here we see the additional grunt of the Nexus 6P paying dividends. Similarly, 2014’s Nexus 6 also puts in a fine performance compared to the newer Nexus 5X, which uses less RAM and the Snapdragon 808 CPU, versus more powerful Snapdragon’s and higher amounts of RAM inside the Nexus 6P. And if you’re interested in what the next-generation performance of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 looks like, simply look two rows down and have a butchers at the HTC 10 — it completely dominates everything in this list, including the Exynos-powered Galaxy S7 EDGE. Interestingly, the Nexus 6 really holds its own when compared to the Nexus 5X despite using an older SoC. What you’re seeing here is the power of having an extra GB of RAM at your disposal — the Nexus 6 has 3GB versus the Nexus 5X’s 2GB. In Geek Bench 3, which is designed to simulate real-world situations, it’s a similar picture: the Nexus 6P beats the Nexus 5X overall, followed by the Nexus 6. The HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 EDGE, on account of their improved processors and higher amounts of RAM, demonstrate their true next-generation status when compared to 2015 hardware with significant all round boosts to everyday tasks and overall performance.   Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Display Besides the internal specs, there's two other HUGE differences between the 5X and 6P. Let’s start with the most obvious: the display. The Nexus 5X has a 5.2 inch FHD LCD with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 at 423 ppi. The Nexus 6P, on the other hand, is clearly designed for those who want a phablet. It’s got a 5.7 inch WQHD AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 at 518 ppi. Size differences aside, the display on the 6P is superior in every way: from its higher resolution WQHD AMOLED panel to its insane 518 pixels per inch. The 6P also features a Gorilla Glass 4 display, while the 5X uses the older, less durable, Gorilla Glass 3 display. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Design The second major way the 5X and 6P differ is in their design. By now I’m sure you can tell that the 6P is designed to be the “premium” model of the two–it’s meant to take on high class phones like the iPhone 6s and the Samsung Galaxy S6. As a result it’s got a quality all-metal body that is sleek and sophisticated. That metal body also allows for the 6P to actually be thinner than the smaller 5X. The 6P is 7.3mm thick, while the 5X is 7.9mm thick. The 6P comes in four colors: Aluminium, Graphite, Frost, and Gold–though gold is only available in Japan. The reason the 5X is thicker than the 6P is because its body is made of smooth plastic. That won’t be a deal breaker for some, but for those that want the sleekest phone out there, metal bodies are where it’s at. The 5X comes in three colors: Carbon, Quartz, and Ice. Build materials and thickness aside, on the whole both devices are very similar in design and aesthetics, keeping that signature Nexus bodystyle with a smoothly rounded back panel and curvy corners. They're quite pleasant to look at, and little accents such as the Nexus 5X's round camera port and round fingerprint scanner side-by-side do have their charm. On the Nexus 6P, instead you have a large bar shape at the top housing the optics, and this does protrude slightly, while the round fingerprint scanner remains in the same place - while the Nexus 6P may be the more "premium" of the two in terms of build quality it has to be said the back panel is a little less elegant visually. Perhaps more important, though also more obvious, is the sheer size and mass of each device though. Of course we've covered this in the display size section to an extent, but it's also relevant in terms of design and handling properties - without wishing to state the bleeding obvious; the Nexus 6P is a MASSIVE 6in phone, so it's going to feel very different to operate and occupy more pocket space, and to be frank this is not everyone's cup of tea. If you have big hands you might be ok, but otherwise, expect a bit of unweildiness. The Nexus 5X, on the other hand (ha) is your typical 5in size and much more manageable for the average smartphone user. As usual, this comes down to personal preference and just what compromises you're prepared to make for the sake of better handling, or alternatively for things like, say, a massive but beautiful display, metal bodywork, and much better battery life. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Cameras Surprisingly even though both phones have until this point been very different, they are exactly the same in the rear camera department. Both phones feature a 12.3 MP, 1.55 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture rear camera that shoots 4K video. They both also have dual-LED flash and laser auto-focus. Where the phones differ is in the front camera. The 5X offers a 5 MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.0 front lens, while the 6P bumps that up to a 8MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.4 aperture front lens. However, all is not well in camp Nexus following reports of serious issues with the camera.  The glass seems to break for no apparent reason, and it’s not clear what caused the damage, according to one user on Reddit. “Well that was a surprise. For me, and the cat,” johny_rat wrote on Reddit. It was sat on a table next to me when I heard the glass snap, leaving a little snowfall of shavings on the table under it. It’s now continuing to crack away to itself.” “A different user said he reported the same problem to Google, which directed him to Huawei for future guidance,” notes BGR. “If this is a design issue, it’s likely all affected Nexus 6P will be repaired or replaced. Of course, for some people it might be difficult to prove the screen didn’t crack following an accidental drop.” Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Battery & Connectivity As far as connectivity, each phone features exactly the same innards: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, and a USB Type-C connector. The 5X has a smaller battery at 2,700 mAh versus the 6P’s 3,450 mAh battery, but that won’t necessarily translate to longer battery life in the 6P. After all, it’s got a much more power hungry display to run.  In our tests the Nexus 6P had very decent battery performance, even more so when you consider the handset runs a QHD panel. A lot of this is down to the sheer size of the battery cell, granted, but there is also Android Marshmallow’s role to factor; it has a bunch of new power saving features designed to not only extend the battery life of Android phones but also boost their idle performance by quite a considerable margin. Naturally with both phones being sealed unibody devices the battery cells are not removable in either device. The Nexus 6P is the better phone in all regards, including battery performance. In our tests we found the Nexus 6P to rank among the top five handsets of last year for battery performance — it really is that good. Testing battery life in a demonstrable manner is difficult because everybody uses phones differently. I might work a phone harder than, say, your Uncle Tim. But one way of showing how battery’s perform under pressure is through a video-playback test, whereby a video is looped until the phone dies. This is more of an endurance drain-test and, while not representative of everyday use, does give us a good idea of the battery’s overall performance when factor in with our anecdotal findings while roading testing the handset in the real world. And as you can see above, the results aren’t really all that surprising: the Nexus 6P beats the Nexus 5X by quite a margin and the newer HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 EDGE are WAY out in front. Largely, this uplift is down to better CPUs and more efficient software and power management. Still, the Nexus 6P isn’t bad by any stretch of the imagination. It’s just that this year’s phone makers REALLY upped their game with respect to battery life. And that’s something we can all appreciate. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Price & Verdict The Nexus 5X is £339 for the 16GB model and £379 for the 32GB model. The Nexus 6P is £449 for the 32GB model, £499 for the 64GB version, and £579 for the128GB variant. But as usual, your choice probably won’t come down to price or even internal specs–it will come down to the display size. Do you want a big smartphone (if so, get the 5X) or a massive phablet (then the 6P is your guy). You can now pick up the Nexus 5X for next to nothing on Amazon.  That’s not to say the two phones are similar in other ways–they clearly are not. Spec for spec the 6P is better by a long shot in almost every way. But as I said, most of us buy based on display size–and if you’re like most of us (and you’re only deciding between these two phones) then their size is probably going to be the deciding factor for you.

There isn’t a need for a hardware upgrade on your end, because a software update is bringing some of Google Pixel’s features to your handsets including Google Assistant.  As of late, voice-activated AI assistant Google Assistant is exclusive to Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. But things are about to change because Google is rolling out the feature to the Nexus devices as well. 9To5Google reporter Stephen Hall recently took to Twitter to announce that he was informed about the arrival of the voice assistant to the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P via an upcoming “major” update.  Though it's a remarkable feat for Google Assistant to reach out to other handsets, it won’t be the first Pixel-exclusive feature to make it to the Nexus devices. Engadget reports that the latest update that came to the Nexus 5X already brought Pixel’s “fingerprint swipe” gesture to the handset. This feature basically allows one to swipe up and down on the fingerprint sensor to scan through notifications.  Related Stories Google Chrome For iOS Now Lets You Scan QR Codes Without Using Another App Android 7.0 Nougat Samsung Galaxy S7 Release Date: T-Mobile Now Testing Google Software    Google Sets Up $4 Million Immigration Crisis Fund After Trump Ban The “fingerprint swipe” feature is part of Android 7.1.2 OTA. So far, it is only available to the Nexus 5X. There isn’t a clear indication yet if this software update is coming to the Nexus 6P. However, since both the Nexus 5X and the 6P are getting Google Assistant soon, it is possible that the latter would also be getting the same Android treatment.  Meanwhile, Mashable reports the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6 are not the only devices that will be getting the special treatment from Google. Android TV via the Nexus Player and Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches are also expected to receive an update that will introduce Google Assistant to them. Even the upcoming LG G6 from Samsung’s big South Korea-based rival is also known to be getting Google’s competitor for Apple’s Siri.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

(Associated Press files) By BARBARA ORTUTAY, Associated Press Published: February 5, 2017, 6:05 AM A   A NEW YORK — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of women and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. • THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING. Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress, Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. • WHY IT MATTERS. Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: • Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. • Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. • Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece, Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.” • INTO THE PIPELINE. Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. • WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN’T FIT. Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” “dominant” and “leader” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. • MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN. Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says.

If you book Uber via Google Maps you can get £20 off your journey That’s why we took one of the hottest phones around right now, Google’s new flagship Pixel XL, for a one month test drive to see whether it lived up to the hype. And let’s just say those billboards are not lying. An Apple user’s review of the Google Pixel: Let’s get this straight. I am not an Apple whizz, neither do I claim to know everything about Android’s latest technology. But I am a heavy user of all Apple products, which is why I decided to compare Google’s flagship phone with Apple’s iPhone 7. (That and the fact that it’s just too fascinating not too). I then asked my colleague, a self-confessed technophobe, to share her thoughts on the Pixel. Here are our thoughts: (Picture: Ella Byworth/Apple/Google) Appearance If you want a sleek phone, the Google Pixel is it. The phone comes in two sizes, 5” or 5.5”, and is available in two colours, Quite Black and Very Silver. It’s thin, light and is made to feel good in your hands – just like the iPhone, but has a softer feel. Google’s year in review shows that 2016 hasn’t been all bad (promise) One major difference in appearance is that the imprint touch button is at the back of the phone rather than the front. At first, I couldn’t get my head around it, but after a while you realise it is easier to unlock your phone with one button while it’s resting in your palm. The only downside is that due to the size of the XL, you sometimes find yourself having to readjust the phone so that you can reach the touch keyboard. For that reason, I prefer Apple’s front touch button to Google’s – but on looks alone, the Pixel’s winning by far. Storage For all you Apple users out there, the storage on the Pixel is probably the most impressive feature of the phone. The phone offers unlimited photos and video storage which is great for those iPhone users constantly finding themselves having to upp their monthly payments of iCloud storage just so prized photos don’t disappear. (The struggle is real). And to make it even better, once you’ve taken a photo, Google Photos keeps all your photos backed up, organised, and searchable, so you can find and share them faster than ever. Is it the iVape? Apple patents its first ‘vapouriser’ device Apple, take note. Camera I’d buy the Pixel just for the camera.  It’s true that Apple’s low photographic capabilities are incredible but the Pixel’s camera is far superior. With the best-ever 89 DxoMark Mobile score, Pixel’s camera lets you take stunning photos in low light, bright light or any light, and you don’t even need a filter on it. It also has a Smartburst feature which lets you catch action shots as they happen and can also turn fast shots into gifs on the spot (my favourite feature). The Lens Blur feature allows you to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, so you can always be the centre of attention.

Sorry everyone, Apple says it won’t replace dodgy batteries in iPhone 6 Siri and I have never been friends due to the fact that she never gets what I’m asking straight away. Google’s Assistant on the other hand is faster and more capable, and can do most of what Siri can do. (She was a lifesaver when I needed to find the nearest Starbucks so I could use the bathroom!) Battery life Google’s phone comes with an impressive 18W charger that lasts well over a day and a half and only takes a short 15 minutes-or-so to charge up. Which is perfect for people like me who are constantly on their phone.

The Pixel, on the other hand, lasted the whole day, with me only having to put it back on charge before I went to bed. Pre-installed apps Coming from an Apple, pre-installed apps aren’t really a problem. But Samsung users and other Android users will know all too well about pre-installed bloatware that comes with the phone. Luckily, the Pixel comes with none of that and has the latest version of Android Nougat, giving the phone a guaranteed two years of software updates and three years of security updates. (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro) A technophobe’s experience of the Google Pixel – by Miranda Larbi. I’ve never really been interested in phones. I got my first mobile (which I didn’t have to share with my sister) at about 14 and ever since then, have always been at least two models behind everyone else. Japan unveils ‘toilet paper’ for smartphones So I’d literally never heard of Google Pixel before it got thrust into my hand at a demo. ‘This is the best camera phone available,’ I was told repeatedly. And to be fair, the camera in the iPhone 4S that I’d had for over two years did take shocking photos. So, I resigned my old phone to the back of my sock drawer and tried out the Pixel. Ease I am rubbish at technology and this phone did take a bit of time to get used to. Because it’s a Google phone, it works with your Gmail and I struggled for ages (and still am a little) in getting my Yahoo! account to show up in my emails. How to wean your tech-addicted child off their mobile phones and iPads What I do like about the Pixel is that your notifications are quite unobtrusive, so if you’re trying to ignore someone on Whatsapp, you can flick the notification screen down, see who is texting and then leave it and the tiny Whatsapp symbol will sit quietly in the top left corner. Easy to ignore. My one bugbear, however, is the difficulty in setting reminders. On Apple, there’s an actual reminder’s app and it was my lifeline. On this phone…I have no idea. I try to use the calendar and most of the time, the reminders never show up. It’s a relatively straightforward phone to use but I don’t think it’s made for idiots like the iPhone is. The Google Pixel lets you customise your own ‘live’ case – like this one (Picture: Metro.co.uk) Camera This is the most crucial thing about this phone. You could buy any number of big Androids if you just wanted a large phone. But the camera on Pixel is truly fantastic. You can blur out backgrounds. You can take selfies simply by shaking the phone to reverse the lens. I’ve been able to take some incredible photos (not to blow my own trumpet) of my baby niece using the Pixel and even my iPhone 7-owning mum has agreed that my pictures have come out better than her’s. Praise indeed, from such a committed Apple user and one who spent I don’t want to know how much on the 7 solely for its camera capabilities.

And that was fine on my old phone but the Pixel is massive. It is hard to text with one hand and I have ended up sending some very odd Whatsapp messages to people as a result. But the display is infinitely superior to any phone I’ve ever used. The menu is clearer. The screen is better for watching videos and iPlayer. Fire Emblem Heroes is Nintendo’s next smartphone app Apps The size and camera both affect the quality of apps. I used to use Instagram before but it’s almost impossible not to upload a picture every day now simply because the quality of the picture is so much better and the shutter speed is so quick. And the filming capacity on Pixel also means you can upload all kinds of good-looking videos to Instagram. I, for example, am trying to track my fitness progress and this phone is perfect for taking progress videos of rehabilitation exercises – something I’d never have bothered with on my own rubbish phone. Snapchat is another app which is greatly improved, which now means I waste far too much time snap-chatting pictures of my cats to all and sundry. The Google Pixel was released in October 2016 (Picture: Reuters) Storage One of the problems with my old phone was the complete lack of storage. I had to delete pictures every week and as for downloading Spotify playlists? Forget it. Pixel’s storage is incredible. I’ve taken so many random photos already and there doesn’t seem to be any letting up anytime soon. And they’re all automatically categorised and backed up to my Google account which is incredibly handy. Young girls’ phone numbers are being sold for 50p in India Security Unlike the iPhone, you unlock the Pixel screen with your fingerprint at the back of the phone and you can save two fingerprints (so a finger from both hand). IMO, that’s far better than the whole thumbprint on iPhone which for me always took a few attempts to get to work. However, my mate did manage to get into my phone the other day, I think by simply flicking her finger up the screen and perhaps guessing my password…so it’s not foolproof by any means. Alas, the Pixel has transformed me from being a very sociable, attentive companion into an obsessive texter, Instagrammer, and Snapchatter. It’s best phone I’ve ever used (not hard) and I’m damned if I’m going to give it up any time soon.

Suparno Sarkar   February 5, 2017 18:30 IST Sasikala NatarajanIANS While all eyes are on Sasikala Natarajan as she is set to become Tamil Nadu CM, her caste apparently is of major interest for people of the nation and Tamil Nadu in particular. Jallikattu protests: Jallikattu maintains caste system in villages, says Dalit leader One of the most searched keywords on Google currently is "sasikala natarajan caste," according to Google trends. Sasikala, who is the general secretary of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), has been chosen as the leader of the party on February 5, which means that she will become the next Tamil Nadu CM. This new development made Sasikala, who is popularly known as Chinnamma among her supporters, one of the most searched topics on Google on Sunday. Although interested people have also been looking for other information on her family, her son, her speech, etc, Google trends suggest that Sasikala's caste has been garnering most attention. When we type "sasikala natarajan" on Google search bar, "sasikala natarajan caste" comes up as the first suggestion, followed by "sasikala natarajan son", "sasikala natarajan speech" and "sasikala natarajan family". "sasikala natarajan caste" appearing on top of the suggestion list shows that it is the most searched keyword on Google. Google screenshot Google trends also show that Tamil Nadu people have been searching about the lady on Google the most. India is one such nation that apparently has always been much obsessed with caste and creed, and Sasikala's caste instead of her qualification being so much of importance validates the same again. Sasikala, came into limelight after the demise of former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa. She was a close aide of Amma and thus, most members of AIADMK wanted Sasikala to take over the post of CM after the former's demise. She will replace current Tamil Nadu CM O Panneerselvam.

Google Play Store vs Apple’s App Store - A Comparison GO Which is friendlier for users, Play Store or App Store? Feb 5, 2017 12:12 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  The two biggest players in the app market are surely Google and Apple with their own dedicated stores for users to find and download applications for almost anything. While Google Play Store features a greater number of apps, the App Store is the place where developers can capitalize their work more. Apple launched its App Store in 2008 when the iPhone 3G was announced. 500 apps were available at first, but within 5 years their number passed the 1 million milestone. Last quarter, Apple’s App Store saw a 60% year-on-year revenue growth, while the Play Store grew by 82%, and the total number of apps reached 2.7 million in January 2017, compared to 2.2 million in the App Store. The Play Store was launched in 2008, formerly known as Android Market, and it quickly outgrew the App Store and reached about 64 billion downloads in 2016, while the App Store recorded just a little over 25 billion downloads during the same year, according to App Annie. App Store and Play Store downloads worldwide Free and paid apps in stores From a developer’s perspective, the best place to monetize an app is surely the App Store, considering that it generated $5.4 billion in revenue in Q4 2016, while the Play Store only managed to generate $3.3 billion in the same quarter. Both the Play Store and the App Store offer the same revenue-sharing terms to developers, 70% of the amount paid by users goes to developers. However, since there are fewer apps in the App Store, developers could generate more revenue here compared to the Play Store. Reports have shown that iOS users don’t mind paying for a reliable app, while the situation in the Play Store is quite different. Because many apps compete in the same category, developers tend to make their apps free in order to attract more users. Top free apps in the App Store This poses an advantage for users, but not really for developers. To monetize on their apps, they would sometimes incorporate ads, which could drive some users to competing cleaner apps. Seeing how the size of the App Store is smaller, the competition isn’t that harsh. Paying a few dollars a month for a good app isn’t bothersome for iOS users, but it could drive some of them to the Play Store’s free alternatives. Instant apps and beta testing Google’s Play Store allows users to push app installation on all of their phones and tablets in an instant. If you want to install the same app on your iPhone and iPad, you’d have to do it manually for both devices. It’s not that big of an inconvenience, but it does make a difference in terms of usability. Moreover, Google is currently testing Instant Apps for Android users. This means that users will no longer need to download an entire app in order to check out its content. Bits and parts of the app are installed on the device instantly, allowing users to access content and save space on the device. Many times, users receive a message or tap on a link that can be opened only in a specific app. With Instant Apps, they no longer need to install an entire application just to see a picture or read an article. Apple’s iPhone users don’t have this functionality. The Play Store also offers users the option to test out beta apps and get the latest features. Beta versions are sometimes unstable, but users can opt out of beta testing at any time. Types of apps Android mobile OS runs on an abundance of smartphones and tablets, with different CPUs, RAM capacity and display sizes. Android developers usually make their apps available to a greater number of devices, compared to iOS. While most apps in the App Store work both on iPhones and iPads, there are still some that are exclusive to smartphones and weren’t properly adapted to the larger screen of an iPad. In terms of app categories, education, lifestyle, entertainment, business and personalization are the most popular in the Play Store. Users can find an abundance of apps that meet their needs, whichever that is. The phrase “There’s an app for that” launched by Apple a few years ago to promote its App Store has started applying to its main competitor, the Play Store. Play Store top apps Apple has a tendency to promote games on its App Store, which is where Apple makes a lot of revenue. One prolific case is that of the highly anticipated Super Mario Run which was launched on iOS first, while the Android version still hasn’t arrived yet. To maximize the impact of their apps, many developers have launched versions for both iOS and the Play Store, but the latter has some more options. Play Store offers apps for customizing your rooted phone by automating certain commands using Tasker or other apps. Reviews and refunds Searching for an app is much easier on the Play Store, considering that Google excels in creating efficient search algorithms. Google also integrated Google+ features, so whenever you’re reading reviews for an app, those written by your friends appear at the top. Receiving a recommendation from a friend weighs more compared to reading reviews from complete strangers. However, Apple has a system that promotes apps with ratings higher than 4 stars giving them a boost and improving their rank to make it easier for users to discover them. In addition, Apple is believed to work on a system that allows developers to ask users to rate an app just three times in a year. Some apps downloaded from the Play Store will ask users for ratings continuously. Users who paid for apps downloaded from the Google Play Store can get a refund within 2 hours of making the purchase. The no-questions-asked refund policy is even more appealing on the App Store, with a 14-day return policy for customers in the European Union and other regions. Security They say the App Store is safer, and that might be true considering that Apple takes a lot of time to review each app individually. In fact, this is one of the main principles behind the store for iOS, applications are reviewed and receive a rating from Apple, a process that can take a little over a week. This way, Apple wants to make sure that apps in its store follow guidelines. App Brain revealed that the number of low-quality apps reached 337,000 on the Play Store last month, but there aren’t any such numbers for iOS. Low-quality apps don’t necessarily contain malware, but they don’t improve user experience. On the flip side, it’s much faster to publish apps on the Play Store, as long as they meet Android guidelines. There have been many cases in which malicious apps made it to the Play Store, Google would remove an app only if it’s reported by a number of people. Even though Apple reviews apps firsthand, that doesn’t mean they’re necessarily safer. A prolific case was the XcodeGhost malware which infected 4,000 apps. In order to create an iOS app, developers must use Apple’s Xcode program which has a size of 3GB. In countries where Internet speed is quite slow, like China, it can take about an hour to download. Therefore, some developers downloaded the program containing the malware from third-party websites and thus infected their apps and the phones of users. Conclusion Depending on which smartphone you own, you will be using apps from the Play Store or the App Store. But if you were to pick a phone simply based on apps that you would like to use, both stores offer their advantages and disadvantages. The Play Store and Android offers a lot more flexibility for users in terms of customization and types of apps, but the Apple Store has more secure apps. However, Apple’s App Store seems to be focusing on games, while the Play Store is filled with photo editing and education apps. Android apps are clearly cheaper and there are completely free alternatives to any app that you might wish to check out. But in terms of security, iOS apps are safer, although there have been apps with malware in the App Store too. We’re leaning towards the Play Store, but let us know what your thoughts are.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Google#Apple#Play Store#App Store#Instant apps subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google Play Store vs Apple App Store (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Now Launcher to Be Discontinued by the End of March Google Photos 2.8 Gets Redesigned UI and Changes to Device Folders Nintendo Releases Fire Emblem: Heroes for Android and iOS, Servers Struggle Instagram Is Testing Multi-Photo Album Support in New Version Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One 4 photos    Play Store and App Store logos New Android APKs HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro Might Arrive on February 28, Leaked Retail Video Suggests more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

RAISR, which stands for Rapid and Accurate Image Super-Resolution, utilizes machine learning to sharpen low-resolution images. Google claims that not only are the results from RAISR as good or better than comparable methods, but RAISR can produce its results 10 to 100 times faster, resulting in the process being able to run in real-time on a mobile device. This is certainly an impressive feat, but RAISR can also avoid aliasing artifacts in the final image, even when artifacts exist in the low-resolution original. You can read more about RAISR’s learning process in Google’s post, but the sample images they shared are worth sharing here.   As you can see above, RAISR did an impressive job creating a high-resolution output image (bottom), even though the original source image was low-resolution (top).     On the left is an original low-resolution image with aliasing artifacts. On the right is the image after RAISR improved its quality and removed the artifacts. Another impressive result for RAISR. Of their super-resolution technology, Google says, “Super-resolution technology, using one or many frames, has come a long way. Today, the use of machine learning, in tandem with decades of advances in imaging technology, has enabled progress in image processing that yields many potential benefits. For example, in addition to improving digital “pinch to zoom” on your phone, one could capture, save, or transmit images at lower resolution and super-resolve on demand without any visible degradation in quality, all while utilizing less of mobile data and storage plans.” On the topic of reducing bandwidth, Google states that RAISR has been able to reduce bandwidth use by up to 75 percent in their implementation of the technology for displaying large images on Google+. Google+ requests a quarter of the pixels of the original image and RAISR, in real-time on the device requesting to view the image, restores the detail. Google is currently using RAISR on over a billion images per week, which has reduced total bandwidth by roughly a third. The technology will be rolled out beyond its current subset of Android devices in the coming weeks. Computation imaging and machine learning has come a long way in recent years and we are seeing machine learning and artificial intelligence appear more frequently in photography software. Its results have not always been great, but it does show promise and RAISR looks to be one of the more impressive implementations of machine learning.

MNR Daily HOME U.S. WORLD ENTERTAINMENT SCIENCE/HEALTH TECH LIFE Subscriptions Home TECH Sony to release new security patch in February which covers Xperia family Patrick Leonard Mayo Feb 5, 2017 5:44 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Facebook / Sony Mobile)Official promotional image for the Sony Xperia XZ Smartphone manufacturer Sony Mobile started the month on a high note by pushing the February 2017 firmware updates for its Xperia platforms. A report from Xperia Blog confirmed that the latest set of Google security patches will cover the Xperia X, the Xperia XZ, the X Compact, and the X Performance. The patches for the Xperia XZ and X Performance have a build number 39.2.A.0.417 while the ones for Xperia X and X Compact come with build number 34.2.A.0.311. In a report by Android Authority, this move by Sony brings them a step ahead of Google, since the latter has yet to issue the security updates to the Nexus and Pixel devices, including the Android 7.1.2 beta release. As for the specific concerns that are addressed by the patches, the report confirmed that Android has not yet posted any details for this month. Last December, the X Peformance and the Xperia XZ were updated with Android Nougat, although the update missed the security patches from Google that were released toward the latter part of the month. Last month, however, the Xperia X and the X Compact received the second release of updates, which offered bug fixes, highlighted by addressing the clock's tendency to reset whenever users rebooted their smartphones. Another concern that was taken head-on by the update was the smartphone's vulnerability, wherein code execution and remote access can be enabled on affected units. Meanwhile, Sony also released its financial results for the last quarter of 2016, wherein 5.1 million units of the Xperia smartphone were sold. The number, however, proved to be dismal compared to the sales in the same period in 2015, which accounted for 2.5 million units more. Sony Mobile sold a total of 15 million units last year, which, incidentally, was also the lowest they have sold since Sony acquired Ericsson's shares in 2012.

However, some were able to confirm in an email that Google is still producing the phones and is going to restock Pixels and Pixel XLs soon. Here’s what we know so far about the Google Pixel and Pixel XL news. Pixel and Pixel XL Discontinuation? According to 9to5google’s report, Google is having trouble keeping up with Pixels and Pixel XLs demand in the market. Additionally, Canadian carrier Telus has confirmed that they’re not going to restock units of these new Google phones. Currently, However, Telus had to reconfirm that they haven’t restocked these phones yet as it has sent a wrong message to the consumers. Their previous message may have indirectly confirmed that Google has stopped producing these phones. For now, Telus won’t be able to provide Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones until further notice. Waiting For Stock Currently, the Google Pixel craze is caused by the low supply of these phones in the market. According to sportflex’s thread on the Android Reddit, some consumers were expecting their phones from Telus but won’t have it due to the lack of supply. We’ll have to wait for Google’s announcement for their next international restocking of this phone. Google Pixel Specs According to the official Google Pixel page, the new Google phone has specs focusing on its improved camera and photo storage options. The Google Pixel has a 12.3 Megapixel camera which means better photos. The Pixel also has a large 1.55 µm size per pixel which allows users shoot pictures in a wider range of light exposure.  Lastly, Google’s Pixel’s camera has an f/2.0 Aperture which makes it more closer to regular cameras. Google’s flagship phone is definitely aiming itself to be phone focused on taking photos. “Unlimited Picture and Video” space Additionally, Google Pixel has confirmed to have “unlimited storage for all your photos and videos”. However, this is just a technical system with the Google Pixel and Google’s cloud storage site Google Drive. According to androidcentral, Google Pixel users can upload their photos and videos to Google Drive should they want to keep it longer. Technically, you have 15GB online cloud storage worth of videos and pictures with this feature. The Google Pixel may still have to delete some pictures and videos especially if you’re not always connected to the internet. Perhaps, some additional changes may happen to the Google Pixel as it’s being restocked. Stay updated with more Google Pixel news here on TheBitBag.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. Getty Images The official seal of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is seen on an iPhone camera screen outside the J. Edgar Hoover headquarters in Washington, DC. The judge said this was because there was "no meaningful interference" with the account holder's "possessory interest" in the data sought. "Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States," Rueter wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc, said in a statement on Saturday: "The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants."The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that U.S. investigators sought in a narcotics case.

LG Watch Style and Sport release date brought forward? by Sean Keach 05 February 2017 0 shares Read Comments LG’s new smartwatches will be landing alongside Android Wear 2.0 on February 8, apparently. According to prolific tipster and journalist Evan Blass (a.k.a Evleaks), the launch of Google’s new wearable OS and the software’s flagship devices has been brought forward. It was previously expected that we’d see the official debut on February 9, but it could now take place on Wednesday. In a post to Twitter, Blass wrote: “Update: The launch of both the watches and the platform have been moved up a day, to February 8th." Google has already confirmed that Android Wear 2.0 will be coming in early February, but hasn’t given a specific date. And neither Google nor LG has admitted that there may be two LG-branded smartwatches – both carrying Android Wear 2.0 fresh out of the box – on the way. These watches are expected to be called the LG Watch Style and the LG Watch Sport. Fortunately, the latter appears to have been caught out on the Geekbench benchmarking platform. In a test readout for what appears to be the LG Watch Sport, the wearable was revealed to have a quad-core CPU clocked to 1.09GHz, as well as 768MB of RAM, a 1.38-inch display (480 x 480 pixels), 4GB of storage, and a 430mAh battery. With mere days to go until the prospective launch, it’s no surprise to see such a benchmark result leak out. It’s also good news that we won’t have to wait long to find out whether this leak was credible or not. So until then, take this report with due caution.

However, as the Mountain View giant brings in more features to its famous browser, it is also giving away more hints at what its Andromeda project would be like.  Just this weekend, Android Police learned that Chrome v57 has entered the beta stage ahead of the next update’s official release. Beta testing of course entails an early preview of what the software update will bring to the table. According to the tech news site, new features like CSS Grid, Fullscreen Media Orientation and improved media notifications are part of the new beta build.  CSS Grid helps in web designing because it provides a grid layout where websites can be crafted. Fullscreen Media Orientation is a feature that allows users to change the orientation of the video without necessarily changing the orientation of the phone. This is very similar to how the YouTube app works. As for improved media notifications, it basically refers to the customization users can do with the notification icons they can view and use on the Chrome app. Chrome v57 has Media Session API support, so users can now modify the music notifications to their liking.  Related Stories Google Chrome For iOS Now Lets You Scan QR Codes Without Using Another App Gmail Terminating Chrome For XP, Vista Support Google Sets Up $4 Million Immigration Crisis Fund After Trump Ban Among the new features, two others give users an idea of what the future holds for Google’s browser. One is WebAssembly, which gives web apps more freedom and control over low-level operations than JavaScript. The other one has to do with the improvements on PWA or Progressive Web Apps. Google has already confirmed that deeper integration of PWA with Android is in the works. Based on these two alone, it is clear Google is going for a future where the best of the web and the best of apps meet. If this is telling consumers something, it’s the fact that Google is moving forward with Andromeda — the merging of Chrome and Android.  Android Central also believes that Andromeda is already underway, especially now that Google is talking about PWA on its blog. The Android-centric news site pointed out that apart from the advancements in the Android OS, there really are a lot of amazing things happening at the Mountain View giant. This is because Google is not only planning for what’s next for its platforms, but also for what’s coming after what’s next. With PWA, users will soon find themselves having the web as the global app store and their smartphones as the tool they can use to access the web interface of almost anything.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Sure, Google’s use of machine learning might not be anything new, but understanding how it’s using this technology is vital for the sector which can sometimes struggle to satisfy its notoriously fickle and savvy customer base. NB: This is an analysis by Daniel Bensley, travel industry lead at Qubit. To me, this report highlights a wider challenge for the industry around our approach to AI and machine learning techniques. Whether it’s Google changing its search ranking metrics or technology’s impact on jobs in the sector, headlines around AI are often more likely to spark fear rather than excitement. The fact of the matter is that everyone, across all sectors, needs to better understand how to harness this technology to identify, reach and engage with customers. For the travel industry, in particular, the benefits can be enormous if the technology is understood. Supercharge segmentation The travel sector has regularly outspent all other industries on pay-per-click ads, yet with sometimes as many as 80% of customers abandoning their shopping carts on travel websites there is clearly a wide gap between acquisition and satisfaction. Put simply, travel brands have spent too much time and money trying to attract eyes to their websites instead of thinking about how they can delight customers when they arrive on the site. Naturally travel’s sale cycles tend to be longer and involve a greater degree of research than other sectors, but there is still plenty of room for improvement for operators looking to provide a more relevant, satisfying experience for customers – this can only be achieved by building a better understanding of who your customers are and what they need. Segmentation in travel is nothing new – the sector is in a fantastic position since customers are only too happy to hand over information about who they are and what they are searching for. But many operators are still only scratching the surface, building basic, core segments, using limited data such as “First-time customers vs Repeat customers” or varied stages of the purchase journey. Machine learning can add to and analyse data about a visitor’s behaviour and needs far quicker than any human can, in order to create a hyper-detailed picture of that customer and build deeper, more sophisticated segments. For example, a customer may let you know they’re based in the UK and searching for a family holiday for two adults and two children. A deeper analysis of previous purchase behaviour, combined with real-time customer feedback could tell you that this customer is in the ‘intent to purchase’ phase and likely to be interested in short haul flights, within the school holidays and would respond best to speaking to a call centre adviser. Armed with these insights, a travel brand can then choose how to best engage with this customer in a much more meaningful way than before. With so many variables to factor into travel marketing, machine learning represents a tremendous opportunity for businesses to become far more accurate and targeted with their segmentation efforts. Uncover new opportunities Those headlines that examine the opportunities of AI tend to focus on the end of the funnel – a host of brands have rolled out chatbots to assist customers in finding low-cost flights, while VisitOrlando attracted plaudits for its bot that went a step further and could point interested travellers in the direction of popular brunch spots and craft beer bars. This is obviously the sexier end of the AI spectrum, but in my opinion, the real opportunity is far less visible and much more powerful. AI and machine learning can not only supercharge travel brands’ existing segmentation practices by answering questions about who your customers are – it can help spot entirely new opportunities by identifying more nuanced patterns in this data that would otherwise go unnoticed by a human analyst. Brands can then choose what they want to serve up to these new segments. As we approach St Valentine’s Day you may see customers searching for city breaks during the evening of February 13 are open to spending more than those browsing during for couples getaways in late January. You can make up your own mind on whether these are forgetful last-minute spouses desperately searching for a last-minute gift – machine learning’s role here is to flag the new pattern. You can then decide how you can better serve these desperate customers and point them in the direction of temporary offers for romantic getaways that suit their needs and boost your average order value at the same time. AI shouldn’t be approached as a panacea for the travel sector, but it shouldn’t be feared either. As it stands, machine learning is an incredibly useful tool that allows travel operators to seize opportunities they don’t know exist yet, but like any tool it’s important to not jump in and start using it before having a clear understanding of how you want to use it and the outcomes you want to see. You also need to ensure you’re feeding your AI platform the right data – provide useless information, expect useless results. Ultimately we do need to be careful in developing AI, but not for the reasons many believe. The danger isn’t that we lose control, lose our jobs (it will free us up to do more meaningful tasks) or that Google decides your website isn’t important enough. The true danger is that we let this tech revolution pass us by without tapping into its true potential beyond headline-grabbing bots. AI’s untapped opportunities are legion – if it screws up, then we’re to blame. NB: This is an analysis by Daniel Bensley, travel industry lead at Qubit.

There were none in the article. Reply 7 days ago   Andy We use it for inferring intent for each customer. It means we can then automatically change the sort order (of hotels or holidays, for example) and make them “probably” much better suited to an individual user. There are so many combinations that it would not be possible to do this with normal segmentation or by using hypotheses. Still much room to improve but the results are good and we see more and more uses for the data models that are refined and altered in real time. Reply 5 days ago   Dorian Harris @Andy I get the theory, I’ve just never seen it work in practice, so it would be good to see what you’re working on. From the AI solutions I have experienced first hand, iTunes ‘Genius’ recommendations fall a long way short of genius and Amazon’s ‘you may also like’ throws out loads of rubbish. From what I can see, even Google isn’t a pure AI solution – it’s a rule based system, uploaded in bulk every so often. Here at Skoosh we developed a rule-based fraud system which out-performed all the AI based solutions offered by banks, again despite the fact that banks have far more data to work with. The only time where AI out-performed manual solutions for us was on data-matching which is a completely different use-case to product recommendations.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Unlike Microsoft Google may have to hand over overseas Gmail accounts to US government 1 by Surur  @mspoweruser Feb 5, 2017 at 7:00 GMT6 days ago It seems Microsoft has been somewhat more successful than Google in protecting the privacy of their overseas users. On Friday (4th Feb 2017) U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled that Google needed to provide the FBI with access to emails stored overseas as part of fulfilling the demands of a search warrant for a domestic fraud case. Google had argued that emails may be stored in USA and in part in servers round the world, and that the company should only hand over the bits residing on servers in USA. U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia however ruled that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally did not qualify as a seizure. “Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,” Rueter wrote. The judge said this was because there was “no meaningful interference” with the account holder’s “possessory interest” in the data sought. Last year Microsoft won a somewhat similar case involving email from an Irish citizen stored in Ireland, and Google was relying on a precedent this set in this case, but it likely failed due to Google trying to stretch the precedent too far. While Google fragments email around the world for performance reasons, Microsoft place servers around the world specifically for reasons of data privacy and jurisdiction, meaning Irish emails for example are stored in Ireland and subject to Irish, not US laws. The news is relevant particularly in this day and age where the US administration has specifically worked to strip foreigners of privacy protections in USA. If every Gmail in the world is considered to reside in USA and accessible to US investigators then it seems storing your email there is rather risky. Google responded by saying they would appeal the decision, saying: “The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants.” Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday February 11, 2017 Life & Style Health Larger / SmallerNight Mode How Sydney cancer scientist Jennifer Byrne became a research fraud super sleuth Kate Aubusson 26 Jan 2017, 2:28 p.m. It was a gut feeling that had Professor Jennifer Byrne flipping open her laptop on a Saturday night and firing up the medical equivalent of a Google search. How Sydney cancer scientist Jennifer Byrne became a research fraud super sleuth Professor Jennifer Byrne discovered evidence that scientists in China may be plagiarising research papers. Photo: Wolter Peeters Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit It was a gut feeling that had Professor Jennifer Byrne flipping open her computer on a Saturday night and firing up the medical equivalent of a Google search. What she found made her sick to her stomach. The children's cancer expert had stumbled upon what appeared to be potentially widespread research fraud. In a world of fake news, where opinion is given as much weight as empirical evidence, and scientists as much consideration as shock jocks, research fraud is a damaging tinderbox for truth. "I was just horrified. I thought, 'My God, what have I found'," said Professor Byrne, head of the Children's Cancer Research Unit at the Children's Hospital Westmead and University of Sydney academic. The professor of molecular oncology had turned science sleuth, identifying a total of 48 papers published in scientific journals sharing uncanny similarities, flaws and mismatched data all by independent researchers in China. Professor Byrne first noticed something was amiss in 2015 when a few too many papers were popping up purporting to study a gene she was very familiar with - LPD52L2 (L2) - having been the first to identify it almost 20 years ago. "At first I thought it was the same paper, they were so similar. But then I realised there were five of them," she said. L2 is something of an "orphan" gene with an unknown function that could have implications for cancer treatment, but it doesn't attract a lot of attention. The way the papers reported their findings and the flaws in their sequences were strikingly similar, Professor Byrne found. Their poor English and grammar, the strikingly similar references and their seemingly superficial experiments set off alarm bells. Professor Byrne dug deeper, finding the same sequences were being used for completely different purposes: a sequence used as a positive control in one research paper was used as a negative control in another. "You don't have to be a scientist to know that's a major logical flaw," Professor Byrne said. "In many cases it was highly unlikely or impossible that they could have obtained the results they obtained," she said. She wrote to the four journals that had published the papers. Two journals investigated and one issued a retraction. The authors of the paper admitted they had obtained their data from a commercial biotechnology company without disclosing this partnership. This was just the tip of the iceberg. Professor Byrne's Saturday night search on the medical research aggregation site PubMed led to the discovery of another 43 papers that shared highly dubious similarities. The papers all described single gene knockdowns - a technique used to modify a gene using RNA. The uniformities were as glaring as the authors' choice of title, the data, descriptions, images, table layouts, even the font and bolding of specific annotations. Often, the papers' text wouldn't match the data in the tables, again suggesting the authors had obtained their data form a third party, most likely an undisclosed biotechnology company. Professor Byrne and her colleague computer scientist Cyril Labbe at the University of Grenoble Alpes, France, published their findings in Scientometrics. "I think we also have to recognise that until we actually prove the origins that we discuss in the paper I guess the authors have a right to be presumed innocent to an extent," Professor Byrne said, "I'm hoping that at least some of these papers will prove to have been performed by the authors as they described in their papers." But she suspected there were hundreds of papers with similar flaws. Under-investigated genes that attracted little attention could be fertile ground for researchers under overwhelming pressure to "publish or perish", Professor Byrne said. Career security can hinge on the number of published works a scientist has produced. Chinese researchers may be especially vulnerable, with many institutions setting strict quotas for their scientists. The papers were also published in journals that are fairly low down on the list of prestigious titles, and may have lower standards for publication. The damage done by research fraud cannot be understated, Professor Byrne said. "Science runs on brainpower and funding but also trust," she said. "I need to believe the researchers are doing what they say they're doing. I'm not in their lab staring over their shoulders, and if I can't be confident that what I'm reading is correct I may as well go and work at my local shopping centre. "The public needs to trust what we do. Governments need to trust what we do, especially in this 'post truth' world where experts are shot down and dismissed so easily," she said. The papers, like the bulk of published research, urges others to continue their work. Researchers who are waylaid by trying to replicate faulty data could have been working towards findings that may have had a real impact on the lives of patients. "They could be following up complete rubbish. It violates everything you're working towards," Professor Byrne said.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — In August 2016, Google was ordered to comply with two search warrants from the FBI related to two criminal investigations, but submitted only the data stored on its US servers. The government then filed a motion to compel the IT company to hand over the rest of the information. "The court will grant the Government's motions to compel Google to comply with search warrants," Rueter said on Friday, in a ruling obtained by the Washington Post. Google alluded to the ruling in favor of Microsoft by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a similar case. YouTube/Matt Unsworth Robot Proves to Google He's Not a RobotIn Google's case the judge found that Google processed its foreign-stored data in a way that made it difficult to say where it exactlyt is at any given moment, which made it impossible for the United States to ask a foreign state for legal assistance. However, Google deliberately made the data searchable and accessible from the United States, therefore, it would be retrieved in California and handed over to the government in the United States. According to Google, a search warrant, if granted, can give the government access to email content, while subpoenas and court orders only allow access to non-content information, such as an account creation number, phone number, or sign-in IP address. ...

U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. The judge said this was because there was “no meaningful interference” with the account holder’s “possessory interest” in the data sought. “Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,” Rueter wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc, said in a statement on Saturday: “The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants.” The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that U.S. investigators sought in a narcotics case. That decision last July 14 was welcomed by dozens of technology and media companies, privacy advocates, and both the American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On Jan. 24, the same appeals court voted not to revisit the decision. The four dissenting judges called on the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns. Both cases involved warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law that many technology companies and privacy advocates consider outdated. In court papers, Google said it sometimes breaks up emails into pieces to improve its network’s performance, and did not necessarily know where particular emails might be stored. Relying on the Microsoft decision, Google said it believed it had complied with the warrants it received, by turning over data it knew were stored in the United States. Google receives more than 25,000 requests annually from U.S. authorities for disclosures of user data in criminal matters, according to Rueter’s ruling.

SHARE Tips for getting the most out of your website Sent as BILL HAGGERTY MUG By Staff Saturday, February 4, 2017 Q: What is SEO and how does a business use it? A: SEO stands for search engine optimization. It is a practice used by website designers and website maintenance experts that aims to bring a website to the top of the screen when a search platform (Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.) is used. There are many ways to optimize your website for higher ranking in organic search results but the following are still considered best practice: • Easy to use • Mobile-device friendly • Contact information on every page • Appropriate page titles • Blog, news or portfolio page A strong website can be your highest-ranking salesperson and earn your largest return on investment against your other marketing platforms, if built correctly. Let’s take a deeper look into our top five SEO essentials for your company’s website. 1. Site map A site map is a design feature within your website where you can create an organized list of the web pages in your site in order for Google and other search engines to easily find what content is on your site and how it is organized. You may have heard of Googlebots, the crawlers that go out when someone types “Grand Junction vet” into Google. A site map allows the bots to quickly identify if your website is a suitable match for what the searcher may be looking for. 2. NAP listings NAP stands for name, address and phone listings in directories such as Google Maps, Yahoo! Local, Bing Local, Yelp, etc. These directories store valuable information about your business, including a link to your website and operating hours. The more information you provide to someone who is doing a local search, the more likely they are to choose you. That’s not to say that presentation (branding) and quality don’t make the ultimate impression, but providing the most basic information to the directory and searchers is a key first step. The NAP in these directories needs to match the NAP information on your website for optimal SEO results. 3. Blog/news web page(s) When a person types a phrase or question into a search engine, such as Google, the crawlers go out and search for corresponding information on websites. The sites which have relevant information (and are updated regularly) are often placed higher up in the results given to the searcher. A good way to boost relevant content on your website is to have a blog and/or news page. You can write the content for your blogs, have a digital expert manage your blog, hire a freelance writer, or have guest writers. A news feed is a great addition because you can post articles or videos that have been created about your business from established news outlets. These give the web crawlers rich information to decide if your website is relevant to a search and offer your web viewers a sense of trust in your company’s expertise. 4. Links/social media shares We could spend days discussing the value and methods of building your internal and external links but we’ll keep this short and to the point. The more links you have to and from your website, the higher a search engine tends to place you in search results. A good way to do this is by sharing your blog post’s URL with other experts in correlating fields to yours and/or online news outlets. If they find your information useful, they may create a link in one of their blog or article posts to site your information and website. An easy way to get this going is to share your blog/news posts on social media. This method will also boost the amount of traffic to your website which is another factor that plays into your organic search rankings. 5. Responsive/mobile-friendly design You may have seen this in our last column, but we cannot overstate the importance of having a website that is responsive. This means that it has been designed internally to respond to the screen size of the person viewing it. Google recently announced that its search results index is essentially switching to prioritize mobile-friendly sites. If you’re not 100 percent positive that your website has been designed with mobile in mind, we highly recommend getting an answer sooner rather than later if high search rankings are an important part of your marketing and local-presence plan. Done correctly, your website has the potential to be your highest earning salesperson. It will save you time so that you can focus on what you do best within your company.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. As part of the deal, Planet Labs will acquire the Terra Bella business including the SkySat constellation of satellites, Alphabet said. The seven SkySat high resolution satellites will complement the 60 medium resolution satellite fleet currently operated by Planet Labs. Jen Fitzpatrick, VP of Product and Engineering, Google, said “When we thought about a company that shares Terra Bella’s passion and strengths in high frequency satellite imaging, Planet was a natural home. Terra Bella has accomplished a lot in the past two years—including the design and launch of five more satellites. We’re excited to see what’s ahead for Terra Bella, and look forward to being a long-term customer.” Google will enter into a multi-year contract to purchase Earth-imaging data from Planet Labs after the deal closes. Google had acquired Terra Bella, originally known as Skybox Imaging, for $500 million in 2014. The deal will help Planet Labs broaden its available data and add new customers. Terra Bella Co-Founder John Fenwick said “From the start, Planet and Terra Bella have shared similar visions and approached aerospace technology from a like-minded position, and while our on-orbit assets and data are different, together we bring unique and valuable capabilities to users. Planet and Terra Bella together enables the continuation of our mission and makes for an ever-stronger business.” Planet Labs is one of several startups aiming to harness technology allowing satellites to become smaller and less expensive, making it easier to deploy large networks of satellites at less risk and lower cost than previously.

US Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. The judge said this was because there was “no meaningful interference” with the account holder’s “possessory interest” in the data sought. “Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,” Rueter wrote. Japan court rejects ‘right to be forgotten’ on Google Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc, said in a statement on Saturday: “The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants.” The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that US investigators sought in a narcotics case. That decision last July 14 was welcomed by dozens of technology and media companies, privacy advocates, and both the American Civil Liberties Union and US Chamber of Commerce. On Jan. 24, the same appeals court voted not to revisit the decision. The four dissenting judges called on the US Supreme Court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns. This new Gmail hack even has the most tech savvy falling for it Both cases involved warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law that many technology companies and privacy advocates consider outdated. In court papers, Google said it sometimes breaks up emails into pieces to improve its network’s performance, and did not necessarily know where particular emails might be stored. Relying on the Microsoft decision, Google said it believed it had complied with the warrants it received, by turning over data it knew were stored in the United States. Google receives more than 25,000 requests annually from US authorities for disclosures of user data in criminal matters, according to Rueter’s ruling.

Dave Lieber: Are you calling who you think you are? Comments () A Text Size Denton Record-Chronicle Published: 04 February 2017 10:52 PM Dear Watchdog: Can you recommend a good washing machine repairman? Our machine is on the fritz, and at our age we don’t want to buy a new one unless it’s absolutely necessary. — E.B. Dear E.B.: Let me tell you the repairman I wouldn’t hire. His name is Michael Stoneham, and in the past I’ve asked this question: Is Michael Stoneham the worst repairman in Texas? I’ve followed him for six years, first hearing how he took a $175 deposit from a Fort Worth man and disappeared. More recently, I told the story of the Dallas man who figured out Stoneham was overcharging him and pulled the plug. Stoneham retaliated with threatening text messages to both the man and his wife. The latest episode, though, should serve as a warning to anyone who ever taps a “call” button on their phone or computer they find through a Google business listing. Those phone numbers can be hijacked and switched to someone else without the business or its customers knowing. That’s how Shareen Grayson of Preston Hollow ended up inviting Stoneham, a convicted thief, through her front door to fix her Sub-Zero freezer. She looked for a repair person on her phone with a Google search, trying to find a number for C&W Appliance Repair, a 60-year-old business in Dallas. She tapped on the Google business listing’s phone number, but didn’t know that it rang instead to a leads company that passed the job on to Stoneham. I didn’t know someone other than the original business could go in and hijack a phone number to a competitor’s number, but, ironically, an online search in Google finds other examples. I contacted Google to ask about its security for business listings. Spokeswoman Elizabeth Davidoff tells me: “We’re always working on new and better ways to fight these [spamming] issues and keep our information up to date. But we tend not to share details behind our processes so as not to tip off these individuals.” Repair people are supposed to fix leaks, not make them. But this time, Stoneham left Grayson’s house with towels on the floor seeping up a leak from an ice maker he took apart. He said he’d come back and finish. He charged Grayson $1,225 to fix the freezer and the bar ice maker. She paid by check — before the work was done. Ouch. But she was getting ready for a family wedding and needed quick repairs. When Stoneham wrote an invoice, she noticed it didn’t say “C&W” so she asked him about it. He explained that he took jobs from C&W when they were overbooked, she said. Grayson looked outside to see if his vehicle carried a company name. It didn’t. “He didn’t drive a van. He drove a car that got into a couple of wrecks,” she recalls. Suspicious, she called the phone number on the Google listing again. It rang and rang, but no one picked up. That made no sense. She scrolled down further in the Google listings and saw a different number for C&W. She called it. That’s how she learned that C&W’s phone number on Google was hijacked by someone stealing its business. She spoke to C&W owner David Thompson, who said he lost another customer to Stoneham the same way, and a dozen others to other outsiders in the days his phone number was switched. Thompson told her Stoneham worked for his company 10 years ago but disappeared with a company vehicle that turned up later. He told her about Stoneham’s theft conviction and his questionable business practices. Grayson quickly stopped payment on Stoneham’s check. Stoneham called her to say he was returning to finish. Grayson called Dallas police. The C&W owner was on his way, too. It was like the climax of a bad movie. When everybody arrived, the officer listened to both sides and declared it a civil dispute. “Let him finish the job,” the officer said. The officer didn’t check Stoneham for outstanding warrants. He would have learned Stoneham owes at least $5,000 for active, mostly driving-related warrants in North Texas, including $2,000 in Fort Worth, $2,000 in Dallas and $900 in Plano. Good news Stoneham, to his credit, fixed both appliances. That’s huge. But his problems were far from over. The C&W owner waited outside to confront Stoneham about the hijacked phone number. When Stoneham exited, they exchanged words. “Basically, I communicated my displeasure,” Thompson says. “He told me to get out of his face, and I said, ‘I haven’t been there yet.’” Customer Grayson investigated how much the parts actually cost. She learned Stoneham, after charging for parts, marked up her bill another $900, presumably for labor. Because she had stopped payment, she held the upper hand. She offered Stoneham $550, which allowed $200 for labor. He got angry and threatened her with small claims court. This week, he changed his mind and accepted her $550. He talks On the phone this week, Stoneham tells The Watchdog that he doesn’t know about the phone hijacking. He does not take my questions. “I buy leads. That’s all I do,” he says. He cut his ties with the leads company because he “lost too much money on them.” At the leads company, Niko Volto of Appliance Repair Call Generation in San Jose, Calif., says he intends to cut ties with Stoneham because of these disputes. I ask, who hijacked the number? Volto guesses one of his affiliate marketers is the culprit, but he says he doesn’t know. The bottom line C&W owner Thompson says he learned businesses should check their phone numbers on Google’s business listings to prevent this. “Google blocked the email address where it came from, but they would not tell us who it was,” he says. “It’s identity theft.” Watchdog Nation tip: Don’t assume a phone number found through a search engine leads to the correct company. It wasn’t possible to change numbers in the old Yellow Pages, but in this brave new world, someone can do this and send a Michael Stoneham to your front door.   ABOUT THIS COLUMN The Watchdog Desk works for you to shine light on questionable practices in business and government.

Box 655237, Dallas, TX 75265   Google listings Here’s what Google spokeswoman Elizabeth Davidoff says about spammers who hijack a Google business listing from a legitimate business to steal customers. Q. How is it possible that someone can change a business’s phone number? Users can use the “suggest an edit” or “report a problem” tools to update business listing information. Users can then vote on whether the edit is accurate or not. Once enough votes are received to be confident that the suggestion is accurate, it’s published. We’re heavily invested in empowering users to contribute their local knowledge. Q. How big a problem is this? Overall, the process provides comprehensive and up-to-date info, but we recognize that there may be occasional inaccuracies or bad edits suggested by users. When this happens, we take immediate action to correct the information. Q. What is Google doing about it? Spammers and others with negative intent are a problem for consumers, businesses and technology companies that provide local business information. We’re always working on new and better ways to fight these issues and keep our information up to date. But we tend not to share details behind our processes so as not to tip off these individuals. Business owners can claim their business via Google My Business to manage their info. This is completely free, gives them more control over their business information, and offers them new ways to reach and connect with people on Google Search and Maps.

Join For Free Discover how to protect your applications from known and unknown vulnerabilities. When it comes to hacking, we usually think of breaking in to security systems and deviant acts related to stealing, deceit and con men. There are cases where the internet itself is problem, but it can also be a place for us to find a solution. Google does indeed (almost) have the answer to everything if you look hard enough, including how to deal with and identifying a hacking incident. Based on the Q3 Hacked website report by Sucuri it showed that WordPress gets about 74% hacked sites for Quarter 3 (Q3), although it decreases in Q3 we can see that it is still many in numbers.  The worst case scenario of hacking can lead to business data theft which also leads to loss of money. For this post we are going to feature a WordPress site which has been detected through the search console as a hacked site. Hacked Content Detected Last January 10, 2017, we discovered a message from Netizensreviews.com search console.  It’s particularly annoying if a site becomes a hacking victim, especially if we can see some malicious content injected in their page. Just take a look at below on the full message from the console. As a safety measure, Google keeps site owners up-to-date, so it is essential that you must connect your website with the search console as well. If your site has been hacked, you can receive a manual action (either site-wide or partial matches) where you will be informed if the site may not perform well in Google results since it violates the search engine’s webmaster guidelines. You truly have to make sure that you are frequently checking your search console messages. Once you perform a Google manual search, you will see this below. What’re the chances of your site getting some visitor lovin’ if it’s labeled with “This site maybe hacked”? How to Fix Here’s what we did to recover the hacked site: 1. Check Security Issues for the Details of the Hack In this site we haven’t seen any detected security issues, but we are advised to see resources for hacked sites and cross-site malware warning. 2. Find Out Why Your Website Has Been Hacked We have checked the whole site and found out the following details about why the site was hacked: Outdated Plug-ins– last update was on October 2014 and that’s why they have an easy access to the back door. As reported, we have read that there are 3 plug-ins which is the main reason for hacking: RevSlider, GravityForms, and TimThumb. According to sucupress, based on their clients’ statistics these are the following reason why a website was hacked: You don’t know what happened Your plug-in or theme is vulnerable to pirates There is a WordPress vulnerability due to its core flaws Host Provider Problems Have Old installation files Chmod fault or bad file permission Password theft Due to other reasons e.g. no anti-virus, responded to phishing mail, or have outdated servers or FTPs. 3. Be Sure to Check the Entire Site There might be other compromised pages or files which truly need to be checked. Sometimes these are hidden and might be placed in HTML, JavaScript or other files.  You can do a site check using Sucuri like so: You can also use sites to find hidden links which suggest doing a Google search. i.e: “home loan” site:netizensreviews.com” 4. Remove All Malicious Content In our case we have restored it using our older back up files. As Google suggested you can also contact your hosting provider for assistance. 5. Secure Your Website From Future Hacks or Attacks Now that you know the real reason why the site was hacked, it’s time to make those pages or material immune to future attacks. In our case we have make sure that the plug-ins are updated, including changing the password. Additionally, Google also suggests that you ask the help of your hosting provider. 6. Recheck Website After securing the site, it’s now time to make sure that no more malicious files have been injected. Recheck the site by doing a Google search or using sucuri.  After scanning, make sure no malware, website blacklisting, injected spam, or defacements are detected. You can also do a simple Google search by typing “site: [website URL]”. It’s considered clean if you can’t find any labels on it. Check using Safe Browsing Site Status. We can see that the site is no longer infected or dangerous. No more malicious files have been detected. Before filing up a reconsideration request make sure that you have answered Hacked sites Trouble Shooter. 7. Submit a Reconsideration Request After making sure that the site is now clean, submit the URL for a reconsideration request. After clicking the request a review button a text box will open which requests you to write the process on how you went about with your site clean-up. And fill it like: Hi, For netizens reviews, we have addressed it using restoring our older backed-up files and updating the plug-ins and password. We also make sure that the site is clean by using search operator, fetch as Google and even checked it using a third party tool. I am hoping that I can see a response from you soon. Thanks. 8. Check Updates for Request  If they have determined that your site is free from hacking, they will notify you that your reconsideration request was approved. In our case, we received it after two days. Conclusion Hacking is almost considered a “talent” for our generation. It seems like the general stereotype that those involved in comprehensive computer work are hackers is slowly becoming true. With their own twists, recent films like Nerve, Eagle Eye and Blackhat even tolerate the act of hacking. With just a few detailed steps though, your website can bounce back from a hack like it never happened. Remember, prevention is better than cure. Keep your sites well-maintained and protected – leave no room for hackers to wiggle through.

Picture: BLOOMBERG/KRISZTIAN BOCSI Alphabet Inc. warned investors about a slew of new competitors, highlighting the company’s broad expansion beyond its original Google search business. Alphabet named rivals including Apple, Netflix and Hulu, while highlighting risks from new businesses such as consumer hardware manufacturing, according to its latest annual report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Here are the top new competitive disclosures, gleaned from a comparison between Alphabet’s latest annual report and the filing from a year earlier: — "Providers of digital video services, such as Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu." Google’s YouTube has new paid subscription versions of its online video offering that compete more directly with the latter three companies. Executives were cautiously optimistic about this on an earnings call last week. "[It] takes a while to build a subscription business here," Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said. — "Digital assistant providers, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft." Last year, the company launched its Google Assistant, a voice-based information service that Google hopes to embed in as many devices as possible. That competes against Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana. Facebook has a similar service in its Messenger app. — "Providers of enterprise cloud services, including Amazon and Microsoft." This refers to Google’s cloud computing business, which executive Diane Greene is finally turning into a serious service for larger corporate customers. Alphabet mentioned the cloud in previous annual reports, but the focus on enterprise is new. — "Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer electronics products." This likely refers to Google’s new suite of gadgets, including the Pixel phone and Home speaker. The phone makes it a rival to Apple, and Android device makers like Samsung Electronics. Speaking of hardware, Alphabet’s latest annual report highlighted new manufacturing and supply-chain risks related to its in-house gadget push. "We may enter into long term contracts that commit us to significant terms and conditions of supply. We may be liable for material and product that is not consumed due to market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues," the company wrote. Alphabet also disclosed the cost of marketing these new devices to potential buyers. Total sales and marketing expenses increased by more than $1.4bn from 2015 to 2016 — mainly due to a $679m jump in advertising and promotional costs for Google’s hardware products, the filing said.

How To Use Google's Secret 'Testing On The Toilet' Philosophy To Your Advantage Logan Booker Feb 5, 2017, 3:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories google programming Share Image: Douglas Muth / Flickr Sometimes it can be hard to get little snippets of information to stick in your head, be they procedures for common workplace tasks, to correctly testing complex code. This is a fact Google recognised over ten years ago and one of its remedies was something the company calls "Testing on the Toilet". Don't worry, it's not as weird as it sounds. All the way back in 2007, Google revealed "Testing on the Toilet", an approach to employee education that "inspire[s] our developers to write well-tested code": ...although you've read the books and heard the lectures, maybe you need a little more inspiration, tips, and prodding. And you need it to be in a place where when you see it, you can't ignore it ... We write flyers about everything from dependency injection to code coverage, and then regularly plaster the bathrooms all over Google with each episode, almost 500 stalls worldwide. The original post goes on to say that Google would regularly post these "TotT" episodes to its blog. Indeed it did and continues to do so. Now, there are two ways you can use TotT for yourself. Firstly, you can grab the PDF versions of Google's TotT episodes and plaster them around your office toilets. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that won't work for the majority of people, unless you happen to work at a massive, Google-like developer. The second, more practical way is to create your own episodes (or posters), so to speak, that are more relevant to your workplace and put them in places where they can't be ignored. Of course, you'll want to get your colleagues and boss onboard, as going rogue with this sort of thing is unlikely to go down well. The end result should hopefully be better recall of these important factoids. At the very least, it'll give your workmates something productive to read on the loo.

Picture: Reuters A U.S. judge has ordered Google to comply with search warrants seeking customer emails stored outside the United States, diverging from a federal appeals court that reached the opposite conclusion in a similar case involving Microsoft Corp. U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. The judge said this was because there was “no meaningful interference” with the account holder’s “possessory interest” in the data sought. “Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,” Rueter wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc, said in a statement on Saturday: “The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants.” The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that U.S. investigators sought in a narcotics case. That decision last July 14 was welcomed by dozens of technology and media companies, privacy advocates, and both the American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On Jan. 24, the same appeals court voted not to revisit the decision. The four dissenting judges called on the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns. Both cases involved warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law that many technology companies and privacy advocates consider outdated. In court papers, Google said it sometimes breaks up emails into pieces to improve its network’s performance, and did not necessarily know where particular emails might be stored. Relying on the Microsoft decision, Google said it believed it had complied with the warrants it received, by turning over data it knew were stored in the United States. Google receives more than 25,000 requests annually from U.S. authorities for disclosures of user data in criminal matters, according to Rueter’s ruling. The cases are In re: Search Warrant No. 16-960-M-01 to Google and In re: Search Warrant No. 16-1061-M to Google, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Nos. 16-mj-00960, 16-mj-01061. -Reuters mboneni RELATED ARTICLES International business Struggling retailers seek silver bullet in Amazon era International business Robots take pride of place at the Vitra Design Museum International business Tata Steel agrees deal to sell UK assets International business Nissan says Mexico plant going ahead despite Trump warnings International business Hyundai Heavy swings back to black NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Think again US court decides Google must cough up emails held abroad 4 Feb 2017 at 00:42, Iain Thomson The US Department of Justice will be happy campers this weekend. A court in Pennsylvania has ruled that Google must obey domestic search warrants for data stored overseas. In other words, Google has to hand over to the FBI suspects' email regardless of where it is held. The ad giant had previously refused to comply with two court orders. The timing of this ruling is rather interesting. Last month, Microsoft won a crucial privacy battle in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in a similar case. Microsoft was ordered to hand over emails stored on cloud systems in Ireland to American investigators probing drugs trafficking. The Windows giant refused to comply, bagged a landmark appeal, and is able to take the matter all the way to the US Supreme Court. Specifically, Microsoft was served a Stored Communications Act (SCA) warrant by a court in New York. The corporation successfully argued that US investigators should have gone to the Irish authorities to request access to files on the Irish servers. The DoJ's lawyers saw it another way: that Microsoft is an American corporation and thus must always yield to American courts. On Friday, in a separate case, a district court in eastern Pennsylvania ruled that Google must obey two SCA search warrant and cough up emails stored overseas to the Feds. The judge's decision [PDF] is seemingly at odds with the appeals court: it doesn't matter that Google distributes its file systems across the world, it's still an American corporation. And that means an American court can order it to give up customers' private information. "Google regularly transfers user data from one data center to another without the customer's knowledge," said Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter. "Such transfers do not interfere with the customer's access or possessory interest in the user data. Even if the transfer interferes with the account owner's control over his information, this interference is de minimis and temporary." The judge said the requested messages would only be opened in the US, so it wasn't, in his opinion, a foreign search and thus it falls under US jurisdiction: the search warrants pursue suspects living in America, it was noted. "The court suggests that bringing a file back to the United States is not a seizure because Google moves data around all the time and 'this interference is de minimis and temporary'," said Professor Orin Kerr of the George Washington University Law School. "I don't think that works. Google is a private company not regulated by the Fourth Amendment, so whether it moves around data is irrelevant. And I don't see what is 'de minimis and temporary' about the government ordering Google to make a copy of your email pursuant to a court order." He concluded: "It certainly may be a reasonable seizure, but I think it’s still a Fourth Amendment seizure." In a statement on Saturday, a Google spokesperson said: "The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on over-broad warrants." ® Tips and corrections 83 Comments More from The Register God save the Queen... from Donald Trump.

The Mountain View giant announced the bad news early this week alongside its call for users to upgrade their Chrome to the latest version of the browser.  On the G Suite Updates blog, the team behind the web-based e-mail service stated that Windows XP and Windows Vista users will be most affected by its move. Apparently, the dated Windows platforms only support Chrome browser v49 because XP and Vista are no longer maintained by Microsoft. The Redmond-based tech company announced back in 2015 that it was abandoning the two platforms.  Because Windows XP and Windows Vista only have support for v49 of Chrome, they will not be able to load or open the updated Gmail interface. Google’s browser is currently on version 55. The latest version has very important security updates and on top of that it is very different from v49. Thus, Google is encouraging users who are still using v53 and below to upgrade to v55 as soon as possible.  Related Stories Google Chrome For iOS Now Lets You Scan QR Codes Without Using Another App Google Sets Up $4 Million Immigration Crisis Fund After Trump Ban Android 7.0 Nougat Successor Taking Center Stage At Google I/O 2017 Google warns that users who will not update their browser to the latest version will be vulnerable to attacks. The security updates can prevent these attacks. Also, the latest version comes with new features and bug fixes. For people who will not be updating this year, they will still have access to Gmail. However, when December 2017 comes, they will only be able to load the basic HTML version of the service.  For Windows XP and Windows Vista users, Deccan Chronicle recommends upgrading to a newer operating system. Of course, if they wish to continue using the platforms, they can just rely on third-party browsers when accessing Gmail. However, the news site says there is no guarantee that these third-party browsers can keep the users’ Gmail account safe.  Google is serious in promoting Chrome browser v55. Hence, starting Feb. 8, users who have not updated their browser to the latest version will see a banner on top of their Gmail interface. The banner will be there to encourage and inform users of the need to upgrade to the up-to-date version of Chrome.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

 MIT and Google designed a cubicle that comes down from the ceiling for open offices Leanna Garfield Feb. 2, 2017, 12:12 PM 4,984 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Transformable Meeting Space. MIT Self-Assembly Lab/Google/Michelle Kaufmann Like many companies, Google has opted for an open layout in its Silicon Valley headquarters.  But since there are no cubicles, it can be hard to find a quiet space to get work done or to conduct important phone calls. To solve this issue, Google, MIT, and architect Michelle Kaufmann designed a giant cubicle, called the Transformable Meeting Space, that comes down from the ceiling.  By maneuvering a lightweight pulley, people can make the Transformable Meeting Space wrap around them. It measures about 10 feet in diameter. "We were going after the challenge of office environments, where there are totally open spaces. They were trendy, but now there's a bit of a backlash on them," MIT's Skylar Tibbits tells Business Insider. "It's great because you can have privacy in fixed offices; but it's also not great, because you can't have flexibility or different functions." He's the founder of MIT's Self-Assembly Lab, which created the Transformable Meeting Space and experiments with "4D materials" that can transform, adapt, and assemble entirely by themselves. In December 2016, Tibbits published a book that details the impact and future of 4D technology. 4D materials aren't robotic. They use natural elements — like changes in temperature, pressure, and moisture — to transform or even repair themselves.  The Transformable Meeting Space. MIT Self-Assembly Lab/Google/Michelle Kaufmann Tibbits compares the Transformable Meeting Space to a Chinese finger trap because of the way that it morphs. The counter-weights help change the shape of the structure, which is made primarily of braided fiber glass and partially blocks outside noise. Its frame changes shape like a puppet, just by pulling a few ropes. MIT's Self-Assembly team is working on all kinds of similar projects. It has also built a system for cell phone parts that can self-assemble, orthodontic braces that can automatically move teeth, and an Ikea-style table that can build itself in a few seconds. The Lab collaborates with companies from various industries, including medicine, aerospace, and automotive, to create these systems. Tibbits sees them as cost-effective alternatives to traditional robotics. "Today, if companies want to make something smart, they tend to just turn it into a robot," he says. "The problem is that costs a lot, it fails often, it adds assembly time, and complexity." These materials could make manufacturing more efficient in coming years, especially in consumer electronics. In the case of the self-building cell phone, the device's magnetic parts bounce around in a tumbler. Almost like magic, the pieces find each other to form the cell phone without human intervention. The Transformable Meeting Space was one of the more mechanical prototypes the team has designed. "It doesn't need temperature or moisture or sunlight to activate it, but it geometrically transforms," Tibbits says.

The case is certain to spark a fight, because an appeals court ruled in favour of Microsoft in a similar case recently. Photo: Getty According to Reuters: US Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. The judge said this was because there was "no meaningful interference" with the account holder's "possessory interest" in the data sought. "Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centres abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States," Rueter wrote. Google was betting on a January 24 ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that it would not rehear the Justice Department's arguments for why it needed access to user data from Microsoft's servers located in Ireland. Many believed that decision might create some legal guidance for cases like this one in which the laws on the books are considered outdated and insufficient. The legal language of "possessory interest", for example, is often used to define temporary ownership over real estate. Attempting to determine ownership over abstract property in the form of data isn't easy with the current legal system. In the ruling against Google, Judge Rueter is arguing that even though "the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centres abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States." It's unclear if that decision means that evidence from a foreign server would be a violation of privacy if disclosed in a US court of law. Clarity is what tech companies and privacy advocates have been pushing for over the years. Both the Microsoft and Google cases relied on warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act from 1986. A lot has changed about the flow of information since then and in a globalized world, tech giants have to work with competing international privacy laws. If Judge Rueter's opinion stands, it could put the US in violation of international treaties. In the Microsoft case, Judge Susan L. Carney even wrote that this is an issue that needs to be taken care of by Congress, writing: "We recognise at the same time that in many ways the [Stored Communications Act] has been left behind by technology. It is overdue for a congressional revision that would continue to protect privacy but would more effectively balance concerns of international comity with law enforcement needs and service provider obligations in the global context in which this case arose." Google argued that because it stores pieces of emails on different servers in order to streamline its network performance, it might not even know where the information that's being requested is actually stored. The search giant released a statement today saying, "The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants." These types of cases will either have to make their way to the Supreme Court or Congress will have to act. With the chaotic state of the US government at the moment, it's impossible to say how either of those options might work out. [Reuters, TechCrunch] Comments djbear @djbear Feb 5, 2017, 6:35pm If the emails are not stored on US soil, The US court system has no right to demand google hands over the emails. Reply 0 Swiften Guest Feb 6, 2017, 8:45am The US has long declared that they have every right to do whatever they want. They also seem to take offense at the idea of other countries sovereignty. Reply 2 micky watts Guest Feb 6, 2017, 12:38pm In foreign relations one rule reigns supreme: might is right. Problem is, when you play by that rule you encourage and open the door for rivals to do the same, which can lead down the path to serious conflict. Reply 0 ok @ok Feb 6, 2017, 1:53pm The case is certain to spark a fight, because an appeals court ruled in favour of Microsoft in a similar case recently. Seems like a double standard - i'm not fully aware of the intricate details regarding Microsoft's case, but from what I understand, these emails were stored in Dublin... how's that any different? Granted, I don't condone criminal activity, but if people were smarter, they'd use PGP, password protected attachments or avoid email altogether and use secure messaging tools, ie: Signal. Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d Feb 6, 2017, 4:26pm All the more reason to avoid Globalised companies and stick with local service providers which are forced to abide by local law and not foreign interest.

It’s been another busy week across the tech world, with all sorts of official announcements, exciting leaks and intriguing insights. As ever, 7 Days is here to make sure you know what’s been going on, walking you through the week’s biggest developments. Tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft reacted to President Donald Trump's ban on traveling to the United States from seven different countries. Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith also took the time to reassure employees that they're a top priority for the company. But if you are visiting the United States, you might end up having to turn over your social media and web browsing history; in fact, General John Kelly confirmed it. Alphabet-owned Boston Dynamics revealed some new robots that are on wheels, rather than the usual two or four legs. Now, Skynet will be able to take us to the machine apocalypse in style. Google's Chrome browser for iOS has now been added to the Chromium open-source repository. Due to restrictions that Apple has in place, the browser is built on WebKit, so by making it open-source, the company is hoping for some community contributions. LG's upcoming Android Wear 2.0 device, the Watch Style, got another leak this week. It's expected to be priced at $249. Razer, the company that makes gaming PCs and accessories, bought Nextbit, the company that made a cloud-cased Android phone. Nextbit will continue to operate independently. ZTE just can't win with its crowd-funded phone, the Hawkeye. It seems that the company will be planning to redesign the device and start a new campaign. Xiaomi's Redmi Pro 2 specs leaked. It's expected to have two models: one with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, and another with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. Image via Business Insider LG's upcoming G6 showed up in another leak this week, this time showing the rear casing of the handset. It appears to have a similar design to the V20, but with a glossy back, possibly made of glass. Samsung has begun sending out invitations for an event at Mobile World Congress. The company is expected to launch the Galaxy Tab S3, rather than the Galaxy S8. Samsung Pay Mini is coming to compatible Android phones. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually offer direct mobile payments. If you're wondering just how durable Huawei's Honor 6X is, it was put through its paces this week. As you can see, the device succumbed to the pressure. The good news is that if you have one, it will get Android Nougat and EMUI 5 next month. T-Mobile has begun testing Nougat for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the update has been rolling out to variants of both handsets for a while. Google announced the next maintenance update of Android, which is 7.1.2 Nougat. The only front-facing feature is that it will bring fingerprint gestures to some older devices, like the Nexus 5X. Unfortunately, the Nexus 6 and 9 will be retired from mainstream support when this update is released; however, they will continue to receive security updates. This shouldn't shock you, as Google didn't guarantee updates after October, 2016. NuAns is teasing a new handset, which will likely be the successor to its Windows 10 Mobile phone, the Neo. It doesn't seem likely that it will use Windows though, given that the President has expressed dissatisfaction with the OS. Whatever it is, we'll find out on February 20. Microsoft updated its Authenticator app on iOS and Android, and it now includes a new feature called phone sign-in. Instead of only working for two-factor authentication, you can use the app instead of your password. Microsoft held its NexTech event in Nairobi, Kenya. Neowin's own Managing Editor Andy Weir was there, where the company launched the Insiders4Good East Africa Fellowship. The company's market value hit $500 billion for the first time in over 15 years. The last time that it was that high was in March, 2000, when it had an all-time high of $550 billion. And things are looking good for the firm's products. Windows 10 is now above 25% usage share, according to NetMarketShare, and Edge saw an increase in browser usage as well. Image via Dirror You can now get a mirror that's powered by Windows 10. It will empower you to achieve more while you're combing your hair in the morning and taking that bathroom selfie. Acer has a new ultrawide monitor, which comes in at a whopping $1,300. While it comes in at 1440p, it supports AMD's FreeSync technology. Announced at CES, HP's EliteBook x360 is out. The base model is $2,349 and includes 4GB RAM and 128GB of storage, but it's made for businesses and includes a number of high-end security features. The company's Elite x3 handset got a firmware update this week. It contains a number of fixes for the camera, performance, stability, and more. The Instagram app for Windows 10 Mobile got updated twice this week. The first one added Boomerang support, and the second one allows you to save photos. Listings for Microsoft's Lumia line of Windows phones have been disappearing from first-party retailers, and in fact, Cricket Wireless now sells none of them. It does have one Lumia though, the Nokia-branded Lumia 635. Microsoft, on the other hand, has added back almost all of the listings that it took down. These include the Lumia 650, AT&T-locked Lumia 640 XL, Acer Jade Primo, and additional color options for the Lumia 950 and 950 XL. The Surface 3 is finally dead. After Microsoft repeatedly said during its earnings call that it's phasing out the tablet in favor of the Pro 4 and the Book, the device has been removed from the Microsoft Store. Speaking of older Surface devices, the Pro 3 received a firmware update this week with display and Miracast improvements. There was quite a bit of news on the Windows Insider Program front. Build 15025 was released for PC and Mobile on separate days, and than we got ISO images of the PC build. There's also an SDK Preview build of 15021. PC build 15025 new features PC build 15025 fixes and known issues PC build 15025 ISOs Mobile build 15025 new features Mobile build 15025 fixes and known issues SDK Preview build 15021 If you're interested, the final Bug Bash for the Creators Update has kicked off, but you'll need to be on build 15025 to participate. A new Office Insider build was released for Windows devices. The January update includes a few new features, such as the ability to manipulate objects with a pen, a Visio Add-in, and more. Build 15023 for the Xbox One was released to the Preview Alpha ring earlier this week. It contained only fixes; however, it was also the first build that the Preview Beta ring received, so for those Insiders, there's a lot more that's new. Also, Microsoft changed the way that the Xbox Insider Program works. If you're selected to join the Alpha ring, you can now choose which of your consoles are enrolled. Three more Xbox 360 games have been added to Xbox One Backward Compatibility, bringing the total to 328. These include Juju, Mad Tracks, and Stuntman: Ignition. 343 Industries will be holding a livestream event for the launch of Halo Wars 2, and the company also teased some poster art. Another upcoming game is Fallout Shelter, which, while having been available on iOS and Android, will be coming to Xbox One and Windows 10 as an Xbox Play Anywhere title on February 7. Microsoft announced two new Xbox Wireless Controllers, both of which will be available on Tuesday for $69.99. The one on the left is Dawn Shadow, and the one on the right is Winter Forces. Alex Kipman talked about the possibility of a HoloLens that costs less than $1,000. It's a long way off, but it's a problem that Microsoft will need to solve to bring it to a mass market, given that the current units cost $3,000. Microsoft released a video from its WinHEC conference in December, where it told OEMs what kind of devices it wants them to build. It's no surprise, as there's an emphasis on 2-in-1s, all-in-ones, ultrabooks, and gaming rigs, as well as pens, Windows Hello, and far-field speech recognition. The company also outlined new features that are coming to Edge in the Creators Update, which include ebook reading, better tab management, and more. There's also WebRTC, which is in the latest Insider Preview build. Perhaps most interesting is an app called Interop Unlock Tools, which shows off Project Neon, the upcoming design language in Windows 10. If you want to check it out, you'll need build 15019 or better, and you'll have to sideload it. Dropbox finally released its competitor to the now-deprecated OneDrive placeholders - formally known as Project Infinite - to business customers. Luckily, Smart Sync will be coming to consumers as well. But while there's good news for Dropbox customers, it's not so great on the OneDrive side. If you're one of the users that got unlimited or 10TB storage after Microsoft promised it, that will be taken away on March 1, and we now know what will happen to your account. And then there's Windows 10 Cloud. Going into the week, we had never heard about it and now, we know everything we can without having an official announcement of the OS. First, references to it appeared in build 15019. Then, it was reported that 10 Cloud would be a version of Windows that only ran apps from the Store, similar to Windows RT. Screenshots of build 15019 leaked, and then Windows 10 Cloud build 15025 itself leaked. Epic Games co-founder Tim Sweeney even chimed in to call it 'Windows 10 Crush Steam Edition'. We've also learned that it will be upgradeable to a full version of Windows, presumably at a cost. Microsoft rolled out another update to Visual Studio 2017 RC. There are a few new features, such as .NET Core and ASP.NET Core coming out of preview. Also, Samsung released a second preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. The company also announced the Git Virtual File System (GVFS), which has former Insider Program head Gabe Aul on the project. Build 2017 registration is open as well; however, you'll need an RSVP code, and it will cost $2,195. The event will be in Seattle from May 10 - 12. The company launched Add-ins for iOS this week, which have long been available on Windows and can also be used by Insiders using macOS. Support for the feature is also coming to Android soon, and while there isn't a timeline, Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft Teams is now being used by 30,000 different organizations. This spans across 145 different markets and it's in 19 languages. The firm is killing off some older versions of Skype on macOS and Windows. If you're on Windows, you'll need to have a version number that's better than 7.16, and for Mac, 7.18. A Cortana beta program is coming for iOS. Microsoft is looking for 1,000 testers, so you may have missed your chance already. In the new iOS 10.3 beta, Apple has begun giving out warnings that 32-bit apps will no longer work in future versions of the OS. Presumably, the warnings are speaking of iOS 11, and it suggests that 32-bit devices will not work with the updated operating system, such as the iPhone 5, 5c, and fourth-generation iPad. Speaking of iPhones, Apple may begin manufacturing some of them in India. This would allow the company to expand its retail operations there. The first watchOS 3.2 Developer Beta was released, and it brings a couple interesting features. The new Theater Mode will allow you to set your Apple Watch so that it won't light up in a movie theater, and it also supports SiriKit. Hey, remember when Facebook wanted to buy Snapchat for $3 billion and the company turned it down? Well, Snap Inc. is now launching a $3 billion IPO. Nintendo's NES Classic sold 1.5 million units since it launched, globally. The retro console has been sold out everywhere since it came out, rarely getting back in stock. In fact, some might find it surprising that 1.5 million units existed at all. Clearly, if the company had managed its supply chain a bit better, it could have had a much more lucrative holiday season. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Image via Max Alexander This week in science is a new weekly feature on Neowin, written by Gabriel Nunes. Every week, he'll discuss the most interesting scientific achievements and discussions during that period. Timi Cantisano published a review of Huawei's Mate 9. giving it an 8.5 out of 10. The only cons to the device were some issues with the camera. Timi reviewed Samsung's Gear S3 classic as well, also giving it an 8.5. While design, battery life, and Samsung Pay are all positive aspects, and cons are the app ecosystem and the price. Unfortunately, the iDeaUSA V201 headphones didn't fare so well, with Timi awarding them 6 points out of 10. They weren't too comfortable to wear, and the sound quality isn't great. Steven Johns wrote up a review of the Dodocool Solar Power Bank, giving it a 7 out of 10. The big negative side to this one is, you guessed it, that it only charges in the sun. Since the deadline for chopping down Office 365 users' OneDrive storage to 1TB is fast approaching, I wrote about some handy tips that might help to ease you through the transition. Finally, in case you're interested in Microsoft's unannounced, leaked Windows 10 Cloud build, I made a hands on video showing it off. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with more news, all sorts of updates, and lots of juicy rumors from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend...

Google vs. Apple: Which Maps App Should You be Using? Bethany Cleg Photographer, Entrepreneur Share More Tweet Share Save Share Stumble Email Google vs. Apple: Which Maps App Should You be Using? Bethany Cleg Photographer, Entrepreneur | If you’re an everyday maps user, you’ll know that this technology is crucial to your daily commute. In the past few years, technology has becoming an increasingly popular addition to the driving experience. From the ever-popular online driving courses to digital maps, technology has changed the face of driving forever. That’s why Apple’s release of its own map app has caused such an upset. Beginning with the iOS 6, Apple phones will no longer have Google Maps but will feature Apple’s own map application. Shortly after this development, Google announced an update to its own maps to keep things competitive. This raises one important question: which map is the best? Public Transportation While Apple is marketing a different product, it seems that they have taken a couple of pages from Google. Apple’s map features a turn-by-turn navigation style that is identical to Google’s. The application also uses a traffic viewer to help users see faster routes and uses traffic reports to change routes that have slowed due to traffic. While all of these features are nice, they are also the standard that Google Maps has set. One thing that Apple lacks, however, is an option for travel by public transportation. This is a large weakness that alienates a large section of Apple’s urban audience, so why did they choose not to include it? Well, most cities offer their public transportation routes through GTFS, or General Transit Data Feed. While this service is completely free to use, it was also engineered by Google, which is likely why Apple will not be using it in their own application. Siri Apple should get a leg up on Google thanks to Siri, right? Siri is able to provide users with information like where to find nearby restaurants or gas stations as well as an estimated time of arrival. While Siri has become a popular feature of Apple products, it functions very much like a normal GPS in this regard. While Siri is a solid addition to Apple’s map application, it does not do much more than any other GPS app on the market. Nearby Search Both Google and Apple have a feature that allows users to look up local restaurants and businesses near them. Apple does have a particular edge in this area, though. Apple’s search not only shows the basic results, it also includes Yelp reviews. This means that Apple users can read reviews of various restaurants before deciding to go anywhere, which is a major plus in terms of convenience. Bird’s Eye View The newest innovation has been for map applications to offer a bird’s eye view of a location. Google recently added what it calls “Tour Guide,” while Apple refers to its program as “3D Flyover.” In short, these features do virtually the same thing. They offer a view of a location from above to help in navigating the area. There is a slight performance difference in Apple’s favor, however. Apple’s 3D Flyover offers much more intense details than Google’s Tour Guide, and the images are created in real-time without sacrificing stunning visual details. Given Apple’s history, it is no surprise that the company has an edge here. In the past three years, Apple took over several mapping companies, two of which specialized in 3D modeling. With these new acquisitions, it is logical that they would offer a better 3D service than Google. Final Verdict It is impossible to deny that Apple took a lot of the amazing features from Google Maps without really altering them at all. From turn-by-turn navigation to classic search features, Apple functions in much the same way as any traditional GPS application. There are some differences, however, and they are worth taking note of. By not including public transportation, Apple’s map feature will likely be far less useful than Google Maps to users who live in large cities. On the flip side, there are other areas in which Apple excels. Apple’s 3D rendering of a landscape is ideal for anybody planning any kind of road trip and offers far superior navigation compared with Google’s. For this reason, Apple wins among consumers who find themselves traveling a lot. Each application has strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately the victor is decided by personal preference and unique user needs.

Gigjets Technology Gaming Computers Phones Software and Apps Tablets Connect With Us: X Search this site: Search for: X Navigate Here: Sitemap X Home » Software and Apps » Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P To Feature Google Assistant Improvements Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P To Feature Google Assistant Improvements By Wayne Westerberg / February 3, 2017 / Software and Apps No Comments on Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P To Feature Google Assistant Improvements 167 Last year marks the date when Google decided to venture in to the smartphone world by itself with the Pixel lineup. It’s safe to say that this was a good decision, profits wise. Both Pixel and the larger Pixel XL have been quite successful in terms of sales. Pixel XL is actually considered as being the best smartphone to be launched during 2016. There are many factors to why these smartphones sold so well, and one of them is that both feature Google’s artificial intelligence assistant. Google Assistant is certainly a key selling point to Pixel and Pixel XL. Google optimized the AI to the point that users can control their devices only through vocal commands. This was to be expected though, since Apple has been using a virtual assistant for a while now. What’s interesting is that even though this feature was brought by Android Nougat, Nexus devices didn’t receive it. This raised many concerns among Google’s fans. The Android parent actually received a lot of criticism for the way it handled this situation. The reason behind this is that everyone believes that the reason why Google didn’t provide Nexus devices with the virtual assistant is to make the Pixel devices more appealing towards customers. Well, according to rumors this might change. A couple of days ago, Google rolled out its latest Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta update. This update has been regarded as being focused only on stabilizing the operating system but as everyone soon found  out, it includes some extra features. Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P users will be able to enjoy fingerprint gestures support from now on. Android 7.1.2 Nougat is still in beta and this means that things might change along the way. Rumor has it that Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P will receive Google Assistant in the full version of the update. Additionally, some are speculating that Android 8.0 will actually be the update that’s going to include the virtual assistant. Nonetheless, we can only hope that these rumors are proven to be true. Especially since everyone believes that Google is slowly but surely trying to get rid of the Nexus brand.   Related Tagged as: Google, Google Assitant, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P Recommended stories you may like: Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P Finally Gets New Improvements Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P To Come With Google’s Artificial Intelligence Assistant Google Is Putting Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P Up To Par With Pixel Smartphones Samsung Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Tab S3 February Security Patch Available Nexus Firewall Comes as the Best Defense for Software Developers Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P to Receive Google Assistant Nexus 6P Available with N4F26O Android 7.1.1 Nougat Update Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will not come with Android 7.1.2 Nougat Beta Update Nexus 6P Soon Available with February Security Update Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P to Receive Pixel-Exclusive Feature Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P To Receive Fingerprint Gestures Nexus 5X and 6P expected to receive Google Assistant Nexus 5X Is Indeed Running Sailfish OS Google Update to Integrate Progressive Web Apps within Android Google Nexus 6 Wasn’t Supposed To Happen?

These two smartphones are quite successful, both in terms of sales and ratings. In fact, Pixel XL is considered as being the best all around smartphone to be launched during 2016. Both Pixel devices have many key selling points, but one of the most important ones is that they feature fingerprint gestures support. This feature was included alongside Android 7.0 Nougat during 2016. Even though Pixel and Pixel XL received fingerprint gestures support, none of the Nexus devices did. This raised a lot of controversy among Google’s fans. Many believed that this was just a marketing scheme from Google that’s meant to get Nexus users to switch to a more expensive Pixel device. When fans started criticizing Google, the Android parent stated that it’s still “testing” the feature for Nexus devices. Well, it looks like Google wasn’t lying because Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta includes fingerprint gestures support for Nexus 5X. This is a neat little feature to have. It has many uses, for example users can just swipe down on their fingerprint sensor and access their notifications panel. What we don’t know right now is if Nexus 6P will receive the same treatment. Right now, Nexus 6P isn’t eligible to download Google’s latest operating system update. We need to assure Nexus 6P users that this is going to change during the upcoming days, as confirmed by Google. Taking in consideration that Nexus 6P is better than Nexus 5X, we think it’s safe to say that Android 7.1.2 Nougat will also provide Nexus 6P with fingerprint gesture support. Worth mentioning is that this update can received OTA (over the air) only by Android users who are registered in Google’s Android Beta Program. Additionally, the OTA files for Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta can be downloaded from Google’s official Android website and side loaded manually. Nonetheless, this software update is still in its beta phase and we can expect the Android parent to include some additional features to it along the way. Also worth mentioning is that this updated is actually focused more towards stabilizing the operating system.

Google Nexus 6 Wasn’t Supposed To Happen? By Christopher McCandles / February 3, 2017 / Software and Apps No Comments on Google Nexus 6 Wasn’t Supposed To Happen? 210 Google recently launched its “own-made” Pixel lineup. Both Pixel and the larger Pixel XL are considered as being the most popular smartphones right now. Sadly, the arrival of Pixel and Pixel XL means that Google will be slowly but surely leaving all the Nexus devices behind. While the latest Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X are safe, we cannot say the same about the others. In fact, Google just confirmed that it has stopped supporting Nexus 6 and Nexus 9. Regarding Nexus 6, this smartphone has quite an interesting story. Google teamed up with Motorola back in November, 2014 and launched the device. What many might not know is that Nexus 6 wasn’t even supposed to be branded as a Nexus device. An official Motorola employee recently unveiled that Google had other plans for Nexus 6. The original plan for Nexus 6 was to brand it as Moto S and launch add it to the Android Silver Program. Well, this plan went to ruin when the head of Android Silver program decided to resign. As a result of that, many devices didn’t even see the light of day. Nexus 6 was the only lucky one to be actually put on the market. With that being said, Google didn’t start mass producing Nexus 6 right away and only manufactured a couple thousand units. Nexus 6 unexpectedly ran out of stock. Seeing this, Google and Motorola quickly started producing more units so that they could capitalize Nexus 6’s popularity. Nonetheless, we can only wonder what would have happened if the head of the Android Silver program wouldn’t have left. Undoubtedly we would have seen another Nexus 6, maybe manufactured by another tech company other than Motorola. As previously mentioned, Google recently confirmed that it has stopped supporting Nexus 6. This shouldn’t come as a surprise since the smartphone has passed its two year milestone. The reason its age matters so much is because Google stops rolling out software updates to devices that have reached the two year milestone. Worth mentioning is that the Android parent will actually keep providing Nexus 6 users with monthly security updates all throughout 2017 and that’s quite important since the internet is filled with malicious software.

ISSN 2330-717X Home News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology Health A New Front In The War On Payday Lenders – OpEd A Payday loan store in Texas. Photo by Aliman Senai, Wikimedia Commons. By MISES February 5, 2017 By Alice Salles* “Big Corporation helps government regulators crush poor people.” This is a headline fit for a series on the current war against making loans to low-income borrowers — although we’ll never see it framed this way by The Washington Post or The New York Times. But this is exactly what’s happened with payday loans as Google has joined government regulators in an effort to get rid of the payday loan industry and keep low-income working individuals from having access to cash lenders. After all, it seems evil capitalists in the payday lending industry are offering loans at higher interest rates — loans the poor would otherwise have no access to at all. According to Zero Hedge, Google has been working around the clock to combat “fake news,” a new category of information big media and established politicians have invented to attack news organizations that fail to spread the official narrative. As part of this war on “fake news,” Google banned “predatory” ads as well, disabling five million payday loan ads in the last months of 2016. This new policy of course helps both government regulators and established bankers who now are subject to less competition from small payday loan firms. As someone who has used payday loans in my days of struggling with little income in Hollywood — and when no bank would help — I find it incredible that, in 2017, people don’t know better. Why Rates for Payday Loans Are Higher In a late 2016 article, Jonathan Lee explained that short-term lenders charge higher interest rates because they are taking on a big risk when they lend money to low-income borrowers. Some of these borrowers don’t have a credit history or even a bank account. Lee explained how payday lenders fill a real need: [P]olicymakers are thinking with their hearts while sitting in their air-conditioned offices, away from the facts and any form of interaction with the real world of short-term loans. Just the fact that they see the short-term loan industry as “dirty” supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative… Studies show these lenders charge on average 15 percent, or $15 for every $100 loaned — a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets. Nevertheless, federal regulators think the industry is too profitable, and argue that regulators should “solve for ‘balloon payments,’” by “requir[ing] that most products become installment loans with smaller, manageable payments.” The problem with this statement is that the Bureau completely ignores the reason why short-term loans are so available to borrowers &mdash ’s because short-term loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow. Simply put, the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow. Additionally, making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model, making short-term lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency. By ignoring the need for firms willing to take the a risk on low-income borrowers, regulators — and Google — ignore the payday lenders’ importance. Not only because the low-income community has no standing with big banks, but because the payday firms serve to educate the individual. For those who have been in a low-income situation, however, the need for quick, easy loans is apparent. When I needed access to a loan quickly, I am glad I had a payday loan in my neighborhood. I needed the money then and there and I got it, but most importantly, I was truly happy the lenders imposed incentives to pay it all back. Which is what happened. Life can be hard at times. And many people need any help they can get. And, they often need help fast. Conventional banks simply don’t offer these services. Google is a private company and is entitled to decide for themselves who can work with them as advertisers. However, by working with regulators to attempt to put payday lenders out of business, Google is only working to further limit access to loans for low-income households, and making life even harder than it needs to be.

In case your Nougat experience has been buggy, these are the most frequently reported issues, and steps you can take to fix them. Image: Google Android, unlike iOS, is installed on a whole range of handsets with a variety of skins and add-ons installed, so it's not as easy to prescribe specific solutions. That said, there are a few general principles you can follow first, before you get in touch with your handset maker or network operator directly. Increased battery drain Image: Screenshot This is one of most frequently reported problems by early Nougat adopters, and also one of the most difficult issues to pin down, because there are so many potential causes — from a poorly made apps to a phone showing its age. Aside from just waiting for better battery optimization for your device to arrive in the next software update, the troubleshooting steps are the same as they would be on any other version of Android. Try uninstalling apps one by one to see if the issue clears up, or as a last resort try a factory reset (having backed up all your data first). The factory images are available direct from Google for Pixel and Nexus devices if you want to take that route. Image: Screenshot If you'd rather not uninstall and reinstall apps or wipe the whole operating system, you can dim your display brightness, reduce the screen lock time, disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth whenever you're not using them, and make judicious use of aeroplane mode to try and get as much battery life as possible. Delve into the Battery menu in Settings to see the apps that are using up all your battery juice, and enable Nougat's battery saver feature, which should give you a few more minutes before your handset dies. Tap the menu button (three vertical dots) then choose Battery optimization to see if any apps have opted out of the battery saver mode without your knowledge. Tap the three dots again then select Reset app preferences to see if this fixes the issue. Spotty Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections Image: Screenshot Various issues have been reported across web forums, so it's tough to know exactly what the issue might be out of the gates. First start with the basics. If you can, establish that the problem really does lie with your newly upgraded Nougat device by testing other phones or tablets with the Wi-Fi or the Bluetooth that's causing you problems. If those devices struggle as well then there's something wrong with your network or Bluetooth connection rather than Android Nougat. Next, try turning your device on and off, or temporarily disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (going into aeroplane mode for a few minutes is the quickest way to do this). In some cases telling Android to forget and then reconnect to a Wi-Fi network or a Bluetooth device can do the trick. You can do this by tapping on the entry in question in either the Wi-Fi or the Bluetooth menu in Settings. Image: Screenshot Wiping the system cache partition, where your phone's temporary data is stored, has been suggested as a solution in some cases (it won't delete any of your personal data). With your phone off, press and hold the volume down button, then press and hold the power button to turn the device on in recovery mode. When you see the Start message, press the volume down button twice to highlight recovery mode, then press the power button to select it. When you see the android and the red exclamation mark, hold down the power button and tap the volume up button. You'll get another menu. Press the volume down button to highlight the wipe cache partition option, and the power button to select it, and you're all done. Unstable or crashing apps Image: Screenshot The quickest fix for an app that's playing up after you've installed Android 7.0 Nougat is just to uninstall and reinstall it. You can also use the app's entry in the Apps menu in Settings to clear the app's temporary data cache and stored settings. Both processes should give the app a clean slate to work with, and if it's still causing issues, then you might want to get in touch with the developer, or at least check out the app's official support pages (usually linked to from its Google Play Store listing). Image: Screenshot If it's the OS as a whole you're having issues with, and it doesn't seem related to any app in particular, then you can either sit tight and wait for a fix to come through an official update, do a factory reset through the Backup & reset menu in Settings, or install a fresh factory image from the ones supplied by Google. If you've got a Nexus 5X and are experiencing random reboots after upgrading to Nougat, we've got some bad news: it looks like you're one of a small number of people affected by a hardware issue and Google advises looking into warranty and repair options from the place where you bought the phone. It seems some people have found a fix by reflashing Android 7.0 Nougat, though. Other Nougat problems Image: Gizmodo Those are the three big issues we've come across in our travels around the web, but there are likely to be all kinds of other little issues popping up, as is often the case when a new version of Android rolls out. The simplest and most obvious fix is to keep checking for updates, not just for Android itself but for all the apps you have installed. Any official bugs that have been identified are going to get squashed in this way. Some detective work on the web can help as well: be as specific as possible in your web searches (phone make, model, exact bug and so on) to try and find other people stuck with the same annoyance as you are. If you can't find any existing reports, try registering the bug yourself through the appropriate channels. For Nexus and Pixel devices, this post has some comprehensive advice about getting Android 7.0 Nougat running smoothly again. Good luck out there. Comments M.W. Guest Dec 8, 2016, 11:03am I seem to have fixed my battery drain issues by letting it drop to 0% and dying. Seems like the update lost battery calibration. Letting it die lets it recalibrate and this worked for me. Back to lasting art least a full day with need heavy use. Reply 0 trishool @trishool Feb 6, 2017, 6:23am Thanks I'll try that today. Reply 0 Skurfer @skurfer Feb 6, 2017, 12:02pm Yep I was seemingly able to recalibrate it that way as well. The trick for me was I let it run down until the phone turned itself off, then didn't plug it in and just turned it back on. When it booted back up it had 15% still left and I kept using it until it turned off again. I turned it on again and it still had 5% left and it lasted a few more minutes of me using it until it turned off and wouldn't turn back on anymore. I put it on the charger and let it charge up to full. Have been getting a fair bit more battery usage out of it since then.

Emily Fortuna / Twitter Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement Business is anything but usual for some of America's largest companies, as they question — or blatantly decry — President Trump's immigration ban. Google, Amazon, Starbucks, and Facebook are just a few of the big names to have stepped forward and denounce Trump's executive order, which restricts the entry of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and indefinitely bans Syrian refugees altogether. In the latest scuffle, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday his company was considering taking legal action to have Trump's executive order reversed, noting that hundreds of Apple staff had been affected by the travel ban. "More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds," Cook told the WSJ. "That's what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that." The following Fortune 500 companies have either publicly challenged or expressed concern over the order: Amazon Apple Citigroup Expedia Facebook Ford Goldman Sachs Alphabet Intel JPMorgan Chase MasterCard Microsoft Netflix Nike Procter & Gamble Salesforce Twitter, Square, Airbnb, Github, Etsy, Lyft, Uber, Tesla, and TripAdvisor have also protested the ban, as have pharmaceutical companies sych as Allergan and Perlara. Actions Speak Louder Than Words With so many firms lending their voice to the cause, it must be asked: Is each company genuinely invested in seeing the ban dissolved because of their values — or are some brands just riding the wave of a big marketing moment? The answer is multi-faceted: On one hand, any U.S. company speaking out against the president is taking a risk; on the other hand, it comes down to what actions these brands take beyond their statements. "A lot of people do approve the ban, so these companies are taking a risk just by taking a stance against it," said Margaret Wolfson, founder and creative director at River + Wolf. "But there seem to be three levels involved: The first is in making a statement that brands you as a compassionate believer in American values; the second is in employers looking out for their employees so they feel protected, and the third level — the hardest of all because of the logistics it entails — is going beyond the verbal to the visceral and investing time, energy, and money." Google, Starbucks, Lyft, and Airbnb, are among those companies putting their money where their values are, so to speak. Related: Silicon Valley Has Visceral Reaction to Trump's Ban "We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the United States," a Google spokesperson told NBC News. "We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere." To make its views not only known, but felt, Google created a $4 million crisis fund for those affected by the ban, pledging $2 million that can be matched by up to $2 million from employees to fund organizations such as the ACLU and the International Rescue Committee. Starbucks announced it was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks operates. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment, instead referring to chairman and CEO Howard Schultz's public letter to Starbucks partners. Lyft has pledged to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment beyond co-founder and CEO Logan Green's three tweets and Lyft's ACLU blog post. Soon after the ban was issued, Airbnb announced that it would provide free temporary housing to refugees and others impacted by the ban. "This initiative is a part of Airbnb's longstanding commitment to addressing the needs of refugees," said an Airbnb spokesperson, citing the company's past pledge to match up to $1 million donations to UNHCR. Also to be noted is Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos' assertion that Amazon is prepared to support a lawsuit against Trump and his administration over the order, while Twitter's Jack Dorsey released a short film about Syrian refugee and entrepreneur Yassin Tehrou. Thinking on a Global Level Companies campaigning against the ban may not only be looking to protect American values, but their global relationships as well. "A lot of organizations that have and will come out against [Trump's ban] are global firms that need support in other parts of the world," said Ronald Hill, a professor of marketing and business law at Villanova School of Business. "I wouldn't be surprised if global firms coming out against it do business in areas such as Western Europe that have high Muslim populations. You have to think from a global and not just a local perspective." Hill anticipates that more businesses will be chiming in against the ban, particularly those that have a history of prioritizing corporate social responsibility — despite the backlash they may receive. "Some fashion companies came out in support of people with AIDS relatively early on when there was still backlash against that," said Hill. "This is a continuation of that corporate social responsibility, but it's a new, unexplored avenue." How the Work Pays Off While companies embark upon this new avenue, organizations such as the ACLU are prospering more than ever. "Historically, the ACLU doesn't get much support from companies. We're often viewed as a thorn in the government's side because we challenge them on issues," Mark Wier, chief development officer at the ACLU, told NBC News. "But we are seeing some companies create formalized gifts, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses have offered to share proceeds of sales." From last Friday, when Trump issued the immigration ban, to the following Monday, Wier says that the ACLU raised a record $35 million. Related: Celebs and VIPs Donate to ACLU to Fight Trump "We've never seen that kind of outpouring so quickly," said Wier, adding that the ACLU will use the funding to hire over 100 employees including litigators, advocates, and communications specialists. "We need to power up the grid up we've already established with more force," said Wier. "Since the ACLU was able to get a stay on that executive order in federal district court, people are really seeing that it is possible to do something — and to actually win."

It's the largest such move on the scene for a few years now and with an ambitions $3 billion valuation, all eyes are naturally on the company behind the Snapchat phenomenon. IPO documents are traditionally meant for prospective investors and reading them, for most of us ordinary folks is typically likened to methodically going through a dictionary, or rather, something with more numbers, like a phonebook. However, Snap's one does offer some interesting insights on the company and its yellow ghost mascot and chart-topping chat app. Annotated diagrams Since, most prospective investors don't necessarily spend their days sending self-destructing snaps to their work associates, Snap Inc. did understandably decide to throw in a general description of the service, along with detailed interface diagrams. If you ever felt a need for a Snapchat user manual, this is probably as close as it will ever get. Snapchat diagrams Snapchat diagrams $2 billion Google deal If you ever wondered what kind of computational infrastructure powers Snapchat and what allowed it to withstand a whopping 48% year over year growth, the answer is now clear - Google. The web titan is, among many other things, a player in the cloud services market. However, it is far from a leader, with stiff competition from Microsoft and especially Amazon. Snap Inc., however, is one of Google's earliest and biggest cloud service clients. The new service contract spans over the next five years and is a big deal for Google's cloud division. Under it, Snap is required to spend at least $400 million a year on Google's services. But, with that kind of long-term commitment, there are some perks to be gained as well, like discounted pricing and the possibility to delay payments the first four years. However, no other figures besides the $2 billion have been quoted. There is also another aspect of this partnership that Snap pointed out to its future investors. To quite the document itself: Any disruption of or interference with our use of the Google Cloud operation would negatively affect our operations and seriously harm our business iOS first Speaking of dependencies and "favorite teams", the IPO filing does also mention that the iOS release of the Snapchat app is definitely "prioritized" over its Android sibling. This would explain a lot of the criticism from various users of Google's mobile OS. Still, it is also quite justifiable, since Snap claims a larger chunk of its users do come from the iOS crowd. This is yet another company relation cited as a possible pitfall. If we are unable to improve operability of our products on smartphones with Android operating systems, and those smartphones become more popular and fewer people use smartphones with iOS operating systems, our business could be seriously harmed. Admittedly, this is a rather far-fetched Apple doomsday scenario, which currently seems highly unlikely. Still, investors need to be warned. Wider availability of Spectacles Finishing off on a more positive note, Spectacles - Snapchat's quirky camera accessory sunglasses, will likely see a wider release in the future. The novelty item currently has somewhat of a collectible status, since it was only sold through a single store and a pop-up vending machine when first launched. In the IPO filing, Snap does mention its plans to "significantly broaden the distribution of Spectacles". Sadly, no extra detail is available on this point either.

If your friends are using Snapchat actively to send snaps and stories, then you are probably missing out on the fun. But if they are not using Snapchat, then you are fine (ignorance is bliss ;P)!

Android and iOS both have smart photo services built in nowadays, but what happens when you want to jump from one to the other? Here's what you need to know. In this guide we'll be tackling the challenge of moving your whole photo library from one service to the other: this is a full traded-in-my-iPhone-for-a-Pixel scenario, a clean break where you're switching from Apple Photos to Google Photos or back the other way. Image: Google For a lot of people it might be better to have a foot in both camps, at least for some photos or for some of the time, but for simplicity's sake we won't go into every possible scenario here. You can in fact use these services alongside each other pretty easily, but in this case we'll tackle going from one to the other wholesale. It's also worth noting these are not exactly directly comparable services, with Apple's photo offerings very much baked into its hardware and software, and Google Photos very much web-first and operating independently of your computers, phones and tablets. Switching from Apple Photos to Google Photos Before you jump to Google Photos you need to decide if you want to store your photos (and videos) at their original resolution or whether you're happy to put up with some resizing — images are stored at a maximum of 16 megapixels and videos are stored at a maximum of 1080p HD. If you choose the second option, you can store as much as you want, for free. If you want to keep everything as it is, you need to think about paying for Google Drive storage, as you only get 15GB for free. Prices start at 100GB for $US1.99 ($3) a month. Once you've decided, you need to work out where your photos are, and given the different apps on macOS and iOS, and the recent upgrades to both, you could be forgiven for not being too sure. Thankfully, Google Photos isn't too fussed. Download the Google Photos desktop client for macOS and mobile app for iOS and both will get to work picking up all the pictures from your computers and iDevices. The desktop app asks which photo libraries you want to back up when you start it, and the iOS app simply backs up everything it can find. The only images and videos that might get missed are those you've uploaded to iCloud and deleted from your devices, if you're using iCloud. To get these files back on macOS, launch Photos, then open the Photos menu, choose Preferences, switch to iCloud and make sure Download Originals to Mac is selected. On iOS, if you have the space, open Settings then tap iCloud, Photos and Download and Keep Originals. If for whatever reason you can't get your iCloud photos back to a Mac or iOS device, the export options from iCloud on the web are a little less than stellar. Pictures can be downloaded individually easily enough, but for bulk downloads you have to use the Shift or Cmd keys to select multiple items at once, then click the download icon. Once saved somewhere, they can be uploaded to Google Photos using a desktop client or just your web browser. Switching from Google Photos to Apple Photos As we've said, Google Photos lives on the web, but getting all your pictures and videos back down again isn't too difficult — though it might take some time if you've got a massive photo library and a sluggish internet connection. With Apple Photos, you don't have to store your pictures in the cloud, but if you do then you'll probably need to pay for extra storage. The Google Photos desktop client for macOS doesn't have two-way sync, but the one for Google Drive does. First, go to Google Drive on the web, open the Settings page (via the cog icon) and tick the box marked Automatically put your Google Photos into a folder in My Drive under the General tab. That doesn't change anything about what's stored in Google Photos, it just makes everything visible in Google Drive. Then, download and install the macOS client for Google Drive, and make sure the Google Photos folder is selected in the list of folders to sync, which will be displayed during the setup process. Hey presto, all your photos and videos are pulled down from the cloud. In the Photos app on your Mac, pick File then Import to load in the newly downloaded content. It's only if you don't have a Mac computer to hand that difficulties arise — if you're using Apple's photo services solely on iPhones, iPads, and the web, maybe. If you have a Windows machine to hand, you can use the same trick as above to get the images and videos downloaded. Then, instead of running the Photos app on macOS, use iTunes and your iDevice, or just iCloud on the web, to get everything up to the iCloud Photo Library. Alternatively you can use the Google Takeout service to download all of your pictures and video from Google Photos if you don't want to go down the Google Drive syncing route. All of your stuff gets served up as a compressed folder which you can then extract and move to Apple's apps on the desktop, on mobile and in the cloud. A computer of some kind really is essential though as a stopgap between Google Photos and Apple's Photos apps, even if you're planning to use nothing but an iPhone and iCloud Photo Library for the rest of your life. In other words you can't go straight from cloud service to cloud service. Without investing too much time and effort you should be up and running on your new photo management system and ready to take and store pictures again — at least until you decide to switch to something new.

Interestingly, it also filed complaints directly with link shortening services such as Adf.ly, which are used by pirates to generate revenue. One such uploader informs TF that his account has now been terminated. According to copyright holders, online piracy is fueled by people’s desire to make money. The statement carries some truth but has traditionally applied to a relatively small number of people at the top of the food chain. The advent of file-hosting platforms, however, has enabled the smaller guy to turn a small profit. While many ‘cyberlockers’ pay out a commission to uploaders when a file is downloaded every 1000 times, there are some other ways to make a bit of cash too. At their core, link shortening services such as Google’s goo.gl convert unmanageably long URLs into compact ones for easy sharing. They also offer analytics so people can understand who is clicking on their content. However, there are also other services that pay out a small commission for each click. As a result, they have become popular with anyone looking to monetize all kinds of content, including pirates hoping to make a few extra bucks. One such pirate contacted TF this week following the leaking of Resident Evil 7 online. With its Denuvo protection neutralized, owner Capcom reverted to sending DMCA notices, including to Google which was asked to remove well over 1,700 URLs from its search results. Those notices contained requests to remove “link shortener” URLs – such as those provided by Adf.ly, Shorte.st, and Linkbucks.com – all of which pay commission to users when others click their links. However, in addition to taking down Resident Evil 7 links from Google search, file-hosting and torrent sites, it appears that Capcom also sent complaints directly to Adf.ly. Of course, that meant the referrer links died, which in turn killed the revenue stream. While there’s no doubt that Adf.ly links are widely used by pirates, the company informs TorrentFreak that it has a strict repeat infringer policy in place. “We operate a 3 strike repeat offender policy. If the Company has received three valid DMCA notices, the Company will notify [the] user they have 72 hours to issue any Counter-Notices or their account will be suspended,” the policy reads. That not only cost our source his links, but also his account and all of the commission money held in it. “Upon suspension, no funds will be paid to the account owner and no links will be accessible belonging to the user’s account,” Adf.ly confirmed. But perhaps of most interest is the effect this type of action has on uploader morale. If those who post Adf.ly and similar commission-based links to infringing content keep losing their accounts, ALL of the links in their account become useless for generating revenue, even if just one copyright holder such as Capcom continually files complaints. There are also knock-on effects if content uploaders want to recover their position, our tipster notes. “[This could] possibly screw [shortener] pirates for good since all these links are hardcoded into blog posts and not dynamically generated. Meaning once you get banned you have to manually ‘fix’ each and every link on all the previous uploads,” he explains. “Capcom is very aggressive. If you reupload the thing they report it again after a few days. I got banned from Adfly thanks to Capcom. Adfly has a 3 strikes (in a 6 month period) policy. For me it worked, I stopped uploading Capcom games altogether.” TF asked how easy it is to open another account with Adf.ly, in order to wipe the slate clean and start again. Apparently, it’s not straightforward since the company uses a number of techniques to spot those signing back up. For example, according to our experience when simply accessing their site, Adf.ly blocks some popular VPN ranges. However, since the company keeps all of the money in closed accounts, other options are preferred. “Adfly keeps all the money. No questions asked. You lose all rights immediately,” our source explains. “People usually give up and move to the next link shortener.” And so, the cycle continues.

Home World news Google, unlike Microsoft, must turn over foreign emails: US judge Google, unlike Microsoft, must turn over foreign emails: US judge A US judge has ordered Google to comply with search warrants seeking customer emails stored outside the the country. By: Reuters | Washington | Updated: February 5, 2017 4:08 AM A security guard keeps watch as he walks past a logo of Google in Shanghai. (Reuters) A US judge has ordered Google to comply with search warrants seeking customer emails stored outside the United States, diverging from a federal appeals court that reached the opposite conclusion in a similar case involving Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). US Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. The judge said this was because there was “no meaningful interference” with the account holder’s “possessory interest” in the data sought. “Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,” Rueter wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), said in a statement on Saturday: “The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants.” The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that US investigators sought in a narcotics case. That decision last July 14 was welcomed by dozens of technology and media companies, privacy advocates, and both the American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On January 24, the same appeals court voted not to revisit the decision. The four dissenting judges called on the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns. Both cases involved warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law that many technology companies and privacy advocates consider outdated.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Google-Google+ Just the other day, we told you that Google had spent some serious cash in order to run at least one ad during tomorrow's Super Bowl 51. While we figured that the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL would be starring in the commercial, it turns out that the Google Home will be the subject matter of at least one spot. The problem is, the ad is the exact same video clip that Google posted on YouTube back in October. That means the ad will not mention the new Netflix integration that allows users to select a movie or television show to stream over a Chromecast device. It seems a bit odd to spend $5 million for a 30-second ad that is four months old. And Google is mired in a battle with Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's upcoming Cortana powered virtual assistant, and others. Google needs to show everything that Google Home can do in order to compete with Amazon, which has a head start over its rival. Google Home, by the way, uses Google Assistant which allows it to be more conversational than Google Now. There is nothing wrong with the ad per se. After all, it shows consumers exactly what Google Home is, how it works, and why they would want one in their home. And with the large number of people watching the game, we're sure that Google will sell a number of units next week. For those of you who have not seen the clip on YouTube, you can check it out by tapping on the video at the top of this story. source: Google via AndroidAuthority Android 7.0 starts rolling out to the unlocked Moto Z 04 Feb Prev news FCC listing reveals Huawei could bring an entry-level smartphone to the 04 Feb Next news Close newer posts "Expert" HTC 10 owners in Europe can now flash Android 7.0 on their phone 04 Feb Jawbone to quit making consumer wearables, focus on clinical products and 04 Feb Android Wear 2.0 and LG's new watches could be unveiled a day earlier on 04 Feb FCC listing reveals Huawei could bring an entry-level smartphone to the 04 Feb Now reading: Check out the Super Bowl 51 ad starring Google Home; it's Deja Vu Check out the Super Bowl 51 ad starring Google Home; it's Deja Vu 04 Feb Android 7.0 starts rolling out to the unlocked Moto Z 04 Feb Mystery LG ‘L63BL’ smartphone stops by the FCC, likely headed to US budget 04 Feb Newest Xperia X Concept update adds Ambient mode, features multiple fixes 04 Feb PSA: the YouTube app lets you double-tap to rewind or fast forward videos 04 Feb Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 render and latest rumored specs appear 04 Feb older posts Featured stories   The LG G6 wil use the Snapdragon 821 for a great reason   iPhone 8 might get an iris scanner   Bad news: 10% worse battery life on S7 and S7 Edge after Nougat update   Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) is a battery beast   Ming-Chi Kuo: iPhone 8 wireless charging a sure thing   Apple iPhone vs Samsung Galaxy: a history of the biggest smart phone rivalry 1 Comments Follow Following Options Close Always view all comments Show comments: default hide low rated show moderated comments Display mode: Threaded Chronological Newest first Save posted on 05 Feb 2017, 20:10 1 Reply 1. joey_sfb (Posts: 6218; Member since: 29 Mar 2012) I think Google is happy with the Pixel Sales, Google Home not so much!

This was confirmed in a blog post from the latter company’s co-founder and chief executive, who believes the acquisition will help Planet achieve its “most impactful year” ever. On Friday, Planet Labs CEO Will Marshall announced on the company’s official website that it has struck up a deal with Google parent company, Alphabet, to acquire its Terra Bella business, which most importantly includes seven high-resolution SkySat satellites. Once the sale is closed, Google will purchase Planet’s earth-imaging data over several years. #Google sells off Terra Bella satellite unit to Planet Labs https://t.co/bd8nS0GzL2 pic.twitter.com/AW3WAyoKVq — AppleInsider (@appleinsider) February 3, 2017 The constellation of high-res satellites appears to be, and is a big score for Planet. According to TechCrunch, there’s also the fact that Google’s satellites stand out for the clear and crisp image quality they provide to Google Earth and Google Maps users, thanks to their use of “sub-meter” technology. But Marshall stressed that the SkySat acquisition is more “complementary” than anything else. “We’ve long admired what the team at Terra Bella has achieved and we think the SkySat constellation of seven high resolution satellites is highly complementary to Planet’s existing medium resolution 60-satellite fleet. The former enable regular, rapidly updated snapshots of select areas of the globe at sub-meter resolution; the latter regular, global coverage at 3-5 meter resolution.” The deal also means some organizational changes for both companies, Marshall added. An unspecified number of employees from Terra Bella will continue their work at Planet, as the satellite imaging arm blends in with its new parent. As quoted on Marshall’s blog post, Google vice president of Product and Engineering Jen Fitzpatrick said that Planet Labs is a “natural” choice for Terra Bella’s new home. “Terra Bella has accomplished a lot in the past two years—including the design and launch of five more satellites. We’re excited to see what’s ahead for Terra Bella, and look forward to being a long-term customer.” Separate from its acquisition of Terra Bella, Planet has been making some ambitious plans as of late. On Friday, the company also announced that it hopes to launch about 88 cubists, or smaller satellites, marking the largest onetime satellite launch in history. This event is scheduled to take place on February 14. The Potential Impact of @terra_bella & @planetlabs https://t.co/nxOJYPRdL6 @LauraICP @ICPJim @ICPPat @AndrewICP pic.twitter.com/wUkMvLUfJ3 — Melissa Molseed ???? (@MelisICP) January 26, 2017 Although it appears as if both sides are publicly looking forward to the deal, Terra Bella’s sale also continues Alphabet’s streamlining of its broader business, as it goes with a leaner and meaner approach that focuses on specific arms and does away with those that are less essential to the core. Specifically, Alphabet has singled out its robotics, self-driving car, and drone arms, to name a few, as being of lesser importance. To this end, the company placed the Boston Dynamics robotics division on sale in May 2016, and shut down its solar-powered drone project in January in order to devote more attention and resources to other initiatives. All in all, The Verge described this approach, as led by Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat, as one that is “more strict and cost-conscious.” But it has also resulted in some “tension” within the company, as well as the departure of several movers and shakers within the Alphabet fold, including self-driving car guru Chris Urmson, Nest CEO Tony Fadell, and Access (a.k.a. Google Fiber) head Craig Barratt, who all left Alphabet within the last year. Neither Alphabet nor Planet Labs disclosed any information on the financial terms of the Terra Bella purchase, though TechCrunch‘s report also offered some insight into how much Planet may have ended up paying. According to the publication, rumored buyer Climate Corporation had offered a price of $300 million before getting outbid by Planet.

 Analyst: Snap's 'core health is very poor' but there is a silver lining Julie Bort Feb. 3, 2017, 5:30 PM 5,836 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mike Nudelman/Business Insider Financial analysts have now had a bit of time to pore over Snap's finances and issue their opinions, since it released its IPO prospectus on Thursday. One such analyst is James Gellert, CEO of Rapid Ratings. His mission is a little different to the average analyst. Instead of Wall Street's usual buy/sell/hold-the-stock view, Gellert rates over 60,000 public and private companies to see how likely they are to default on their financial commitments, possibly even to the point of bankruptcy. Overall, Snap isn't at high risk to default. But it's not at low risk either, Gellert finds. It rated a 47-100, meaning a medium risk. The problem? Its "core health is very poor," Gellert writes in his report on the company. Snap "demonstrates weakness in earnings performance, operating profitability, net profitability and capital structure efficiency relative to the global industry set," he writes, based on analyzing Snap's finances over the last 12 months. Too much Google? In particular, Gellert says Snap's capex efficiency is in the lowest 15-th percentile compared to other companies globally. Tech Insider/Flickr/Horia Varlan That is, perhaps, to be expected. Snap is a young company growing quickly and is dependent on third-party data centers (aka cloud computing) to run its company. Last month, Snap signed a five-year, $2 billion with Google to provide cloud services that guarantees Google a payment of $400 million a year. Snap's entire revenue for 2016 was just over $404 million. Snap has always used Google's cloud and has been touted as one of the Google cloud's biggest success stories. In fact, Alphabet's venture capital arm, CapitalG, is even one of Snap's investors. However, Snap may not be so dependent on Google forever. In the fall, months before it signed this five-year deal, the company famously hired an expert in building data centers away from Amazon Web Services to lead its engineering team. Plus, it indicated in its SEC documents that it "may invest in building our own infrastructure" and that it is also "currently negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations." The company offers no real hints about who that provider might be. However, it does say that it worked with Oracle Data Cloud to study how ads that run on its apps drive in-store sales of consumer goods. It would be a huge coupe for Oracle to snare some or all of Snap away from Google. Like Twitter, except different Gellert tells us that there are eerily similarities between Snap and Twitter. Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey Larry French/Getty Images "Twitter showed a showed a similar Financial Health profile back in 2013 at the time of its IPO, but that’s not to say that Snap is in for the same kind of trouble,"he says.  "Snap has the unique opportunity to learn from Twitter’s giant missteps, and if it’s going to have success, it needs to capitalize," he says. Plus, there's no reason to believe Snap will experience Twitter's same problems. "The revolving door of management and lack of coherent product direction at Twitter killed confidence. Their part-time CEO plan is a bizarre and controversial decision. Snap needs to convey direction, a path to profitability, and grow a team that has confidence and stays with the company to then deliver results," he says. Then again, Snap has its own hurdle to overcome: it's culture of secrecy. "As a company that historically hasn’t conveyed much direction and taken pride in its secrecy, even internally, this is a new world. The public eye is sure to bring many challenges for Snap’s management team considering the public equity markets don’t like opacity,” Gellert says.

The Nexus 5X was one of two of Google's last Nexus phones. Image: lili sams/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-02-04 20:55:55 UTC In one fell swoop last October, Google launched its new Pixel phones and killed off its beloved Nexus devices.  If you own a Nexus and still feel betrayed, there might be some good news on the horizon. 9to5Google's Stephen Hall says he was recently told Google might bring the Pixel's Assistant to the Nexus 5X and 6P in a future update. Was recently told that Assistant is finally coming to Nexus 5X/6P soon with next “major” update. — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) February 2, 2017 It wouldn't be the first Pixel feature to find its way to the Nexus. Google recently brought the Pixels' "fingerprint swipe" gesture, which lets you swipe up and down on a fingerprint sensor to scroll through notifications to the Nexus 5X, due to popular demand. If Hall's source is right, Google porting the Assistant to the Nexus 5X and 6P would be a dramatic shift in strategy for the company. When the Pixels were announced, Google said the Assistant would be exclusive to its new phones and Google Home. The Assistant, Google said, would be one of the the key differentiators and major selling points of the Pixel and Pixel XL. Google porting the Assistant to the Nexus 5X and 6P would be dramatic shift in strategy. But as I noted in my Pixel review, while the Assistant is good (especially at understanding context), limiting it to just Google hardware hurts more than it helps since it'll only be used by the smaller subset of Android users who can afford to pay big bucks for a premium device.  The rest of Android's users — the midrange and even upper-budget tier — are left completely out of the loop.  Putting the Assistant on more devices (even if they're old ones) would greatly expand its user base and machine-learning capabilities. I'd even argue it's the "Google way" of doing things. Google's Nexus phones might not be the only devices that will get the Assistant. Android TV's getting it via the Nexus Player. Leaks suggest the Assistant will also make its way to the company's two flagship Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches, which could be announced on Feb. 9. The same goes for LG's upcoming flagship G6 phone.

Search Reviews iPhone Android How To Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] How to Add Always On Display to Any Android Cory Gunther04/21/2016 This guide will explain how Android smartphone owners can get the same “Always-On Display” feature found on the popular Galaxy S7 or LG G5 for almost any new device. It originally debuted back on the Moto X, and is now a key feature on many flagship smartphones released in 2016. Advertisement Motorola and Google both offer always-on display for their phones, like Ambient Display, but they aren’t on 24/7 displaying information for readers. That is something that until now, was only available for Galaxy S7, S7 Edge or LG G5 owners. However, a simple app on the Google Play Store delivers this for anyone and everyone. Read: How to Enable LG G5 Always On Display Those with an old LG G4, Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, or any newer Android phone for that matter are probably wondering if their phones will get this. Samsung could add it to the Galaxy S6 or Note 5, but it didn’t come with the Android 6.0 Marshmallow update release. As a result, we’ve found a quick way for most new phones to have it as well. Read on for more details. Typically most smartphone users turn on their screen over 140 times a day, according to research. That’s a lot, which can often drain battery life very quick. As a result Samsung, LG and Motorola have added a new feature to their devices. If you want it on your device, we’ll show owners how. Advertisement Unlike Motorola or Google, Samsung and LG have a small area of the screen turned on 24/7 with helpful information. Like the time, date, battery levels and incoming notifications. It’s called an Always-On Display, and Samsung even allows a small level of customization. This makes it so owners can glance at the screen and get helpful information without turning it on, saving battery life. Being able to quickly check the time, see that there is an unread message, or easily check the date on the fly. Always-On Display is a great feature that many love. At first I disabled it on the Galaxy S7 Edge, but have come to love it. Get Always-On Display for Any Android So how can you add the neat Always On Display features from the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 to your older Galaxy S6, Note 5, LG G4 and more? Easy. With a well-designed and highly customizable app on the Google Play Store called Glance Plus. Originally this app was designed to bring a Windows Phone feature to Android, but has since been updated with more options, more features, and different looks that simulate the popular new LG G5 and Galaxy S7. It works the same way, by turning a small area of the screen on. Either for a short period, or 24/7. What’s even better, is the developer promises the app only drains roughly 1% of battery life an hour, or 8% during an entire work day. The same claim as LG for its new G5 smartphone. As long as you have an Android smartphone (or tablet) with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean or newer, as well as a proximity sensor which almost every Android phone has, this app will work for you. Here are the instructions. Advertisement Download Glance Plus from the Google Play Store Open the App and Turn the feature on Customize all the options, controls, brightness and more Turn off screen and wait for the Always-On Display The proximity sensor on users phones notices when it is removed from a pocket, and the always-on display turns on. Owners can also wave their hand over the device while it’s sitting on a table, for the same effect using the sensor. Shown above are three of the many different options available. Glance Plus has background images and clock styles to match the LG G5, always-on display calendars that are similar to the Galaxy S7, and tons of customization. From clock styles, font color, brightness, notifications which can be shown on the screen while it’s turned off, weather information and more. It’s like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 on steroids, with a lot more options and customization. It’s also worth noting that owners may want to go in and adjust a lot of settings. Enable notifications, set a night mode where the screen won’t turn on at night, turn up (or down) the always-on display brightness levels, and other things. Overall Glance Plus seems like a great alternative to the Always-On Display feature found on other devices. It’s more customizable and capable than the Galaxy S7, matches battery drain of the LG G5, and has tons to offer potential users. Try it today for free, or get an even better paid version for $5 with in-app purchases. Enjoy.

Google and LG’s announcement of the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style is now expected to happen on February 8. The watches were reportedly set to debut on February 9, but according to Evan Blass, Google and LG have decided to move the announcement up by one day. An official launch of Android Wear 2.0 is also expected on February 8. The LG Watch Sport is rumored to be the higher-end of these two new watches, packing features like a 1.38-inch 480x480 display, 768MB, RAM, NFC, GPS, 4G LTE, and IP68 water and dust resistance. Meanwhile, the LG Watch Style will reportedly have a smaller 1.2-inch 360x360 screen with 512MB of RAM and an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. The watches seem to be the result of a Nexus-like collaboration between Google and LG. Rumors have suggested that their pricing will start at $349 for the LG Watch Sport and $249 for the LG Watch Style.

On Friday, US Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter ruled in Philadelphia that transferring emails from a foreign server so the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can read them as a part of a domestic fraud probe is legally sound. Read more Telegram launches anonymous blogging tool ‘Telegraph’ He noted that the emails, which are routinely stored overseas by Google, would only be read in the United States, causing "no meaningful interference." “Google regularly transfers user data from one data center to another without the customer's knowledge,” said Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter, as quoted in The Register. “Such transfers do not interfere with the customer’s access or possessory interest in the user data. Even if the transfer interferes with the account owner's control over his information, this interference is de minimis [minimal] and temporary.” Judge Rueter’s decision comes seven months after the US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York found that Microsoft did not have to show foreign emails to American authorities unless investigators go through local privacy laws first, a verdict that was upheld on January 24. The decision was welcomed by privacy advocates, the American Civil Liberties Union and the US Chamber of Commerce. In both cases, authorities sought the emails under the Stored Communications Act from 1986, which addresses disclosure of electronic records held by third party internet providers. The ruling by Judge Rueter has been questioned by some legal experts. Read more Twitter reveals details of 2 FBI national security letters after gag order lifted “The court suggests that bringing a file back to the United States is not a seizure because Google moves data around all the time and ‘this interference is de minimis and temporary’,” Professor Orin Kerr wrote in the Washington Post. “I don't think that works. Google is a private company not regulated by the Fourth Amendment, so whether it moves around data is irrelevant. And I don't see what is 'de minimis and temporary' about the government ordering Google to make a copy of your email pursuant to a court order.” For its part, Google, which receives over 25,000 annual requests for user data from US authorities, plans to appeal the decision. "The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision,” the company said in its statement, as quoted by Reuters. Companies such as Google, Facebook and Yahoo have come under increased public pressure to do more to ensure their users’ privacy in recent years, particularly in the wake of revelations about mass surveillance by the NSA (National Security Agency) revealed during Barack Obama’s presidency.

Photo: Reuters ALSO READ Swiggy raises $15 million funding from Bessemer Matrimony.com IPO by next month Matrimony.com to go for IPO by November For a bigger share of the pie Quikr acquires Stayglad, its 8th buy in a year Snap’s initial public offering filing seemed to show a company with a basic math problem: the company’s cost of revenue for 2016 — the amount it had to spend just to keep the messaging service running — was $47 million higher than its $405 million in sales.   The high cost of revenue, which in Snap’s case consists mainly of payments to Alphabet’s Google for hosting the service, means that, on an annual basis, Snap lost money on every one of its 158 million users in 2016, even before accounting for salaries, office rents or anything else.   Snap revealed in its IPO prospectus, filed with securities regulators on Thursday, that it will pay Google at least $2 billion over the nextfive years.   But the cost side of the problem may not be as serious as it seems. The company’s hosting costs are broadly in line with other social media companies. Its cost of revenue per active daily user was 97 cents in the last quarter of 2016, not much higher than the 85 cents that Facebook paid for each of its 1.23 billion daily users in the final quarter of 2016.   Further, while Snap’s cost of revenue was higher than sales on a yearly basis in 2016, the company drastically tightened up hosting costs over the course of the year. While costs were nearly double revenues at the start of the year, by the fourth quarter, when Snap hit 158 million users, the company eked out a small gross margin.   Snap’s bigger math problem is how much revenue it generates per user. The $1.05 per user for the last quarter of 2016 was a massive increase from the 31 cents per user it drew in the same period in 2015. In its IPO filing, Snap said it hopes to increase its revenue per user by focusing on more lucrative advertising markets, like North America, where its revenue per user was $2.15 at the end of 2016, nearly double the global rate.   But even those higher rates for Snap pale in comparison to the $7.16 in revenue per user that Facebook brought in in the fourth quarter.   “Snap’s issue is not cost, but user growth and revenue per user,” said Ethan Kurzweil, a venture investor with Bessemer Venture Partners who backed start-ups such as Twitch and Periscope but has not backed Snap. “If they can get revenue per user into the kind of territory they think is possible, the cost of hosting will be a hit to gross margin but it’s not going to be an issue.”   Facebook provides the example. Even though its cost per user rose 7.4 per cent between the last quarter of 2016 versus a year earlier, its revenue per user grew at a much faster 27.5 per cent, a difference that helped drive its $10.2 billion in profits for the full year.   All of that does, however, mean that Snap has little leeway in delivering dramatic revenue growth in light of the high underlying cost of delivering all those pictures and videos.   The cost of revenue figure, noted analyst Brian Wieser at Pivotal Group, “was notable for what it indicates about the expense of running Snap.” Reuters Read More On Snap | Ipo | Google | Ethan Kurzweil | Bessemer Venture Partners | Facebook | International | Companies PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Cover from Natural Calamities.

Even though its cost per user rose 7.4 per cent between the last quarter of 2016 versus a year earlier, its revenue per user grew at a much faster 27.5 per cent, a difference that helped drive its $10.2 billion in profits for the full year.   All of that does, however, mean that Snap has little leeway in delivering dramatic revenue growth in light of the high underlying cost of delivering all those pictures and videos.   The cost of revenue figure, noted analyst Brian Wieser at Pivotal Group, “was notable for what it indicates about the expense of running Snap.” Reuters Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 MORE ON MARKETS: Quick Links Stock Market Live Portfolio Commodity Market Upcoming IPO Personal Finance Stock Market News Derivatives Mutual Funds Gold Price Sensex Browse STOCK Companies A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Browse Mutual Funds A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Index Stocks ACC Adani Ports Ambuja Cem.

These two have the greatest number of acquisitions in the space. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Feb 4, 2017 at 3:17PM Market-intelligence firm CB Insights has compiled a list of the major acquirers of private artificial-intelligence (AI) companies over the last five years. This list reveals well-known tech giants making large investments to increase their capabilities in AI. It also provides insight into the evolution of the technology, and its direct uses.   Google and Intel are in the race for artificial intelligence. Image source: Intel. Google's been on a buying spree Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is well known for its aspirations in artificial intelligence; it heads the list with 11 acquisitions. A number of these companies specialized in areas that led directly to recent improvements in the Google Assistant. They also tie to the launch of Google Home and its plans to take on Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa virtual assistant and the Echo smart-speaker home system. The acquisition of Emu provided an assistant that used voice commands to schedule appointments, set reminders, and make reservations. Api.ai added tools for building conversational bots, while Dark Blue Labs contributed natural-language improvements. Two companies helped personalize recommendations: Clever Sense learned about nearby coffee shops, restaurants and bars; Jetpac searched for visual cues in photos to improve recommendations. Timeful used priorities to add items to a calendar using smart scheduling. Three companies specialized in image recognition: DNNResearch focused on image search and facial recognition; Moodstocks technology improved image recognition for smartphones; Vision Factory worked to enhance accuracy and speed in object recognition. Each of the aforementioned technologies serves to improve specific functions in Google Home's ecosystem, and specifically within Assistant. This will compete directly in the virtual personal assistant market currently led by Amazon's Alexa. London-based DeepMind was one of the largest acquisitions, with a price tag estimated at $660 million. Google already boasted a significant investment in the area with its development of the Google Brain, a neural network developed in-house. Gains in AI research have been used to improve many areas of its current business. DeepMind is focused on improvements in general AI research, without any specific business objectives. That said, Google will use every opportunity to apply research gains to business uses.   Is Intel's acquisition of Nervana a threat to NVIDIA? Image source: Intel. Intel will take the fight to NVIDIA Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has made a number of acquisitions as well. Saffron specialized in cognitive computing, combining data analytics with deep learning; this relates directly to Intel's efforts in the same area. Indisys provided natural-language recognition, gesture recognition, and virtual-assistant technologies, but also created user interfaces for unmanned drones. Itseez focused on software for the Internet of Things (IoT), cameras, drones, and autonomous driving. Movidius brought computer-vision hardware for drones and cameras; it also provided system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for accelerating computer vision, as well as deep-learning capability. These companies integrate directly into Intel's RealSense brand for drones and virtual reality, and bolster its IoT business. The most significant of Intel's acquisitions, however, may be that of deep-learning start-up Nervana Systems. With a reported price of $408 million, this company is attempting to reduce machine learning to the size of a computer chip. Intel competitor NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has seen its stock price triple in 2016, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) become the chip of choice for companies training AI systems. If Intel can succeed at reducing machine learning to a level that could reside on a processor, that would be a significant boost to its business and a potentially troubling development for NVIDIA. As the battle for AI supremacy continues, we will likely see more consolidation in the industry, as tech giants try to gain an edge in this nascent technology. Success in the field will likely depend on successful integration of these acquisitions into existing business lines. Alphabet and Intel are on the right track.

Google Has to Hand Over Emails Stored on Foreign Data Centers, Unlike Microsoft GO The judge is trying to overturn the Microsoft ruling Feb 4, 2017 20:13 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Google now has to comply with search warrants targeting customer emails stored outside the United States, following a new order issued by a US judge. A previous federal court reached the complete opposite conclusion in a similar case involving Microsoft. The differences between the orders these two companies have to comply with is massive and opens up a lot of questions regarding people’s privacy. According to the new ruling, transferring emails from a server located in a different country than the United States in order for FBI agents to review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe does not qualify as seizure. “When Google produces the electronic data in accordance with the search warrants and the Government views it, the actual invasion of the account holder’s privacy - the searches - will occur in the United States. Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,” wrote Judge Thomas Rueter. Google is already planning to appeal the decision, especially since there is a precedent that stated the opposite. “We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants,” Google vows. According to court papers filed by Google, the company said it sometimes breaks up emails into pieces in order to improve network performance. Therefore, the company itself is not always in the know about where particular emails might be stored. Google has been complying with warrants as long as the data was stored on US data centers. Nine of its data centers are in the United States, while another six are located abroad - Taiwan, Singapore, Ireland, Netherlands, Finland, and Belgium. The precedent Back in July, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York concluded that Microsoft could not be forced to turn over mails to the authorities since they were stored on a Dublin server. It was decided a couple of weeks ago that the decision would not be revisited. The judges who ordered Google to serve the requested data regardless of the server it was stored on called on to the Supreme Court of the Congress to reverse the previous decision because it hurt law enforcement and raised concerns regarding national security. #Google#Microsoft#privacy#data center subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Alphabet Sells Satellite Imagery Moonshot Terra Bella KickassTorrents Trial Kicks Off in US Court Snapchat Thinks Using Google's Cloud Is Risky, Signs 5-Year $2B Deal Anyway Google Chrome for iOS Is Now Open Source Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One    Google will fight the new ruling Related Apps ProgDVB Professional: Watch TV channels from around the world, listen to radio station from the comfort of your computer, and record your favorite shows to watch them later Moto Scanner: A simple to use and efficient piece of software that allows you to keep a close eye on auto markets and supplies you with sale offers No Hands Proxies: With this simple and user-friendly application, you can automatically find countless working proxies and use them when browsing the web Atomic Email Studio: Complete online marketing tool that lets you send e-mails, verify and edit mailing lists, gather contacts from the Internet and local sources, and more Norconex HTTP Collector: A powerful web crawler that can also extract and manipulate documents in order to retrieve the required information on the Internet Toggl Firefox Extension: Track how much time you spend on various projects directly from your browser by turning to this lightweight Mozilla Firefox extension ProgDVB: Enables you to watch a long list of TV channels from around the world, add them to Favorites, adjust feed appearance, and comes with support for multiple devices Reader comments The Pirate Bay May Be Blocked in the EU, AG Advises more on: The Pirate Bay i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

US magistrate judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. The judge said this was because there was “no meaningful interference” with the account holder’s “possessory interest” in the data sought. “Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centres abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,” Rueter wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc, said in a statement on Saturday: “The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants.” The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that US investigators sought in a narcotics case. That decision last July 14 was welcomed by dozens of technology and media companies, privacy advocates, and both the American Civil Liberties Union and US Chamber of Commerce. On January 24, the same appeals court voted not to revisit the decision. The four dissenting judges called on the US Supreme Court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns. Both cases involved warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law that many technology companies and privacy advocates consider outdated. In court papers, Google said it sometimes breaks up emails into pieces to improve its network’s performance, and did not necessarily know where particular emails might be stored. Relying on the Microsoft decision, Google said it believed it had complied with the warrants it received, by turning over data it knew were stored in the United States. Google receives more than 25,000 requests annually from US authorities for disclosures of user data in criminal matters, according to Rueter’s ruling. tags Google Microsoft FBI Privacy laws Data privacy more from business GST Council will have to decide on Apple’s make in India demands, says govt Feb 10, 2017 20:51 IST Inside Infosys: No breakdown in corporate governance says Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw Feb 10, 2017 20:38 IST Recommended for you Presenting sponsor co-sponsor partner India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Google told to hand over foreign emails in FBI search warrant ruling Posted Feb 4, 2017 by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story 12 KPIs you must know before pitching your startup A U.S. judge has ordered Google to hand over emails stored outside the country in order to comply with an FBI search warrant. The warrant in question pertains to a domestic fraud probe. The ruling is notable because it goes against an appeals court judgement last year — recently upheld — pertaining to Microsoft customer data held in servers outside the US. In that instance a federal court ruled the company did not have to hand over data stored on its servers in Ireland to the US government, declining to “disregard the presumption against extraterritoriality,” as the judge put it. However in the Google case, U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter ruled on Friday that the act of transferring emails from a foreign server did not qualify as a seizure. According to Reuters, the judge ruled there is no “meaningful interference” with the account holder’s “possessory interest”, going on to assert that any privacy infringement occurs “at the time of disclosure in the United States”, rather than when the data itself is transferred. Google’s legal team had sought to use the Microsoft ruling as precedent to challenge the warrant’s scope. The company had turned over data that was stored in the US only. In a statement it said it will be appealing the judgement. “The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants,” it said. Both cases involve warrants issued under a 1986 federal law called the Stored Communications Act, which — as you can imagine, given its date-stamp — has long been described as a “woefully outdated” piece of legislation vs the technology it is now being used to regulate. The judge in the recent Microsoft appeals case wrote that the Act is “overdue for a congressional revision that would continue to protect privacy but would more effectively balance concerns of international comity with law enforcement needs and service provider obligations in the global context in which this case arose”. The Department of Justice certainly appears intent on applying pressure on Congress via multiple cases in the courts — pressing the question of where the line should be drawn on extraterritoriality applications to access stored data. And with the confusion of conflicting legal judgements being issued in circuit courts, there will be growing pressure for clarity — either by Congress revising the legislation, or by cases being pushed to the Supreme Court for a definitive ruling. For privacy advocates this data access tug-of-war remains one to watch. Not least given that any concrete moves to expand the scope of domestic warrants outside the US could undermine international treaties by conflicting with data protection laws elsewhere. While, on the flip side, any legal clarity limiting the jurisdiction of search warrants to data stored domestically could push US legislators towards data localization rules. In one related development late last year, Congress approved a controversial Supreme Court rule change expanding FBI search powers by enabling a judge to sign off a warrant for searches outside their own district — which could in theory be used to issue remote access warrants for the FBI to hack devices that are physically located out of their jurisdiction or even overseas. Critics argued a procedural change was being used to push through hugely expanded powers for state agents. Without a debate or any new law, the rights of every American — and basic privacy of people around the world — have been narrowed. #Rule41 https://t.co/JstitiGBgs — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 1, 2016 Featured Image: Evlakhov Valeriy/Shutterstock 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Federal Bureau of Investigation Founded 1908 Overview Federal Bureau of Investigation is a threat-based and intelligence-driven national security and law enforcement agency.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Gmail on Chrome will soon stop working on older versions of Windows and Chrome Maybe Google will finally help Microsoft kill off Windows XP 2 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Feb 4, 2017 at 18:30 GMT7 days ago If you’re using older versions of Google’s Chrome browser, soon you won’t be able to access the firm’s Gmail web app. Due to new security measured being implemented in Gmail, the site will only fully load on Chrome versions above Chrome 53, anything versions below will be redirected to a basic HTML version as early as December 2017. In a post on the official Google Blog,  Google warned: Starting February 8, 2017, we will show a banner at the top of the Gmail interface for users who are still on Google Chrome Browser v53 and below to encourage upgrading to the latest version of Chrome, currently on version 55. Chrome Browser v55 contains several important security updates. Gmail users that are still on Windows XP and Windows Vista are the most likely to be affected because v49 was the last released version which supported those operating systems. As previously announced in April 2015 and November 2015, these systems are no longer maintained by Microsoft, and we strongly encourage you to migrate to more secure and supported systems. Windows XP currently forms a relatively large proportion of Windows users with roughly 9% of users still on it at last count. Perhaps as more apps and services drop support for this positively ancient Windows version, stragglers will be forced to move on to newer and more secure versions of Windows (As for the Windows Vista users, they have our sympathy).

Google open-sources Chrome for iOS Posted Jan 31, 2017 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Elaine Chao is officially the new U.S. Secretary of Transportation Google today announced that the code for Chrome for iOS is now part of its Chromium open source project. On iOS, Chrome has to use Apple’s WebKit rendering engine instead of Google’s own Blink engine. Because of this, Google didn’t add the Chrome for iOS code to the Chromium code base before. Supporting both rendering engines in the same code base, after all, adds quite a bit of complexity. Over the last few years, though, Google’s team worked on making the necessary code changes to add the Chrome for iOS code to Chromium. That work is now complete and developers who want to compile the iOS version of Chromium can now take the iOS code from the Chromium repository and do so (assuming, of course, that they run OS X and use Xcode). Google argues that this move also means that the development speed for Chrome for iOS will now be faster, thanks to the fact that all of the tests the team runs on Chromium can now also automatically run on the Chrome for iOS code base, too. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Visual search startup Clarifai beefs up its AI team with a new San Francisco office Posted Feb 2, 2017 by Matthew Lynley (@mattlynley) 0 SHARES Next Story Snapchat reportedly hit 160M daily users and $400M revenue in 2016 Clarifai — a startup that gives companies and developers a way to implement visual search into their products — said today it was hiring former Google Brain developer Andrea Frome as the company’s new head of research. Frome received her Ph. D. from Berkeley and worked at Google for more than seven years — 3 years of which were working on street view figuring out how to blur out faces and license plates among other tasks. Frome then worked on the Google Brain team, which was applying deep learning to computer vision and search. So the problems that she had worked on clearly fit into the same bucket as the ones Clarifai is looking to solve. She will be based in San Francisco, where the company is opening a new office and starting to expand beyond their New York presence. “Going back to Google or a large company, there’s a lot of exciting things happening, but they’re packed their groups so full it feels like you’re always stepping on someone’s toes and trying to figure out your niche,” Frome said. “One thing that’s exciting about Clarifai, we’re trying focused efforts which I find very exciting as a researcher, it motivates the things I’m gonna pay attention to and focus on. Because it’s a small nimble company it’s possible to get our hands in lots of different spaces.” Related Articles Clarifai raises $30M to give developers visual search capabilities Pinterest begins rolling out search ads for keywords and shopping campaigns Pinterest has lowered its hiring goals for women in engineering roles SoundHound raises $75M to bring its voice-enabled AI everywhere Clarifai gives developers tools for tagging metadata to photos and enable the company to algorithmically learn what kinds of objects are in those photos. With that data, developers are able to train algorithms to search for those objects in photos or video or input their own content to search for objects. The company raised $30 million in October last year in a round led by Menlo Ventures, with Union Square Ventures, Lux Capital and others participating, and has raised a total of $41.25 million in financing. These are problems that larger companies like Pinterest and Google are working on, but for the time being those companies are keeping the tools in-house. Clarifai instead is trying to build a set of products that opens up the kinds of visual search tools those companies have to any startup or larger partner. Clarifai, too, is trying to be a neutral player — giving companies a set of tools they can use without feeling pressure that data is being shared with competitors or forcing companies to duct tape themselves to an experience powered by something like Google in order to have access to visual search. “Research is a really unique team at Clarifai, it’s differentiated on our organizational structure,” Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler said. “We have a structure that’s a grid — each row is a skill set. The columns are products. Research is not underneath any of those columns, it’s off the grid and to the right. The reason for that is we don’t want them tied to product and getting customer feedback and only driven by those KPIs. We want it to be much more long-term focus.” After a brief stint at a healthcare startup and working on the Hillary Clinton campaign she ended up at the top of a pile of photos in newsletter following a dinner event, grabbing Zeiler’s attention and prompting the start of the conversation. Zeiler and Frome briefly overlapped at Google during an internship. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Clarifai Founded 2013 Overview Clarifai provides advanced image recognition systems for customers to detect near-duplicates and visual searches.

Digital Trends Home > Health & Fitness > Google may help out with a tech-forward public… Google may help out with a tech-forward public health solution in India By Lulu Chang — January 31, 2017 4:52 PM Subscribe Share Ken Wolter/123RF Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Google is among tech companies that are looking to provide public health solutions in the fast-growing Indian market. Google is getting into government. According to a report from The Economic Times, the tech giant is in talks with the Indian government regarding a public health sector partnership. Should a collaboration come to fruition, Google would offer a tech-based solution to help officials collect and analyze health data more efficiently. Included in these solutions would be mobile apps to replace the paperwork that is currently needed for data intake. Moreover, Google would provide a standardized platform for tracking, maintaining, and sharing health data. Apparently, the Mountain View, California-based company began considering public health proposals after surveying community health workers in north Karnataka and New Delhi. After discovering that workers wasted time and energy in aggregating data, Google sought to use its technological know-how to simplify the process. More: Crowdfunded ebike provides an affordable way to go green in India According to a source, “Google wants to develop an app for [these workers] to save time, as well as to motivate them by letting them know how their reports are being acted upon.“ A government official added, “Right now, each health program we run has its own software and they are not speaking to each other. We’re looking at a comprehensive approach where huge amounts of data become shareable.” A number of tech companies have begun making their way into India’s health sector. For example, Hewlett-Packard has set up five e-Health centers in rural areas of the country, whereas Samsung is planning to equip health workers with 1,000 handheld devices to better collect health data. For the time being, however, Google is remaining tight-lipped on how it may or may not be involved in the Indian project. “It is an early-stage discussion, and we do not have anything to comment or add at this stage,” a Google spokesperson told Mashable India. But that may soon change.

In a tweet sent out earlier today, Blass says Google will launch Android Wear 2.0 and both accompanying LG smartwatches, the Watch Sport and Watch Style, one day earlier than previously expected. The company will now launch the latest version of its smartwatch operating system on Wednesday, February 8th, instead of Thursday, February 9th as previously reported.   Update: the launch of both the watches and the platform have been moved up a day, to February 8th. *checks dumbwatch* Hey, that’s soon! https://t.co/dzG6YPc4kp — Evan Blass (@evleaks) February 4, 2017 In his usual terse tweeting style, Blass doesn’t provide a reason for the scheduling change. Google announced Android Wear 2.0 at its 2016 I/O developer conference. The company initially planned to release update last year before it decided to delay the launch into 2017. Most of the new features scheduled to arrive alongside the update aim to help lessen the dependency Android Wear smartwatches have on a user’s smartphone.

This comes after Google delayed the official release of the wearable operating system that we got our first look at last summer at Google I/O. The official announcement was rumored to take place on February 9, but now we are hearing that Google has moved up their timeframe and will release the final build of Android Wear 2.0 and LG’s brand new smartwatches on February 8… The news of the date change comes from the famed leaker, Evan Blass. Blass was the individual who originally leaked the February 9 date for the release of Android Wear 2.0 and his knowledge on LG’s watch offerings has been pretty spot on up until this point. To recap, the Android Wear 2.0 update is going to move smartwatches away from being dependent on our smartphones. This means standalone apps with the addition of its own Google Play Store, support to do more over Wi-Fi and cellular radios, a complete redesign of its user interface, and so much more that you can read about here. LG’s new smartwatches — made in conjunction with Google — will be the Watch Sport and Watch Style. The Sport will be the bigger and more rugged of the two watches and is rumored to come with cellular connectivity. The Style will be the smaller of the two featuring a 42mm watchface but will only be able to use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to receive data. Both of these watches will have a physical button that is rumored to also act as a digital crown for navigating the watch’s interface as well as Google Assistant built-in. Update: the launch of both the watches and the platform have been moved up a day, to February 8th. *checks dumbwatch* Hey, that's soon! https://t.co/dzG6YPc4kp — Evan Blass (@evleaks) February 4, 2017 Guides Android Wear View THe Guide LG View THe Guide LG Watch Style View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo By Jonathan Stempel A U.S. judge has ordered Google to comply with search warrants seeking customer emails stored outside the United States, diverging from a federal appeals court that reached the opposite conclusion in a similar case involving Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. The judge said this was because there was "no meaningful interference" with the account holder's "possessory interest" in the data sought. "Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States," Rueter wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), said in a statement on Saturday: "The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants." The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that U.S. investigators sought in a narcotics case. That decision last July 14 was welcomed by dozens of technology and media companies, privacy advocates, and both the American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On Jan. 24, the same appeals court voted not to revisit the decision. The four dissenting judges called on the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns. Both cases involved warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law that many technology companies and privacy advocates consider outdated. In court papers, Google said it sometimes breaks up emails into pieces to improve its network's performance, and did not necessarily know where particular emails might be stored. Relying on the Microsoft decision, Google said it believed it had complied with the warrants it received, by turning over data it knew were stored in the United States. Google receives more than 25,000 requests annually from U.S. authorities for disclosures of user data in criminal matters, according to Rueter's ruling. The cases are In re: Search Warrant No. 16-960-M-01 to Google and In re: Search Warrant No. 16-1061-M to Google, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Nos. 16-mj-00960, 16-mj-01061.

The junk drawer. Tucked away in some corner. The one that has not been opened in over a decade. The one where we threw all our electronic junk over the decades. You’ll find all kinds of stuff there. Old floppy disks, CDs, charging cables and ethernet wires. Chances are you’ll also find an old feature phone in there, most probably a Nokia. The one that you once dropped out of a moving bus. The one you used to play Snake on. Switch it on. It will make that jiggling noise and come to life. Hand it over to a five-year-old and watch the eyes narrow suspiciously. “What is this?” he’ll ask. Then he’ll understand. “Ah, a phone.” He’ll touch the screen and realise it doesn’t work like that. Within five seconds he will figure out that you need to use the buttons. Then he’ll start looking for YouTube Kids, Minecraft, anything remotely familiar. Then it dawns on him. “Where’s the App Store?” There’s no app store, nor are there any apps. Tell him he can’t check out the latest trailer for Cars 3. Or that he can’t play music on Apple Music. “This is stupid,” he’ll say before throwing your beloved Nokia out of a window. He’ll look at you as if you’re a pre-historic dinosaur. “Yes, son,” you think. “We lived like barbarians without apps.”    Essentials   Authy (iOS, Android, web)   Ask experts why the US Presidential race turned out the way it did and they’ll say because of one silly mistake—not securing email accounts by turning on two-factor authentication. Authy is the best authenticator app. Supporting almost all major multi-factor authentication accounts such as Gmail, Facebook, Amazon and Dropbox, it uses secure cloud backups and multi-device synchronisation to keep you safe from hackers.  BHIM (iOS, Android)   BHIM should have happened long before the country pulled most of its currency from the streets. While there are many digital wallets, the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) is your best bet if you don’t want to trust private companies with your money. Using the government’s Unified Payment Interface (UPI), BHIM lets users send, receive and request money using an interface that is simple enough to use while being secure and fast. Houseparty (iOS, Android)  Houseparty is the first great group video- calling app. It allows up to eight people to chat simultaneously.

Described by its developers as a “synchronous social network”, Houseparty will let you have the most chaotic group video chats from wherever you are. Weather 1Weather (iOS, Android)    1Weather does all the things that a normal weather app does, such as  hourly and weekly forecasts.

Obino (iOS, Android)      Obino, one of the few diet trackers capable of tracking Indian foods, will help you lose weight and stay fit using recommendations from expert dieticians. Once you tell the app about yourself and your goals, Obino will come up with personalised fitness regimens along with diet plans. My Swim Pro (iOS, Apple Watch, Android)   MySwimPro gives access to eight swimming workouts and helps you log all your swimming exercises. With hundreds of workouts with videos and the ability to track and share progress, My Swim Pro is a must-have app for anyone who wants to make swimming an integral part of their workout regimen.  Travel   Google Trips (iOS, Android)   Google Trips, the search giant’s newest app, is a neat blend of a trip planner and travel guide. Trips not only organises your plane tickets and hotel reservations just like a good planner app would do, but will also give you detailed guides to more than 200 cities around the world along with personalised recommendations depending on your tastes. And all of those can be accessed offline.  Trusted Contacts (Android) Trusted Contacts is Google’s answer to Apple’s Find My Friends. It lets you share your contact information with anyone you trust and lets your friends and family request your status in an emergency. Failure to reply to the request within five minutes will automatically broadcast your location to your trusted contacts so they can come to your rescue. Polarsteps (iOS, Android) Polarsteps is an automatic travel logger that uses GPS to track your route and make an interactive world map of your travels.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Google Paid Out $3 Million To Bug Hunters In 2016 FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Azeem Ullah 1 week ago Google has revealed that it paid $3 million to bounty-hunters, or bug finders in 2016 alone. Hackers who found vulnerabilities, originated from 59 countries, discovered more than a thousand security loopholes in Google products, including Chrome, Android, and more. The company had previously paid $2 million to developers in 2015, which was considerably higher than $1.5 million of the year before. To date, the company has paid developers about $9 million on finding security bugs in Google’s products ever since the program began in 2010. The bugs, which varied in their critical level, also varied with the amount of payout. Starting from considerably smaller sums, they went to $100,000 for a single vulnerability, which was paid out when a developer accepted a challenge to hack a ChromeBook. This figure doesn’t necessarily indicate that Google products are getting buggier with time, but instead, that Google has been paying out much more than before. That ChromeBook hack, for instance, originally paid out $50,000, a figure which has since been increased to get more of people’s time (which eventually did lead to a successful attempt). Similar programs for Chrome have reaped rewards in the range of $30,000, which is making bounty hunting an increasingly lucrative market to be in. Programs encouraging bounty hunting have been on the rise other than Google as well. Facebook, for instance, has paid $5 million to developers until now, with most hunters belonging to India, US and Mexico. These programs not only encourage developers to find flaws; the problems identified also help raise security standards in end products.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory A U.S. judge has ordered Google to comply with search warrants seeking customer emails stored outside the United States, diverging from a federal appeals court that reached the opposite conclusion in a similar case involving Microsoft Corp. U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. The judge said this was because there was “no meaningful interference” with the account holder’s “possessory interest” in the data sought. “Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,” Rueter wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc , said in a statement on Saturday: “The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants.” The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that U.S. investigators sought in a narcotics case. That decision last July 14 was welcomed by dozens of technology and media companies, privacy advocates, and both the American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On Jan. 24, the same appeals court voted not to revisit the decision. The four dissenting judges called on the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns. Both cases involved warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law that many technology companies and privacy advocates consider outdated. In court papers, Google said it sometimes breaks up emails into pieces to improve its network’s performance, and did not necessarily know where particular emails might be stored. Relying on the Microsoft decision, Google said it believed it had complied with the warrants it received, by turning over data it knew were stored in the United States. Google receives more than 25,000 requests annually from U.S. authorities for disclosures of user data in criminal matters, according to Rueter’s ruling. The cases are In re: Search Warrant No. 16-960-M-01 to Google and In re: Search Warrant No. 16-1061-M to Google, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Nos. 16-mj-00960, 16-mj-01061.

The evidence suggest they have. You see it on signs at every protest or riot — liberals accuse President Donald Trump of being a fascist. The word’s association with Adolf Hitler and its use now is no accident, it’s meant to strike fear in people’s hearts of tyranny. Merriam-Webster defines the word “fascism” as “a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.” The secondary definition is “a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control.” This definition reflects the fact that Nazis were, in fact, both fascists and of the political left. They were the “National Socialist German Workers Party,” which favored a heavy-handed government in business and the personal lives of its citizens. The authoritarian government of Nazi Germany not only oppressed opposing political views and used violence to enforce it, they supported a powerful central government which heaped social benefits on its citizens. The second part of Nazism is the “socialist” part, which is very similar to what the modern American political left advocates. For all their bluster to the contrary, Hitler was a man of the extreme left, and so was fellow fascist and Axis Powers member Benito Mussolini. But if you type the word into Google, the definition they provide is quite different. The world’s largest search engine pins fascism on the political right, not the left. Google defines fascism as, “an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.” (emphasis added) The secondary definition is, “(in general use) extreme right-wing, authoritarian, or intolerant views or practice.” That’s a striking difference from how the word has been defined for decades. Screen capture from Google Political conservatives advocate for small, less intrusive government where power rests with the states and individuals, and the federal government lives within its Constitutional restraints. Progressive liberals advocate for just the opposite: a powerful central government with authority vested in a strong leader who has the ability to impose decrees from Washington on everything from health care to education. Google curiously adds “right-wing” to its definition and omits the “severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition” part. By the traditional Merriam-Webster definition of “severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition,” the violent mobs protesting and rioting over President Trump’s actions are the ones engaging in fascistic tactics. The exact reason Google has changed the definition of fascism to reflect on the political right rather than the left is unknown. However, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, one of the world’s richest men, has been a vocal critic of President Trump, an activist liberal, and has protested the President’s executive order on immigration.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter in Philadelphia ruled on Friday that transferring emails from a foreign server so FBI agents could review them locally as part of a domestic fraud probe did not qualify as a seizure. The judge said this was because there was "no meaningful interference" with the account holder's "possessory interest" in the data sought. "Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States," Rueter wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc, said in a statement on Saturday: "The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants." The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that U.S. investigators sought in a narcotics case. That decision last July 14 was welcomed by dozens of technology and media companies, privacy advocates, and both the American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On Jan. 24, the same appeals court voted not to revisit the decision. The four dissenting judges called on the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns. Both cases involved warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law that many technology companies and privacy advocates consider outdated. In court papers, Google said it sometimes breaks up emails into pieces to improve its network's performance, and did not necessarily know where particular emails might be stored. Relying on the Microsoft decision, Google said it believed it had complied with the warrants it received, by turning over data it knew were stored in the United States. Google receives more than 25,000 requests annually from U.S. authorities for disclosures of user data in criminal matters, according to Rueter's ruling. The cases are In re: Search Warrant No. 16-960-M-01 to Google and In re: Search Warrant No. 16-1061-M to Google, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Nos. 16-mj-00960, 16-mj-01061.

"Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States," Rueter wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc, said in a statement on Saturday: "The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants." The ruling came less than seven months after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Microsoft could not be forced to turn over emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland that U.S. investigators sought in a narcotics case. That decision last July 14 was welcomed by dozens of technology and media companies, privacy advocates, and both the American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On Jan. 24, the same appeals court voted not to revisit the decision. The four dissenting judges called on the U.S. Supreme Court or Congress to reverse it, saying the decision hurt law enforcement and raised national security concerns. Both cases involved warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law that many technology companies and privacy advocates consider outdated. In court papers, Google said it sometimes breaks up emails into pieces to improve its network's performance, and did not necessarily know where particular emails might be stored. Relying on the Microsoft decision, Google said it believed it had complied with the warrants it received, by turning over data it knew were stored in the United States. Google receives more than 25,000 requests annually from U.S. authorities for disclosures of user data in criminal matters, according to Rueter's ruling. The cases are In re: Search Warrant No. 16-960-M-01 to Google and In re: Search Warrant No. 16-1061-M to Google, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Nos. 16-mj-00960, 16-mj-01061.

INNOVATE If You Want To Build An Innovative Culture, You Need These 4 Things We tend to think innovation is about ideas, but it depends on people even more. By Greg Satell Greg Satell is a popular writer, speaker and innovation advisor. Previously, he served as Senior Vice President – Strategy & Innovation at Moxie Interactive, a division of Publicis Groupe, one of the world’s leading marketing services organizations as well as Co-CEO of KP Media, a leading publisher of magazines and websites in Ukraine, including the news magazine Korrespondent and the web portal, Bigmir. You can find Greg's blog at DigitalTonto.com. His first book, Mapping Innovation, will be published by McGraw-Hill in May. @Digitaltonto Author, Mapping Innovation@Digitaltonto 1 COMMENTS CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement fIn the late 1960's, Gary Starkweather had a serious spat with his boss. As an engineer in Xerox's long-range xerography unit, he saw that laser printing could be a huge business opportunity. His manager, however, was focused on improving the efficiency of the current product line, not looking to start another one. The argument got so heated that Starkweather's job came to be in jeopardy. Fortunately, his rabble rousing caught the attention of another division within the company, the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) which wasn't interested in efficiency, but inventing a new future and they eagerly welcomed Starkweather into their ranks. Within a decade, Xerox's copying business declined sharply, but the laser printer took off and soon became the firm's main source of revenue. In effect, the work that was squelched in one culture, thrived in another and saved the company. We tend to think innovation is about ideas, but it depends on people even more. Here are four things that create an innovative culture. 1. Focus On Problem Solving When you think about an innovative culture what probably first comes to mind is a bunch of fast moving hipsters guzzling down energy drinks and pulling all-nighters, pausing only to play a quick game of foosball or Frisbee. Or maybe Steve Jobs on stage with a devilish grin just before he wows the audience with "one more thing..." Yet in researching my book, Mapping Innovation, I found that very few of the organizations I studied looked like that. Some were fast moving startups, but most of the successful ones were led by executives that were mature and thoughtful, not brash or erratic. Others were large corporations and world class labs that tended to be fairly conservative. The one thing I found in common in every fantastically innovative place I looked at was a disciplined passion for identifying new problems. Unlike most organizations, which are content to struggle with the everyday issues that come up, the enterprises I studied had a systematic method of finding new problems to work on that would take them in new directions. The approaches vary considerably. IBM creates grand challenges, like building a computer that can beat humans at Jeopardy. Experian set up its Datalabs division to find out what's giving its customers "agita" and launch new business off the solutions they build. Google's "20 percent time" acts as a human-powered search engine for new problems. We tend to think of innovation as fast moving, but the truth is that it usually takes 30 years to go from an initial discovery to a measurable impact. So the "next big thing" is usually about 29 years old. If you want to innovate effectively, don't chase the latest trend, find a problem your customers will care about and solve it for them. 2. Safe Spaces In 2012, Google embarked on an enormous research project. Code-named "Project Aristotle," the aim was to see what made successful teams tick. They combed through every conceivable aspect of how teams worked together -- how they were led, how frequently they met outside of work, the personality types of the team members -- no stone was left unturned. However, despite Google's nearly unparalleled ability to find patterns in complex data, none of the conventional criteria seemed to predict performance. In fact, what they found mattered most to team performance was psychological safety, or the ability of each team member to be able to give voice to their ideas without fear of reprisal or rebuke. Interestingly, highly innovative teams can be safe for some ideas, but not for others. For example, two of the scientists at PARC, Dick Shoup and Alvy Ray Smith, developed on a revolutionary new graphics technology called SuperPaint. Unfortunately, it didn't fit in with the PARC's vision of personal computing, the two were ostracized and eventually both left. Smith would team up with another graphics pioneer, Ed Catmull, at the New York Institute of Technology. Later they joined George Lucas, who saw the potential for computer graphics to create a new paradigm for special effects. Eventually, the operation was spun out and bought by Steve Jobs. That company, Pixar, was sold to Disney in 2006 for $7.4 billion. Xerox PARC is now a shadow of its former self. As it turned out, anything that didn't have to do with the researchers' vision for the future had no home there. So if you want to innovate consistently for the long term, you need to create a "safe space" for all ideas, not just the ones that fit with your initial mission. 3. Informal Networks In 2005, a team of researchers decided to study why some Broadway plays become hits and others flop. They looked at all the usual factors, such as production budget, marketing budget and the track record of the director, but what they found was that what was most important was informal networks of relationships among the cast and crew. If no one had ever worked together before, both financial and creative results tended to be poor. However, if the networks among the cast and crew became too dense, performance also suffered. It was the teams that had elements of both -- strong ties and new blood -- that had the greatest success. The same effect has been found elsewhere. In studies of star engineers at Bell Labs, the German automotive industry and currency traders it has been shown that tightly clustered groups, combined with long range "weak ties" that allow information to flow freely among disparate clusters of activity results in better innovation. So before you embark on your next reorganization designed to "break down silos" you might want to think about how informal relationships develop within your enterprise. The truth is that innovation is never about nodes. It's always about networks. 4. Collaboration All too often, we think of innovation as the work of lone geniuses who, in a flash of inspiration, arrive at a eureka moment. Yet the truth is that research shows that the high value work is done in teams, those teams are increasing in size, are far more interdisciplinary than in the past and the work is done at greater distances. Just as importantly, there is growing evidence that it is crucial how these teams function. A study done by the CIA performed after 9/11 to determine what attributes made for the most effective analyst teams found that what made teams successful was not the attributes of their members, or even the coaching they got from their leaders, but the interactions within the team itself. In another, more wide ranging study, scientists at MIT and Carnegie Mellon found that high performing teams are made up with people who have high social sensitivity, take turns when speaking and, surprisingly, the number of women in the group. There is also a wealth of research that shows diverse teams outperform more homogenous units. So the evidence is both abundant and clear, if you want to make your organization more innovative, don't go searching for hard driving "A" personalities spouting off big ideas and interrupting others, but rather seek diversity, empathy and to network your organization so that teams interact more effectively. As MIT's Sandy Pentland has put it, "We teach people that everything that matters happens between your ears, when in fact it actually happens between people."

Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com Nicklaus: Curbing immigration will hurt the economy By David Nicklaus St. Louis Post-Dispatch David Nicklaus Feb 5, 2017 (…) J.B. Forbes • jforbes@post-dispatch.com Protesters hold signs during a protest on Sunday, Jan. 29, 2017, at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. People had gathered to protest the new immigration policies of President Donald Trump that banned entry to people from seven Muslim countries into the United States. Photo by J.B. Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com America wouldn’t exist without immigrants, and its economic future will look bleak if we don’t keep welcoming them. That’s why so many companies, from Coca-Cola to Google, spoke out against a travel ban that affects people from seven Muslim-majority countries. It’s also why the stock market, which had been rising since President Donald Trump was elected, got nervous when he announced the ban. Contrary to some political rhetoric, immigration isn’t a zero-sum game in which “they” take “our” jobs. Joel Prakken, senior managing director at Macroeconomic Advisers in Clayton, says most research shows that immigration helps the economy by increasing the working-age population and by boosting productivity. Some of the productivity increase comes from skilled immigrants who invent things — people such as Google co-founder Sergey Brin and Tesla founder Elon Musk. It also comes from specialization: As employers hire immigrants for routine tasks, native-born employees move into jobs that make use of their language and communication skills. “You get a larger and more flexible workforce, and you get a larger economy,” Prakken said. “If you told me right now, ‘No more immigrants,’ I would cut my forecast for economic growth dramatically.” Anyone who expects to collect Social Security should be a fan of immigration. You’ll need working, taxpaying Americans to fund your benefits, and a lot of them will be born in other countries. The Census Bureau projects that over the next 30 years, more than half of the nation’s population increase will happen through immigration. By 2050, the demographers expect immigration to account for 82 percent of growth. That number, by the way, assumes a net inflow of nearly 1.5 million migrants a year by 2050. Only 1.1 million people a year can enter the country legally, so the Census Bureau is assuming that we will either get smart about immigration reform or see unauthorized entrants more than double. The former — a well-thought-out policy of making the U.S. more welcoming, especially of people with skills — is the best way to ensure prosperity in decades to come. Instead, with Trump’s travel ban and with orders he is said to be drafting that would restrict work visas and make it harder for noncitizens to get government benefits, we’re moving in the opposite direction.

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives While immigrant-rich places such as Los Angeles and New York are most affected by the travel ban, Rust Belt cities like St. Louis also have a lot to lose. With their manufacturing industries in decline and their population aging, they need the innovation and energy that foreigners can bring. After a study said a lack of immigrants was hurting St. Louis’ economy, local leaders launched the Mosaic Project in 2013. They want to make St. Louis’ immigrant population the fastest-growing among the 20 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, a goal that was met in 2015. For Betsy Cohen, Mosaic’s director, the benefits are easy to see. “The research shows that foreign-born people are more than 60 percent more likely to start a business,” she said. “They encourage neighborhood and retail viability, keeping schools open and contributing to the local economy.” Cohen said Mosaic is nonpolitical, so she wouldn’t comment on any specific policies. She noted that even in an era of restricted immigration, the region could meet its goal by convincing foreign-born residents to move here from other cities. A bigger slice of a shrinking pie wouldn’t be much of a victory, though. In a national immigration debate that’s becoming increasingly shrill and nonsensical, St. Louisans and their leaders must keep arguing for economic reason.

The data reflect safety-related incidents reported by 11 companies that have been testing more than 100 vehicles on public roads, primarily in the Silicon Valley neighborhoods where the technology has grown up. The reports were made to California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, which posted them online. A row of Google self-driving Lexus cars parade at a Google event outside the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The documents catalog the number of times from December, 2015, through the end of November that humans took over control from a car’s software for safety reasons. Waymo, as Google’s self-driving car project was recently rebranded, did far more testing than the other 10 companies combined — and had much greater success. Its fleet drove itself more than 635,000 miles with 124 safety-related “disengagements,” which must be reported when the technology fails or the backup driver takes control out of concern the car is malfunctioning. The Google project’s disengagement rate was the equivalent of two incidents every 10,000 miles, a notable decrease over the prior year, when there were eight disengagements per 10,000 miles. “This four-fold improvement reflects the significant work we’ve been doing to make our software and hardware more capable and mature,” Dmitri Dolgov, Waymo’s head of self-driving technology wrote in a blog post . Waymo’s chief critic acknowledged the improvement, but John Simpson of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog said the number of disengagements shows the cars still “simply aren’t ready to be released to roam our roads” without human backup drivers. Other companies also showed improvements. Nissan reported 28 disengagements over 4,099 miles, or 68 incidents per 10,000 miles — far better than the 106 in 1,485 miles (713 per 10,000 miles) it reported last year. Cruise Automation, a startup acquired last year by General Motors, reported driving the second most test miles this year. Cruise said its prototypes had 181 disengagements over 9,776 miles (185 per 10,000 miles) and that it was “pleased with our progress” during testing on the complex streets of San Francisco.  The company did not file numbers for 2015 because it did not have a testing permit that year. Though imperfect, the data represent the best peek the public gets into the secretive and fiercely competitive world of self-driving cars and how the prototypes are performing. California required the disengagement reports as part of regulations governing testing on public roads. When the technology will be ready for the public depends on several factors, including regulators’ readiness and company confidence the vehicles are safe. While Tesla’s Elon Musk has been bullish, talking about months rather than years, Tesla’s disengagement report said four prototypes drove a total of 550 miles last fall, experiencing 182 disengagements — the equivalent of 3,309 disengagements every 10,000 miles.

The company revealed that users should update their Google Chrome browser because Gmail will no longer be available for those with a version of the browser number 53 or lower. Alphabet announced that the move will be in motion as of February 8, which will affect Windows XP and Windows Vista users unless they update their operating system on the coming days. The company said that it decided to make the move because Google Chrome browser versions lower than 53 do not have the security features that more advanced browsers have, thus making them vulnerable to breaches. Google essentially said that there is a high chance of you facing a cyberattack if you are using Chrome v53 or lower. Additionally, there will be no bug fixes or security patches available to you any more. Other than Gmail, you will still be able to use the Chrome browser until the end of the year, but it will only exist in its basic HTML version. “Gmail users that are still on Windows XP and Windows Vista are the most likely to be affected because v49 was the last released version which supported those operating systems,” the company wrote in its blog recently. GOOG shares edged up 0.5%, while GOOGL stock wafted up 0.4%.

UC San Diego students Johnny Koo, Jared Buchanan, Han Lu Ling, Neeki Ashari, Srivaths Kalyan and Tavish Traut (left to right) are finalists in a competition that could lead them to brewing beer on the moon with the cylinder Ashari is holding. (Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego) Gary WarthContact Reporter Future space colonist some day may be thanking a team of UC San Diego students as they kick back with a tall cold one. With a plan to boldly brew where no man has brewed before, the young scientists hope to prove that it’s possible to make beer in moon’s low gravity. It may sound like a fraternity prank, but their idea is being taken seriously by an aerospace startup that is planning an actual flight to the moon this December. “I threw it out there as a joke, and then everybody starting thinking it was a really good idea,” said Han Lu Ling, 23, one of the team leaders If successful, the out-of-this-world experiment would not only result in the first lunar brew, but also could lead to future colonies baking bread, making medicine and doing other things that require yeast, one of the key ingredients in beer. The  UC San Diego team Original Gravity --- the name comes from a brewing term — consists of leaders Ling, Neeki Ashari, 22, and Srivaths Kaylan, 21. Students Jared Buchanan, Sebastian Kaser, Clarissa Hoffman, Seth Choi, Jeff Cash, and Tavish Traut round out the team. The Jacobs School of Engineering undergraduates are competing in the Lab2Moon competition held by TeamIndus, an India aerospace company that is planning to launch a flight to the moon Dec. 28 as part of the Google Lunar XPRIZE challenge, sometimes known as Moon 2.0. TeamIndus is one of five privately funded teams that won a $1 million Milestone Prize from Google for successfully simulating the landing technology concept of its spacecraft. The next challenge for the teams is to land a one-way rocket to the moon with a rover that can successfully travel more than 500 meters and transmit high-definition images and video back to Earth. Google will award $30 million in prizes to successful competitors, including a $20 million grand prize and $5 million second-place prize. TeamIndus was the only team that offered to take along an experiment from an outsider, and 3,500 entries were submitted. Original Gravity is one of 25 finalists. On Feb. 11, the UC San Diego team will demonstrate their experiment through Skype to TeamIndus. If successful, the three team leaders will be flown to India on March 13 to present it live in a competition to select the winner. Ashari, a self-proclaimed space geek who dreams of one day working with entrepreneur Elon Musk at SpaceX, said the team brainstormed about an experiment that could help sustain life in space after learning of the competition from professor Ranesh Rao at the Qualcomm Institute. Ling, whose parents worked as rocket scientists at NASA, is a homebrewer and suggested making beer after other ideas had been tossed out. When the laughter stopped, they began taking the idea seriously. “We started thinking about the more scientific approach of it,” Ashari said. “There’s a lot of applications for it. If yeast can survive there, then other microorganism can survive there. You can make bread on the moon. Insulin.” The idea isn’t totally unique. Astronauts aboard the International Space Station have brewed beer in zero gravity, but nobody has brewed it low gravity. Designing the brewing equipment was tricky, as the experiment will be in an unmanned craft and involve triggering the process remotely. The capsule that team Original Gravity has designed to brew beer on the moon has three parts. Once on the moon, the yeast will drop from the top compartment to a compartment below containing wort, a mixture made with barley and other ingredients.

The capsule that team Original Gravity has designed to brew beer on the moon has three parts. Once on the moon, the yeast will drop from the top compartment to a compartment below containing wort, a mixture made with barley and other ingredients. (Gary Warth) To brew the beer, the students used a 3D printer to create a three-chamber cylinder slightly smaller than a soda can. The wort, a sweet mixture of barley, hops and other ingredients, will be in the center chamber and the yeast will be above it. Once on the moon, the yeast will fall into the wort, eating sugar in the liquid and creating alcohol through fermentation. The process also creates carbon dioxide, which usually is released during fermentation. Students agreed that releasing CO2 in a closed environment wouldn’t be a good idea, partly because the escaping gas could knock over the rover in low gravity. By precisely measuring a small amount of yeast and wort and carefully calculating the pressure, they hope to safely carbonate their “Low Gravity Porter” without releasing any CO2. “The reason we picked a porter was because it ages well,” Ling said. “It’s a prize for whoever gets there first,” Kaylan said about the lucky astronaut who may one day be the first human to return to the moon. The team will be competing against experiments that involve radiation shields, water recycling and photosynthesis, among other topics. “People were saying to me, ‘No one’s going to pick you,” Ling said. “It’s beer, no science.” So far they’ve proved the doubters wrong, however, and the students believe they have a good chance at winning. “I thought it was so unique, it would stand out from the rest of the 3,500 other people who applied.”Ashari said. The team has received more media attention than any other in the competition, with Canadian journalists and the BBC in England among the outlets reporting on them. Kaylan said the attention they’ve brought to TeamIndus likely will help their chances. “Engineers have this stereotype of being kind of geeks, nerds,” he said. “I think using beer made this project more relatable.

Miller February 3, 2017 10 Comments Is the cloud truly a big deal for big business? The latest financial reports tell the tale: it's only going to get bigger. All of the major vendors of cloud systems have now come out with their financials for the end of and the reports continue to shine new light on just how quickly business workloads are moving to the cloud. Consider: Amazon said that in the fourth quarter the revenues from its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit topped $3.5 billion, up 47 percent from the same quarter a year ago, and annual revenue was $12.2 billion, up 55 percent. That's a huge leap, even if it's less than the 69 percent growth it saw last year, disappointing investors. The company is now on a $14 billion annual run rate, which is pretty impressive. Microsoft as well showed impressive numbers and said its "commercial cloud revenue" run rate grew to more than $14 billion, up 49 percent, suggesting quarterly revenues of about $3.5 billion. This makes the two essentially tied in total cloud revenue, though Amazon's offerings are predominately infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS), while Microsoft offers both of those (as part of its Azure offering), as well as software-as-a-service (SaaS) in the form of Office 365 and Dynamics 365. (Microsoft doesn't break out specific numbers for these products, though it did say that Office 365 seats grew 37 percent year-over-year and that commercial revenue increased 47 percent. That indicates to me that more people are moving to the SaaS platform. Microsoft does have a category for "Intelligent Cloud," where revenue was $6.9 billion, but that includes both Azure and on-premises software such as Windows Server.) Google parent Alphabet doesn't break out its Google Cloud Platform, seen by most observers as the third largest IaaS and PaaS provider. It instead includes Google Cloud Platform within an "other revenue" category that also includes hardware and the Play Store; these together amount to $3.4 billion. I've seen estimates of Google Cloud Platform having an annual revenue of just above $1 billion, but that number isn't confirmed. All of these services offer the basic infrastructure services such as multiple types of compute instances and storage types, as well as a variety of platform services, from databases to services to a wide array of functions or microservices. Amazon often references the sheer breadth of its services, while Microsoft often talks about how it works well in hybrid environments, with workloads mixed among cloud and on-premises solutions. Google has really emphasized data analytics, security tools, and application development. All three have been touting new machine learning and AI tools. IBM usually isn't counted in the top three anymore, but its numbers suggest it may deserve to be there. The company reports a variety of cloud numbers. Overall IBM said for the year it had cloud revenues of $13.7 billion, up 35 percent, but that number includes all sorts of things—even some hardware. IBM said total "as-a-service" annual run rate was $8.6 billion, up 63 percent, and that the cloud portion of its "technology services and cloud platforms segment" accounted for $1.8 billion in the quarter, though that number includes integration services as well as what most of the industry would call IaaS or PaaS. (In addition, it reported $0.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue in its cognitive solutions segment, which includes Watson and some cloud-based analytics, though much of that would normally be classified as SaaS.) Oracle, which reports off cycle, said in the three months ending November 30 it had a total cloud revenue of $1.053 billion, including $175 million in IaaS services, and $878 in PaaS and SaaS. Its numbers show a big increase in the latter category, up 81 percent from a year ago; but little increase in IaaS, up only 6 percent. While Oracle has talked about challenging Amazon in infrastructure-as-a-service, it still seems to have a long way to go. Among the major players, there is also Alibaba's cloud division, which said it recorded cloud revenues of $254 million for the fourth quarter, up 115 percent vs. the previous quarter. The company has been strong in and recently announced a large international expansion. All of this indicates that there is still massive growth happening in companies moving workloads to the cloud, whether these are new workloads or those being migrated from traditional on-premises infrastructure. Despite the growth, recall that the total IT market is much, much larger—by itself, IBM's total revenue of nearly $22 billion in the quarter is larger than all of the true cloud infrastructure players combined. (The most recent quarterly revenues of the other big infrastructure players were nearly as large: Dell Technologies at $16.2 billion, and Cisco and HPE at about $12.4 billion each.) Just about every CIO I talk to is either in the process of moving some workloads to the cloud or at least considering it, while very few outside of the startup world completed the process. All of the signs indicate that cloud computing migration continues to pick up steam. Michael J. Miller is chief information officer at Ziff Brothers Investments, a private investment firm.

By Staff Reporter (staff@latinpost.com) First Posted: Feb 04, 2017 08:05 AM EST Share This Tweet This Google Developers Event Held In San Francisco(Photo : Getty Images) Share This Tweet This The new Android OS will eventually release this coming May 2017 and there's a lot of rumor about what will be the name of the new OS, it could be Android 8 or something that begins with a letter 'O'. Some guess in a pattern since Google applies it every year updates. According to PC Advisor, every one of us notices that Android OS choose names from candies or chocolates and it also alphabetical order. Since they update in a sequence chronologically, this new OS will be on a numerical denomination and it will be likely called Android 8.0 or Android 8. Google has had a tradition of releasing annual Android updates - its last update Android Nougat - was released in August 2016. As 2017 commences, we get closer to the launch of the next Android update, which is likely to start with the letter O, going by Google's tradition of naming its operating system (OS) updates alphabetically with names of desserts.  Advertisement Many items begin with the letter 'O' the most closed one to pick is Oreo. The famous biscuit in the world. If the Google will push the name of Oreo, they need to have a partnership with the manufacturer of Oreo which is Mondelez. The last agreement that they sign was on Nestle for the official used of Android Kitkat. Other expected names include Orange, Oatcake, Ox-tongue Pastry, Oatmeal Cookie and Orellete. However, until now, Google Android hasn't given out any clues regarding the update. Last January 9, 2017, Android OS find an issue about fragmentation that there are still Gingerbread devices running and if you are running out of budget you will never get the latest Android OS, Digital Trends has learned. In line with this, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the new hardware will release this coming October 2017. This will be the first phone from Google but there would be a new developer that will announce in Google I/0. Android 8.0 or Android 8 will officially be released on May 17-19, 2017. As of now, the latest OS is yet to be given a sweet name.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Open GApps makes Google Assistant available, adds option during install By John Hoff - February 4, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Officially, the Google Assistant feature of Android Nougat is still locked to supported devices such as the Google Pixel phones, Google Home, and the NVIDIA SHIELD TV 2017 device. Of course, after-market software developers have made it available for more devices via other ways, the simplest of which was to edit the build.prop file to make the installation work. Now Open GApps is making it easier for you. Editing the build.prop file in Nougat is probably one of the easiest mods you can do to your device. But the developers of Open GApps – one of the more popular Google Apps package providers for custom ROM users – is now willing to do that for you by giving you the option to enable Google Assistant suring installation, thereby negating the need for manually editing the build.prop file. Please remember though, that Google Assistant has not yet fully and officially replaced Google Now in unsupported devices, so it will probably be missing a few of its features. This is why Open GApps is asking you if you want it or not during installation. Given that, it is still good to have this option available for those who want to take advantage of it. The option to enable Google Assistant will be available in the next build of OpenGapps, starting February 3 and onwards. Users will be prompted to enable the build.prop modification while in the AROMA installation environment.

Tinfoil hats aren't my scene. But watch out! In just the past month, the internet and smartphones have come up with five new and surprising ways to steal or expose our personal data. Of course, these new concerns can now be added to all the old ones. Companies like Google and Facebook still track you and harvest personal data. Hackers still want to steal your data. And the National Security Agency is still out there doing its thing. And now, these five new trends reveal that your security and privacy could be compromised in ways you probably never imagined. 1. Fingerprints can be stolen from selfies Researchers at Japan's National Institute of Informatics (NII) announced recently that your fingerprints could be stolen from photos of your fingers, and the prints could then be re-created and used to bypass biometric security systems. Smartphone cameras have gotten so good, so high-resolution, that the ridges and valleys that make up your unique fingerprints could be copied and used to foil fingerprint security schemes. This is a special threat for Japan, where flashing the "V sign" or "peace sign" with the hands is a common gesture in photographs posted online. Skeptics are skeptical. For starters, the "researchers" were hawking a ridiculous "solution" to the problem -- a clear titanium oxide film with a specific pattern printed on it that you would somehow place on your fingers to cover your prints before taking a selfie. Also: Conditions have to be just right. The fingers must be in focus, the lighting must be perfect, the distance from the camera must be about nine feet and the photographer must use a very high-end smartphone. (And such phones typically focus on the face, not the fingers.) Mike Elgan The high-resolution versions of photos like these of the author's own hands could be used to copy fingerprints. But I think the skeptics are wrong. You should worry. First, fingerprint-photo theft has already been demonstrated. Two years ago, a German named Jan Krissler re-created the fingerprints of German defense minister Ursula von der Leyen from publicly available photos and made a 3D mold of her finger that could unlock a smartphone. Second, the technology already exists. No additional research is necessary. Third, fingerprints are forever and cannot be changed, so stealing fingerprints isn't like stealing a password, which can be changed. Fourth, smartphone cameras keep getting better. It's only a matter of time before most people carry cameras at least as good as the best found in the iPhone 7 or the Samsung Galaxy S7. And finally, hackers can use online photos as the starting point, rather than targeting specific people. It could be difficult to target a specific person, because you'd have to go looking for high-quality photos of that person's fingers. But if your starting point is all the high-resolution photos of fingers on, say, Google Images, then you could potentially harvest hundreds of thousands of prints efficiently. I've scanned my own private Google Photos trove and found plenty of fingerprint-friendly photos. If I had made them public, a malicious and resourceful person could use multiple photos to re-create my fingerprints. 2. Political trolls 'win arguments' by publishing your personal data In this heated political season, with vitriol lobbed from one filter bubble to the next, acrimony rules the social web. The latest trend in online political arguments is doxing, which is the act of exposing someone's personal information online. Some kinds of information, such as phone numbers and home addresses, are easy to find online and also conducive to harassment. One hater doxes, and a hundred others call with death or bomb threats or engage in swatting, where you call the police and falsely report that a violent confrontation is underway at someone's home, leading the police to send the SWAT team to that address. The problem recently got so serious on Reddit that the site deleted and banned the r/altright and r/alternativeright subreddits. Reddit was unable to curb doxing in the subreddits in the usual ways, so it resorted to the nuclear option and terminated them. Sadly, doxable personal information is trivially easy to find online because... 3. Genealogy sites have already posted your personal information online Personal information sites, including genealogy and "people search" sites, have been around for years. The business model has long been to tease people with the kinds of information the sites could provide, and then require interested parties to pay to get the full set of data. But now, two trends have popped up that should freak you out. The first is the emergence of a personal information super site called Family Tree Now. The site gives away free the kind of information that others have been charging for. This caused a great deal of concern last month after a woman tweeted about the previously obscure site. If you simply enter a name and the state where that person lives, Family Tree Now can often tell you the individual's other family members, along with their ages and current and previous home addresses. The second trend is that some "people search" sites use social engineering to get you to give them information, instead of the other way around. For example, the site TruthFinder asks questions throughout the process, claiming that your answers will help it give you better data. In fact, TruthFinder is getting information from you. Screenshot/Mike Elgan Some "people finder" websites make a dramatic show of searching databases to tell you information about someone — but as they do that, they pepper you with questions so they can add your answers to their databases. 4. Mobile apps send personal data back to a remote server A Chinese selfie-editing iPhone app called Meitu transforms your face into a surreal cartoon image that whitens, brightens, enlarges the eyes and adds visual effects. Two weeks ago, the app exploded in popularity because the effects are so unusual and over the top. It turns your face into a dreamy cartoon character. But overnight, it emerged that the app sends all kinds of information back to China, including your location, details about your mobile carrier and IP address, and the IMEI numbers of Android users. The company responded to online outrage by saying it doesn't sell the data and uses it only to improve the app. The controversy raised awareness about an uncomfortable fact, which is that many apps harvest your data without your knowledge or explicit permission. So what's the solution? Security apps? Unfortunately... 5. Even security apps can threaten your security One of the best ways to protect one's privacy online is to use a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs theoretically let you use the public internet as if you were on a private network. They let you hide and encrypt your online activity, even from your own ISP. And they enable you to spoof your location, so you can say you're going online in another city or country. However, a recent study found that an alarmingly high number of VPN services offered through Android apps violate your privacy, rather than protect it. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of South Wales in Australia, found that 38% of Android VPNs are infected with malware, 18% don't have encryption and 75% track user activity. Some Android VPNs inject JavaScript programs for tracking or for redirecting online shopping queries to paid partners of the app creator. What to do about the new privacy and security threats You've heard the standard best practices for protecting your privacy. Turn on two-factor authentication whenever and wherever you can. Use a password manager like LastPass. Download apps only when they've been recommended by a credible authoritative reviewer. But given these new threats to privacy and security, I would recommend the following additional steps. First, sign up for a site called "Have I Been Pwned?" It will alert you when your personal information shows up online as the result of a hack. Often hackers crack a site, download all the user data, then post it or sell it on the dark web. Second, try to think of all the sites you signed up for but later abandoned. Go back and actively delete your account. Third, consider disinformation. Whenever a site wants personal data, give fake information. If your information gets hacked, doxed or exposed, your real information won't be used. Fourth, search through your photos looking for images of hands and fingers and make sure no usable fingerprints exist. Fifth, don't get into heated arguments with trolls, haters or political extremists online. Sixth, go to Family Tree Now and remove your personal information. The internet is always coming up with new ways to violate your privacy and security. But you can fight back. A little paranoia goes a long way. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The California-based Internet giant is reportedly removing the Google Now Launcher from the Play store, while the Pixel Launcher will still be available but only for Pixel smartphones. The move is said to happen at the end of Q1 i.e. March this year, however those who already have Google Now Launcher installed will continue receiving updates from Google. In an email sent to GMS partners, Google explains that Google Now Launcher will be discontinued over the timeline starting Q1 2017 wherein it will be unpublished from the Google Play store - however it will continue receiving updates via the Google App for Android. This could be indication that there will be no major updates coming to the Google Now Launcher, but just few tweaks here and there inside it. In addition to that, according to the email, starting 1 March 2017, the Google Now Launcher will also be removed from Google Mobile Services (GMS), which are used by OEMs to build their own Android device. New devices with Google Now Launcher will not be approved by Google but there's a way out for OEM partners who would have to use Google's Search Launcher Services library for their own stock launchers. The Google Search Launcher Services library has been under testing for a while and it's now available for OEM partners to use. This will let the OEMs append Google Now panel as the leftmost screen of their launchers. Sony is already making the use of this service for its launchers. However, the OEMs that use Google Now Launcher as a default launcher in their devices, like Moto smartphones, will have to obtain the Launcher3 from Android Open Source Project (AOSP) paired with Search Launcher Services library, and add the search services, or develop a brand-new launcher. That said, it's also uncertain about what Google has planned for the Nexus devices that also rely on the Google Now Launcher. Anyway, the third-party app launchers like Nova Launcher, Go Launcher can be alternatively used as well. As we mentioned, one of the two launchers from Google - Pixel Launcher - will still be available, but only for the Pixel smartphone users. There's no information whether Google is planning to open use of Pixel Launcher by other devices.

Name: Subject: Message: Stop me if you’ve seen this Google Home Super Bowl ad before Newsby Kris Carlon7 days ago 10 292 7 If you’re willing to fork over the millions of dollars it takes to air your ad during the Super Bowl, conventional wisdom has it that you should probably invest just as much in making an exciting new ad to capture the hearts and minds of those watching. Google seems to have missed that memo though, and will be airing its original Google Home ad – which is almost a half a year old – during the big game tomorrow. See also: Watch two Google Home speakers share a deep conversation January 6, 2017 Google’s original ad, which has been viewed over a million times already on YouTube, was uploaded on October 4, 2016. The exact same ad was just uploaded again with a new title: Google Home 2017 Super Bowl commercial. We know times are tough, what with Alphabet shares down and all, but re-airing an old ad during the Super Bowl is a bit boring. Especially when the ad fails to even mention Netflix integration, possibly Home’s coolest new feature, which was sorely lacking at launch. That said, Google is obviously less interested in entering the Super Bowl ad hall of fame than in getting its Home speaker in front of 110 million people. It’s pretty safe to say that anyone with a passing interest in connected speakers has already seen Google’s ad for Home, but Super Bowl LI will expose it to a lot more potential customers. That alone seems to be justification enough for Google to drop the $10 million it will cost to air the one-minute commercial. Still, it’s a shame we won’t see Google making an ad specifically for the Super Bowl, because that would have been awesome. Super Bowl LI will take place in Houston tomorrow between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons. If you want to know how to stream the big game, take a look at your options in our Super Bowl LI streaming guide. Who will win? Pats or Falcons? Home or Alexa?

Except, in a twist of fate, we’ve been granted the power of foresight, and have used it to see into the future of smartphones. No, we didn’t get bitten by a radioactive spider or suffer a risky experiment-gone-wrong. We just used two concept-style phones that are way ahead of their time: the Xiaomi Mi Mix and the Honor Magic The phones in question aren’t nailed together concepts that’ll never be sold, either. They’re genuine examples of next-generation phone tech that you can buy today. What makes them so futuristic? Both incorporate technology that’s so cutting edge, we haven’t seen it implemented in the same way on any other device. However, there are strong indications big-name manufacturers are working hard to bring the same tech to 2017’s major flagship smartphones. We’ve seen the future, and you can, too. China, hot bed of phone innovation? The Xiaomi Mi Mix and the Honor Magic may be unfamiliar names to many of you, and that’s because you can’t buy either of them through official channels unless you live in China. You can get these futuristic phones through importer services if you’re a real die-hard, and both are currently on sale in China. People complain endlessly that smartphone innovation is dead and all the phones look the same. Ironically, China is often viewed as the worst copycat for taking liberties with other company’s designs, and the amount of iPhone imitators that pop up almost daily borders on the laughable. Look deeper, and China has had the jump on several major mobile technologies adopted by international companies over the past years, from diverse chat app platforms to online video live streaming. Chinese phone manufacturers have been coming up with some exciting devices recently, too. From the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro’s use of Google Tango to Oppo’s teased hyper fast battery charging technology, Chinese tech companies are innovating fast. You really shouldn’t be shocked that it’s not Apple, Samsung, LG, or another big-name manufacturer that’s leading the latest round of innovation at all. These two phones are really different Let’s examine these phones, and why we think they’ve just fallen out of a door pocket in Marty McFly’s DeLorean. The Xiaomi Mi Mix has a 6.4-inch, almost bezel-less touchscreen inside a phone that’s no bigger than the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. There’s no speaker and no proximity sensor to breakup the expanse, making it look totally unique. We’ve seen borderless screens before — on everything from the Galaxy S7 Edge to the Nubia Z11 — but this time it’s done right. The specially engineered screen curves at the corners, hides a speaker system that is “heard” through the glass itself, and embeds a sonar-like ultrasonic proximity sensor under the glass. The result is a unique, beautiful design, made possible using brand-new technology. artificial intelligence borderless screen smartphones xiaomi mi mix reviewMore Andy Boxall/Digital Trends artificial intelligence borderless screen smartphones honor magic ho bodyMore Read More Honor’s lozenge-shape Magic is equally stunning to look at. When you get to handle that ultra-curvy shape, you’ll wonder why all phones aren’t styled in the same way. However, it’s Honor’s use of artificial intelligence which makes it so futuristic. The AI goes beyond Siri and Google Now, integrating itself into the operating system and behaving more like chat bots do in Facebook Messenger. The phone will make helpful suggestions based on your activity, including what movies are playing at a theater close to you or ordering a cab if you’re out late at a bar or club. It even shields lock screen notifications from others, revealing them only to you, because it knows what you look like. More: Hands-on with the Honor Magic It’s so slick, you’d think Honor had been using such deep artificial intelligence integration for years. Similarly, the Mi Mix makes superb use of its massive, wide touchscreen, plus the audio system behind the screen works so well, it’s easy to forget we’ve never seen this type of display technology before. The borderless future? Are we just relying on a crystal ball here, or is there any actual evidence these two phones represent a vision of the future? There’s plenty. Let’s talk about borderless screens first, which is the next step in making screens bigger, without making phone bodies larger and more cumbersome. It’s all about screen-to-body ratio, and the higher the percentage, the better. Rumors of a bezel-less Apple iPhone have spread for a while, and the reports are now connected to the iPhone 8, whenever it may arrive. Reports say the new screen is part of a radical redesign, which will transfer the trademark Home button into the screen itself, so the chin of the device can be removed. The iPhone 8 could debut was early as September 2017, which is absolutely thrilling. The LG G6 is another device where the front of the phone will apparently be mostly screen. LG Display’s new 18:9 ratio panel is “taller” even than the Xiaomi Mi Mix’s unusual 17:9 aspect ratio, which ensures it fills up as much of the phone’s frontage as possible. However, it still has space for Android’s menu and back buttons. More: Hands-on with the Xiaomi Mi Mix Rumors have connected the Samsung Galaxy S8 with a large, border-free screen, too. The phone might even get a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio. The Mi Mix has a similar ratio, and for comparison, the Galaxy S7 Edge has a 76 percent screen-to-body ratio. That’s the big three manufacturers all connected with rumors about the same technology, on phones that will potentially be released in 2017 or 2018, depending on Apple’s plan for the iPhone range. It’s hard not to take the rumors seriously. It’s not just these big three companies, either. Huawei has been linked with a bezel-less Mi Mix competitor for release in China, and Meizu’s Pro 7 phone may lose the bezel and include an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor under the screen — a piece of technology that’s made to facilitate bezel-less screens and rumored for inclusion on the Galaxy S8. Even the unofficial smartphone company headed up by ex-Googler Andy Rubin is supposed to be working on a phone with an edge-to-edge display. These are all rumors, certainly, but they’re pretty damn compelling ones. Do my bidding, ‘bot While the evidence may be circumstantial (for now) on the screen technology, it’s considerably more official on the artificial intelligence front. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all have their own artificially intelligent assistants, while Samsung has purchased Viv Labs (run by the creators of Siri) to help develop its own AI system. HTC’s new U Ultra and U Play phones standout because of the Sense assistant, Xiaomi is making investments in the area, and Huawei has been linked developing its own AI system. In the meantime, Huawei has partnered with Amazon to introduce Alexa to the Mate 9, something many other companies have also done. LG is using AI to power its new range of smart home robots, for use in the home and in industry, and is rumored to introduce Google’s Assistant on the G6. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Chat bots, which use AI and machine learning, simplify our online lives by reducing the amount of clicks, apps, and actions it takes to complete a task. Machine learning lets the bots understand language the more we chat away, always-listening technology brings Star Trek-like ease of use into our homes, and voice recognition means we don’t have to type a question, we can actually ask it instead. Whether it’s Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, or a legion of chatbots in Facebook Messenger; you’re probably using an AI assistant now, and they’re only going to get more plentiful (and clever) as the year goes on. It’s the beginning of the end for the traditional user interface. In the near future, intelligent assistants may guide us around our phones, and instead of prompting us to perform actions, the bots will be anticipating and doing them for us. We’re not the only ones anticipating this smart future. Huawei’s CEO Richard Yu is already planning it, and calls the next step in phone evolution the, “intelligent phone.” He sees a new type of device that’s, “an extension of who we are,” which uses complex AI, new sensors, powerful processors, and machine learning to help people understand the world around them in a new way. “As we look to the future, we’re at the threshold of an exciting new era where we’re breaking through barriers to improve the way we interact with the world,” he said at CES 2017, where he first discussed the intelligent phone idea. Phone of the near future While both borderless displays and artificially intelligent operating systems are sure to appear individually on more phones in the near future, the most desirable devices released in 2017 are likely to have both. We love the Mi Mix and the Honor Magic, but the thought of having their cutting-edge technology strengths rolled up inside a single, sexy smartphone has our hearts pounding in anticipation. We’re ready to see the first examples at Mobile World Congress at the end of February, how about you?

Quain Feb 3, 2017, 12:48 PM Best Picks Best Baby Monitor 2017 by Erik Malinowski Feb 2, 2017, 12:33 PM Round-Up 11 Ultimate Super Bowl Party Gadgets by Mike Prospero Feb 1, 2017, 2:14 PM Best Picks Best Gadgets for Home Cooks by Mike Prospero Feb 1, 2017, 12:31 PM Review Logitech Harmony Elite Review by Mike Prospero Feb 1, 2017, 11:41 AM Round-Up The Best Products That Work With Amazon Alexa by Mike Prospero Jan 31, 2017, 11:47 AM The Best IFTTT Applets Picture 1 of 23 IFTTT, which is short for If This Then That, is a free Web service that lets you create an "applet," a simple program that triggers an action if something else occurs. Following its name, IFTTT simply allows you to fill in the "If/Then" blanks. For example, "If the Atlanta Falcons score a touchdown, Then change my Philips Hue lights to red." IFTTT works with a wide range of devices and services, from Alexa and Google Home to the Nest thermostat. Connecting gadgets and services is not difficult, but it takes some patience. First, you'll have to create a free IFTTT account, as well as one  for whatever product or service you're going to be controlling, such as the Philips Hue lights. Once you do, activating an applet is as simple as a virtual toggle switch on the IFTTT app or website. Back up your tagged Facebook photos in an iOS album Picture 2 of 23 Now here's a clever way of admiring everysingle photo you've ever been tagged in by your Facebook friends (and enemies, I suppose). Turn on the applet using permissions from the social network and the ability to add photos to an iOS album. Voila! You'll never again miss another photo of you practicing your red-carpet pose, or eating massive amounts of wasabi.  Get the “bail out” phone call Picture 3 of 23 Great for internet dating and dodgy craigslist buying expeditions, this applet creates a strawman emergency situation by calling your phone at the perfect time. Just send a text to a dedicated IFTTT number with the hashtag #help and you’ll get a call to your mobile lickity-split. Now you’ll always have the excuse, “Sorry, I have to go, my dog is sick” the next time your date looks nothing like his or her profile photo. Get reminders to reach your Fitbit goals Picture 4 of 23 You wear a Fitbit for an obvious reason, right? Well, why not get a little daily "inspiration?" This applet works with any Android or iOS-enabled device, and works very simply: If you haven't reached your daily Fitbit goals by a certain time (of your choosing), you'll get a push notification politely reminding you to get moving and make your goals. Photo: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide Turn on your lights at dusk Picture 5 of 23 If you've got Philips Hue lights in your home, you can use this applet to turn on the lights in your home at sunset every day, thanks to data from Weather Underground. After configuring the applet in the IFTTT app, your lights will automatically turn on each day as the sun begins to set. Insert God-complex joke about "letting there be light" here.  Photo: Phillips Set your thermostat Picture 6 of 23 Quick temperature adjusts are just what internet-connected thermostats such as the Nest and the Ecobee were designed for. Now, you don't even need to pull out your phone to get it done. The next time you feel cold, say, "OK, Google, set thermostat to 74 degrees," and you'll be toasty in minutes. (It works with Alexa, too.) Keep in mind that this applet is set to Fahrenheit, not Celsius. Photo: Nest Find your Android phone with Google Assistant Picture 7 of 23 Misplaced your phone again? Have an Android device with the Google Assistant (aka OK Google) widget installed? Well, instead of suffering moments of terror as you retrace your steps, just say, "OK, Google, find my phone," and Google Assistant initiates a call to your phone. When you answer, you'll hear a recording say, "Hooray! You found your phone." Of course, this is only useful if your phone is on and not silenced. In which case.... Get POTUS new laws in your iOS reading list Picture 8 of 23 How times have changed. There was once a time when only people who  watched C-SPAN daily cared when the president signed a bill into law. Now, it's mandatory watercooler fodder. Why not be prepared for President Trump by having the official text of each of his new laws loaded right into your iOS reading list, thanks to ProPublica? Email your shopping list with Amazon Alexa Picture 9 of 23 Alexa's shopping list capability is a handy function—no pens, no paper, and no forgetting the aforementioned sunblock. Now, thanks to IFTTT, you can get an email of your shopping list sent to you while you drive to the grocery store. Once activating the applet in the IFTTT app, just ask Alexa, "What's on my shopping list?" and you'll get a handy list sent right to your Gmail within seconds. Get a wake-up weather call Picture 10 of 23 Talk about multitasking! It would be cool enough to get a hotel-style wakeup call every day. But how about getting a personalized wakeup call with the weather forecast for that day? Mind blown. When activating the applet, insert your name, location and wake-up time. Then, like clockwork, you'll be awakened from your slumber with the day's forecast from Weather Underground, addressed to none other than you. Send a text message to your partner when you leave work Picture 11 of 23 Geolocation apps are either the coolest thing since screen doors, or the end of privacy as we know it. Either way, this applet solves the issue of letting your honey know when you'll be home for dinner. You'll need to configure the applet in the IFTTT app with a few bits of information, including the general location of your workplace. Then, activate the applet to send a text to a specific phone number whenever you leave that location. Sure, you might get caught going out for tacos on Tuesdays with your work buddies, but it's worth not having to fumble with your headset in the car every day at quittin' time. Create iPhone reminders for starred Gmails Picture 12 of 23 Just when you thought clicking that little star next to an email in Gmail was useless, this little applet comes along and sets the universe right again. That's right, this applet automatically sends a reminder to your iPhone for every mail you star. The applet uses iOS reminders native to all iPhones to make the magic happen. See your Instagrams in full color on Twitter Picture 13 of 23 Are you tired of having your greatest Instagram photographic achievements reduced to a mere link in your Twitter feed? With this applet, all of your Instagram photos will be shared as native photos (read: full color images, no links) in your Twitter. Write the next great American novel Picture 14 of 23 Are you on the verge of crafting the next best-selling memoir, but you just can't get yourself to sit down and start writing? Use this applet to automatically open a journal entry every day at the same time in your Day One. Just pick a time, activate the applet and then all you need to do is flip open your laptop and start writing—the entry is created for you. Just make sure it's auto-saved -- you can't let this treasure get lost. Automatically create a receipt spreadsheet Picture 15 of 23 This crafty applet searches your incoming email for anything with the words “receipt” and “order” in the messages and automatically adds it to a Google spreadsheet. Certainly helpful for one-person businesses -- and those who want to track their “as-seen-on-TV” junk purchases. Create Trello cards for recurring tasks Picture 16 of 23 The title gives it away, but here are the particulars: For the millions who use Trello cards as a visual collaboration tool for work, this applet is a big help for recurring daily or weekly tasks. Just pick a day and time, activate the applet, and a Trello card for that task will be created automatically at the same time on the schedule you choose. Track your work hours in Google Drive Picture 17 of 23 This applet is particularly helpful for those of us who work freelance, or who have a side gig after-hours or on weekends. Whether you're getting paid hourly or not, it's always important to know how much time you're spending on a given project. This ingenious applet creates a button widget on the home screen of your smartphone. When you start work, click the button. When you're done, click again, and your hours will be added to a Google spreadsheet. Use NASA's latest space photos as Android wallpaper Picture 18 of 23 Anyone who's had the brilliant idea of using personal photos as their Android wallpaper knows you need really dark or monochrome photos to see your icons. Well, NASA has inadvertently solved this dilemma because  deep space is, well, dark. And beautiful. Just enable the applet through the IFTTT app and you'll get a stunning new space photo daily, automatically loaded into your wallpaper settings. Tell your lost Android phone to turn up the volume to 100 percent Picture 19 of 23 For those of us Android smartphone users who keep our ringers on vibrate, this applet is simply magic. A vibrating ringer is convenient, but becomes a problem when your phone gets lost, because calling it will do no good. This applet texts your phone a command to turn up the volume all the way so you can hear it ringing. Get an email when a craigslist post matches your search Picture 20 of 23 The benefits to this applet are endless, whether you want to be first to email about a killer apartment in New York City, or you simply don't want to create a new search every day for a Nikon D810 Camera. All that's needed is the URL from a previous craigslist search, which you then paste into the configuration page on the IFTTT app. After, you'll immediately start getting emails every time a new listing matches your search terms. Put on our sunscreen! Picture 21 of 23 Don't laugh...if all it takes is an electronic reminder to prevent a wicked sunburn (or worse), this applet will be your best friend when beach weather rolls around. Activate the applet, and whenever Weather Underground predicts a high UV forecast, you'll get a push notification on your Android or iOS-enabled mobile device. Now, if you only had an applet to remind you to buy the sunscreen. Oh, wait…. Make your own applet Picture 22 of 23 Creating applets isn't rocket science, but you'll need some patience and creativity. From IFTTT's site or app, press the button for New Applet. Next, select the "+ IF" and then choose a gadget or service. After, create the trigger that will initiate the applet. Finally, choose what will happen when you activate that trigger, from the list of available services. There are hundreds to choose from, so enjoy experimenting!

In the latter case production of such material is so professionally done that unreal casts into real. Believability is established, and its mass circulation starts rolling. By Promod Puri Education does not stop after school, college, or university studies. Rather it continues. Pursuing knowledge in the fields already studied along with new interests of learning are part of lifelong schooling. As the formal education ends in early part of life, the journey to explore and gain knowledge goes on. At the same time, knowledge itself keeps expanding.  Once the learning drive starts there is no stop on the knowledge track. However, knowledge has to be followed intelligently and with open mind. Its credibility and perception are based on truth and rationales. As our continuing education advances, it generates new studies, thoughts, theories, meanings, and interpretations. With that growth, knowledge gets enriched. We are the seekers of knowledge as well as its creator, developer, and distributor. It is at this helm that we can discern its traditional outlets, like books and libraries, newspapers and magazines, radio, and television, etc., are being outpaced and outdated by the surge in the internet and social media. And this where we alert ourselves to establish the authenticity and credibility of knowledge attained from online sources. It can prove itself to be wrong and deceptive when produced and shared thru various internet channels. The buzz word lately is the generation of fake news or information and its circulation. Google, Emails, Twitter, Facebook, and myriad of websites, etc. are the vehicles moved by our fingertips for mass distribution of news, views, and learnings along with fake stories and misinformation. In the latter case production of such material is so professionally done that unreal casts into real. Believability is established, and its mass circulation starts rolling. The production of fake news, besides posing a serious threat to bona fide information and knowledge, is a lucrative business as well. A Washington Post story last November during the height of the US presidential election reveals that crooked online entrepreneurs can make about $5000 per month by generating fake news. When a fabricated story gets viral on search engines like Google and social media like Facebook, it generates money like pouring down from a slot machine. Fake news headlines such as “FBI agent suspected in Hillary email leaks found dead…”, and “Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for President”, generated hundreds of thousands of clicks and shares, reveal the potential of this illicit business. Since the blight of fake news is going to be part of knowledge gathering, the acceptance or rejection of pseudo or genuine information depends on our sensitivity and perception, empathy or apathy. Our personal preferences also play determining role to keep us informed or misinformed while we seek knowledge. Usually, we select only that information which fits well within our interests, mindset biases, and beliefs. The production of fake or false news or information, or creation of a thought, an ideology or a campaign, and its spread covers most topics and issues from politics to religion and culture, sciences to medicines, and economics to statistics, etc. Fabricated information supporting a concept, cult, crusade of morally-revolting motives not only contaminate true knowledge but it is misleading and sinister as well. As of consequence, information literacy is corrupted. When a fake story or picture on the internet and its various outlets is released, its authenticity is seldom doubted especially by those readers who share its viewpoint. Professional “gatekeepers” like editors of newspapers or magazines, who reject, allow, or edit an incoming news story or some viewpoints in the traditional institutions, are not the norms in the receiving and delivery systems of the information technology. Our temperaments, beliefs and even our personal motives are now the “gatekeepers” in the selection and sharing of information. When these attitudes are constantly and willingly being exposed to fake information or stories, fanaticism is created, consolidated, and validated. Convictions and extreme beliefs keep the doors of truth and rationality close. DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM Despite this inevitable abuse of the system, the internet provides us a democratic platform which was till now monopolized by the traditional print and electronic media. Social media are open, free, and readily available along with profusion of websites for the dissemination of information, true or false, and viewpoint, rational or irrational. The phenomenon has led to the explosion of knowledge in its creation, presentation, and sharing. This is not anymore the domain of only professional writers, intellectuals, publishers, or editors. The Internet and online social media offer the space to express oneself in few words or in lengthy essays without editing or cuts and censorship. A submission, rejected by conventional book publishers, newspapers, or magazines editors, finds easy alternative outlets through various internet channels and online self-publishing with much wider exposure. Unlike the traditional sources of knowledge, the net in its brief history has spread itself into a vast field covered with mounds of information and knowledge. Personally speaking, I wrote “Hinduism Beyond Rituals, Customs, and Traditions” by just going thru the medium of the internet carrying wealth of relevant articles, research papers, manuscripts, scriptures, and stories. Numerous reputed and credible websites like Wikipedia are loaded with extensive knowledge to do research, study or write on any subject of interest. The internet has liberated knowledge for its easy reach and attainment. But in this endeavor, Nobel laureate George Bernard Shaw advises: “beware of false knowledge; it is more dangerous than ignorance”.

The plaintiff has also sought removal of trial court order records which mention him. NEW DELHI – There is no reason for creation of a separate legal framework under ‘right to be forgotten’ to delink ‘irrelevant information’ from the Internet, Google Inc told Delhi High Court on Thursday. The submission was made in an affidavit placed before Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva by Google which has contended that even if it disables or blocks a site in its search engine, that webpage will remain on the original website and would be accessible on other search engines. This view was also echoed by the court while hearing an NRI’s plea seeking he be “delinked” from information regarding a criminal case involving his wife in which he was not a party. He has also sought removal from the records of the trial court order which mentions him. “If you post something on social media, it will never get deleted,” the court said and added if the man’s plea was allowed then all courts may have to destroy their records in matrimonial disputes. In his petition, filed through advocates Rohit Madan and Zoheb Hussain, the NRI has claimed the online availability of the criminal case, despite it being settled amicably, affects his right to privacy and reputation apart from affecting his employment opportunities. His petition has raised the question “whether data controllers or intermediaries such as Google, are required to delete information that is inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant if they receive a request for removal of such data”. Claiming that the plea was not maintainable against it or its Indian entity, Google has said, “If a content is adjudicated to be defamatory or its goes beyond the principles of law of privacy, same can be directed to be removed pursuant to being adjudicated by the court. “However, there is no reason or justification for creation of a separate statute or legal framework under right to be forgotten.” Google has also said that the petitioner should have approached the trial court, which had passed the order, to seek confidentiality and non-reporting of the order. The company has contended that the petition is not only “misconceived” but also “legally untenable”. The court, meanwhile, asked the Centre to state its stand on whether such information can be de-linked from the Internet and listed the matter for further hearing on April 24.

PHOTO: AFP Google is reportedly killing off its stock Google Now Launcher for Android users without offering any other alternative. News outlet Android Police has obtained a memo sent out to OEM partners which mentions the discontinuation of Google Now Launcher on Play Store. Users would still be able to use some of the features such as information cards. However, the launcher won’t be available to the public starting Q1 this year. Google’s new update will let you search offline Google Now Launcher is perhaps the best option for Android users who want to get rid of unnecessary apps that are offered by smartphone-makers and get a stock Android experience. The user interface has over 50 million downloads on Play Store and seamlessly integrates Google’s very latest search features and information cards. 6 tricks for better search results on Google The move is not entirely unexpected as Google recently launched its first in-house smartphone the Pixel and so far refrained by rolling out feature available on the smartphone to other Android devices. Luckily for some there are other UI apps available on the Play Store that offer a similar stock experience such as the Nova Launcher. Furthermore, users who have the UI installed will still get updates via the Google Search app though the launcher portion itself that won’t be updated.

This is due to the release of a major update in the Android 7.0 Nougat OS just last February 3. According to tech enthusiasts, the latest version is said to be the operating system’s “most hands-on mobile software” to-date. Google teased users just last week by saying that there will be a public beta of Android 7.1.2. The newest Android Nougat update is reportedly armed with many practical improvements and enhancements. According to a review from Updato, it resulted to a way better Android experience. Features include redesigned app shortcuts, improve image and keyboard support, and more. More excited for Android O For now, the upgrade is initially only exclusive to those using Google’s own handsets. These include Pixel and Pixel XL devices, as well as older Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P handsets. Those using the Pixel C laptop also received the update. Aside from being excited for the latest upgrade, some fans are already looking forward to the next Android update. So far, the names have followed an alphabeticalized order. Because of this,  many believe that Nougat will be followed by an OS that will start with the letter “O.” Android O name suggestions iDigitalTimes reported some of the Android O name suggestions that are being discussed online. Aside from following the alphabet, past Android systems have been named after sweets. Some of these include iconic branded treats, such as Nestle KitKat back in 2013. If this trend will be repeated, then it is possible for the next OS to be named Android Oreos. Outside of a branded name, there are also speculations that it will be named Android Oatmeal Cookie. The snack’s variants – such as Oatmeal Raisin Cookie and Oatmeal Chocolate Cookie – also sound like good internal codenames for Android O. It is similar to past suggestions such as Macadamia Nut Cookie for Android M and New York Cheesecake for Android N. GOOGLE FREE TO REUSE IMAGES Non-sweets While not exactly a sweet treat, there are also people suggesting that the update should be named after Orange Julius. The frozen orange juice has been around since the 1920s. If Android developers would get nostalgic, it is possible for them to borrow the classic beverage’s name. Some are even suggesting that the green Android mascot should wear an Orange Julius uniform. There are also suggestions about how the newest release might not be named after a candy or dessert. This is due to how Google previously teased names such as Nachos and Nori for Android N. Because of this, the new OS just might be named after savory treats such as Onion Rings or Omelette.

 Analyst: Snap's 'core health is very poor' but there is a silver lining Julie Bort Feb. 3, 2017, 5:30 PM 5,836 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mike Nudelman/Business Insider Financial analysts have now had a bit of time to pore over Snap's finances and issue their opinions, since it released its IPO prospectus on Thursday. One such analyst is James Gellert, CEO of Rapid Ratings. His mission is a little different to the average analyst. Instead of Wall Street's usual buy/sell/hold-the-stock view, Gellert rates over 60,000 public and private companies to see how likely they are to default on their financial commitments, possibly even to the point of bankruptcy. Overall, Snap isn't at high risk to default. But it's not at low risk either, Gellert finds. It rated a 47-100, meaning a medium risk. The problem? Its "core health is very poor," Gellert writes in his report on the company. Snap "demonstrates weakness in earnings performance, operating profitability, net profitability and capital structure efficiency relative to the global industry set," he writes, based on analyzing Snap's finances over the last 12 months. Too much Google? In particular, Gellert says Snap's capex efficiency is in the lowest 15-th percentile compared to other companies globally. Tech Insider/Flickr/Horia Varlan That is, perhaps, to be expected. Snap is a young company growing quickly and is dependent on third-party data centers (aka cloud computing) to run its company. Last month, Snap signed a five-year, $2 billion with Google to provide cloud services that guarantees Google a payment of $400 million a year. Snap's entire revenue for 2016 was just over $404 million. Snap has always used Google's cloud and has been touted as one of the Google cloud's biggest success stories. In fact, Alphabet's venture capital arm, CapitalG, is even one of Snap's investors. However, Snap may not be so dependent on Google forever. In the fall, months before it signed this five-year deal, the company famously hired an expert in building data centers away from Amazon Web Services to lead its engineering team. Plus, it indicated in its SEC documents that it "may invest in building our own infrastructure" and that it is also "currently negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations." The company offers no real hints about who that provider might be. However, it does say that it worked with Oracle Data Cloud to study how ads that run on its apps drive in-store sales of consumer goods. It would be a huge coupe for Oracle to snare some or all of Snap away from Google. Like Twitter, except different Gellert tells us that there are eerily similarities between Snap and Twitter. Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey Larry French/Getty Images "Twitter showed a showed a similar Financial Health profile back in 2013 at the time of its IPO, but that’s not to say that Snap is in for the same kind of trouble,"he says.  "Snap has the unique opportunity to learn from Twitter’s giant missteps, and if it’s going to have success, it needs to capitalize," he says. Plus, there's no reason to believe Snap will experience Twitter's same problems. "The revolving door of management and lack of coherent product direction at Twitter killed confidence. Their part-time CEO plan is a bizarre and controversial decision. Snap needs to convey direction, a path to profitability, and grow a team that has confidence and stays with the company to then deliver results," he says. Then again, Snap has its own hurdle to overcome: it's culture of secrecy. "As a company that historically hasn’t conveyed much direction and taken pride in its secrecy, even internally, this is a new world. The public eye is sure to bring many challenges for Snap’s management team considering the public equity markets don’t like opacity,” Gellert says.

However in case you did think it was true, Google has since come forward and dismissed the rumors themselves. The rumor originated from a thread on Reddit in which an alleged email between a customer and Telus revealed that the customer’s order had been cancelled because production of the handset had been cancelled. It reads, “Google will be ceasing production of their Google Pixel line and we will not be receiving further inventory of this phone. Therefore we will not be able to fulfill your order for the selected product. We apologize on the behalf of TELUS and Google for this inconvenience.” However like we said, Google has since refuted the rumors and their statement reads, “We’re really excited by the demand for the Pixel XL in Canada. Telus is currently out of stock of the Pixel XL. We’re working with our partners to restock inventory across our retail channels and we can confirm that production of the Pixel has not stopped.” The unavailability of the Pixel from Telus was confirmed by the carrier themselves who told Android Central, “TELUS is currently out of stock of the Pixel XL. We’re working with Google to restock inventory across our retail channels as quickly as we can. Google has confirmed that production of the Pixel and the Pixel XL has not stopped. We are in the process of updating our retail channels to ensure our customers have the latest information about their Google Pixel orders.” So there you have it, if you were worried/concerned about the Pixel’s availability, know that it’s due to a lack of stock, and not cancellation of the handset’s production.

McIntyre February 2, 2017 6:55 am EST Print Email Tweet Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) brand value dropped $38 billion over the last year. Consultancy Brand Finance reported that the figure dropped from $145.9 billion in 2016 to $107.1 billion in 2017, specifically, down 27%. In the process, Apple lost its position as the world’s most valuable brand. In that regard, it was passed by Google, the search brand of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL). The Google figure rose from $88.1 billion to $109.5 billion for the two years measured. According to “Global 500 2017: The Annual Report on the World’s Most Valuable Brands”: Apple’s evangelists are beginning to lose their faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected. Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with traditional rival Samsung, but a slew of Chinese brands such as Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple’s key source of profitability. That was before Apple crushed earnings in its most recently reported quarter, which drove its shares to a one-year high: Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 first quarter ended December 31, 2016. The Company posted all-time record quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion and all-time record quarterly earnings per diluted share of $3.36. These results compare to revenue of $75.9 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.28 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 64 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “We’re thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple’s highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.” Oops.

Google Now Launcher to Be Discontinued by the End of March GO Pixel Launcher could be made available to more phones Feb 4, 2017 10:06 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google released the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones with Pixel Launcher on board last fall, but users can install the APK for the launcher on their phones. This isn’t the only launcher from the tech giant, as Google Now launcher has been featured on many Android smartphones since it was made generally available in 2014. According to a recent report by Android Police, Google intends to discontinue the Google Now Launcher and stick with just the Pixel Launcher. Google has apparently alerted GMS partners of its decision to remove the Google Now Launcher from the Play Store by the end of March. Google email revealing Google Now Launcher discontinuation Users who have Google Now Launcher installed on their phones will be able to continue using it even after the app is removed from the Play Store. Google intends to support the launcher and push out updates via the Google Search app. Pixel Launcher might be made available to more Android phones Starting March 1, Google will no longer approve new devices that use Google Now Launcher, but that won’t affect manufacturers like Motorola, who have Google Now Launcher as a default option on their devices. Smartphone makers will be able to integrate Google Now cards and any other Google services in their launchers. The move isn’t surprising considering that Google has shifted away from the Nexus line and hasn’t put much focus on Google Now Launcher lately. Most likely, Google will start making the Pixel Launcher available to non-Pixel devices, as it will gradually replace Google Now Launcher on Android smartphones. This is simply a probability, but as Google Now Launcher was exclusive to Nexus smartphones at first and then made available to other Android phones, the Pixel Launcher could take the same route. In the past year, Google has started focusing more on its proprietary apps, especially with the introduction of Allo and Duo. The two Android applications are available in the Play Store and aim at replacing Hangouts, while competing with major apps in terms of messaging and video calls.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Google#Google Now Launcher#Pixel Launcher#Nexus#Android subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google Now Launcher (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Could Soon Cease Production of Pixel/Pixel XL Smartphones Google Chrome Beta Version 57 Adds Progressive Web Apps Support Google Assistant to Make Its Way to Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X Soon Google Photos 2.8 Gets Redesigned UI and Changes to Device Folders Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One 2 photos    Google Now Launcher New Android APKs HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

However it could soon become the de facto Android launcher because in an email obtained by Android Police, Google could be discontinuing the Google Now Launcher soon. As it stands there are two launcher apps available in the Play Store today: Google Now Launcher and the Pixel Launcher, but like we said it could soon become one. According to the email, Google has informed their GMS partners of their plans to remove the Google Now Launcher from the Play Store. So what does this mean? This means that while the Google Now Launcher will continue to function, it sounds like maybe Google isn’t so interested in keeping it updated anymore. As for what this means for OEMs, Google has told them in the email that they can add the Google Now panel to whatever launcher they plan to use, which makes it almost similar to the Google Now Launcher, or build a new launcher entirely. It is unclear as to what this will mean for Nexus devices moving forward, especially since Google did not say if they were planning on opening up the Pixel Launcher to non-Android devices.

A therapist must be a blank slate, Freud said. Should analysts keep their lives offline – and is it OK if they look you up? ‘The relationship should exist between the four walls of the consulting room.’ Illustration: Leonard Beard Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Louise Chunn Saturday 4 February 2017 04.00 EST Last modified on Saturday 4 February 2017 04.10 EST Britain’s therapists have been busy over the past six months. In the weeks that followed the EU referendum, there was barely a client who didn’t kick off with Brexit. Some wanted to express feelings of disenfranchisement and anger, alongside guilt for not having done more to convince others of their opinion. Others, who had struggled with feeling excluded or rejected in the past, felt alarm bells ringing again. As one therapist blogged last summer, “External events can often trigger deep-seated feelings of anxiety” – and this was one hell of an external event. Other arguably bigger events have followed. The conversations that take place in the consulting room are critically different from the kind you might have with a neighbour, friend or relative. There are no nods, no groans, no knowing smiles; that’s not the way most therapy works. Sigmund Freud was the first to argue that a therapist needed to be a blank slate, so that a client could project their feelings on to them, a process called transference. These feelings can then be acknowledged and talked about. But Freud lived decades before the internet. Online searches and social media mean clients can now unearth myriad personal details about their therapist – not just whether he or she is married, but whether they have children, sign petitions, share photos, supported Leave or Remain. This has turned some clients into quasi-stalkers, not unreasonably: if you are expecting someone to help sort out your life, you might well want to see what they’ve made of theirs. Pam Custers, a couples therapist working in London, tells me she is scrupulous about her neutrality. Recently, she has been aware that some clients want her to drop the barriers, to talk about world politics and how it is affecting them; but she is careful about what she writes or posts online. A therapist might be divorced, or of a particular religion – such things can resonate deeply with certain people “I find myself censoring what I put out there. I would describe my approach as extremely mindful – not paranoid, I hope – about taking certain positions. So I have set my Facebook settings as high as they go, and I try to stay neutral on Twitter. But, at the same time, I do worry about having to internalise who I am in the world and how that will affect me. “It’s a real conundrum for us therapists. We want to have opinions, we do have opinions, but if we express them, some clients may take them as judgments. And I believe people do their best work when I’m a blank canvas.” Custers has a website and is trialling an online relationship-therapy programme, so she is far from a technophobe. “But I was trolled recently on Twitter, so I can see the potential problems. It’s quite a scary world out there.” Sophia Hilsely, a psychodynamically trained psychotherapist, takes a slightly different tack. According to psychoanalytic convention, she should fend off all personal queries about herself by asking why her clients are asking. “The idea is that you want to heighten anxiety, to get through to the subject.” But this is something that fewer and fewer clients are happy with. “Most people now want solutions immediately,” Hilsely says. “I will share some things with some people.” For example, she wears her wedding ring, and notes if and how clients react. Her directory profile also informs them that she has a law degree, has lived in the US and Europe, and has worked for the civil service. Many clients won’t settle for such scraps of information. Aaron Balick, a relational therapist based in London, wrote what he believes was the first-ever clinical paper on the effect of being discovered on Google, and then followed it up in 2013 with a book about social media, catchily titled The Psychodynamics Of Social Networking: Connected-up Instantaneous Culture And The Self. “We can’t predict under what conditions people will Google their therapist,” Balick tells me, “or how what they find might unconsciously affect the relationship. Hot topics are very individualised. A therapist might be divorced, or have one child, or be of a particular religion – such things can resonate deeply with certain people.” So Balick teaches therapists how to keep their professional and personal personae separate and secure. “The boundaries are more permeable now; it’s difficult not to give something away. Some are less worried about it; others are very strict. With an issue like Brexit, client and therapist can be on opposite sides of the divide, but you have to be able to talk about it. That doesn’t mean saying how you voted, but I’d say most therapists give a bit away.” It’s hard not to. In Glasgow, a female therapist who offers post-abortion counselling, and who wished to remain anonymous, tells me she has been burned by Google search. She was invited to speak about her work at a Scottish university; afterwards, a student journalist contacted her to ask if she was the person of the same name who had posted comments below a feature about abortion on the Glasgow Herald website. She asked for clarification, but the student paper ran a story linking them to her anyway. “If a client saw that article, by Googling my name, they would conclude I was judgmental about abortion – and there is nothing further from the truth. As a therapist, you want your clients to know that you are there for them and you are not going to judge them.” Even Freud fed his patients, sold them paintings, gave them dogs. He went to see the mother of one, saw one dance In a city with a history of sectarianism, she aims to be neutral. However, because she is involved in refugee work at a local school, a project that has a digital footprint, it’s easy to work out her religion and that she has children. She’d prefer greater anonymity. “It gets in the way. It puts up barriers. You learn not to respond to any of the usual signals [from clients] – Rangers, Celtic, the different schools – because you have to manage what they know about you.” Many therapists blog about mental health or current affairs to help them stand out from the pack. As Martin Pollecoff, chair of the professional therapy body, the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy, points out, some of the best-known psychotherapists in the UK, such as Susie Orbach and Stephen Grosz, write extensively about themselves and their work. “Freud’s idea of the blank screen was a cute one, but even he never did that. He fed his patients, sold them paintings, gave them dogs. He went to see the mother of one, he went to see another one dance.” Therapist Philippa Perry makes TV and radio programmes, and writes an advice column for Red magazine. She doesn’t bury her opinions or her personal life – she has 21,000 Twitter followers and is often photographed alongside her artist husband Grayson – but then, she no longer sees clients privately. “If your online presence puts potential clients off, so much the better: you probably wouldn’t get on anyway,” she says. “I’m not going to compromise who I am outside the therapy room. But inside it, I am there for whoever has signed up to work with me.” She believes that people should use technology to inform prospective clients about how therapy works, and what they personally have to offer. “In order to find a therapist, you probably need all the information you can muster. Being a blank is not my way. I’m for transparency.” How much do clients want or need to know? I spoke to a woman in her late 20s who told me she’d used Google to start her journey into therapy. “I contacted two therapists and then, based on their responses, met with the one who seemed the best fit. After that meeting, I Googled her. She has a website but she’d also written some articles about her own mental health. I didn’t want a therapist who would be preaching from on high; I wanted them to be able to relate. From what I read about her, I felt she would.” Since then, she has stayed away from Google. “To be honest, I am not sure now that it is a good idea to know too much, so I haven’t done it again, but when making those first tentative steps, it helped.” As she says, it’s the way we now approach many initial meetings, from work contacts to first dates. She has blogged about how she felt to be without her therapist over a summer break. Coincidentally, her therapist wrote about the same thing, from her own perspective. “We didn’t know that the other was doing it, and at first I did feel it was a bit bizarre, like an unsaid dialogue.” It would have been easy to read a lot, or too much, into it. “To start thinking: is she trying to say something to me? I prefer that now we meet every week, and it is what we say when we are face-to-face that is important.” If clients shouldn’t Google their therapists, a therapist shouldn’t look up a new patient, at least in theory. The idea is that they should know only what the client brings to them; anything else will muddy the water. “The relationship is what’s created between the four walls of the consulting room,” says Nigel Dawson, a therapist based in Manchester. “To be influenced by other routes is damaging – to the client and also to the effectiveness of the therapy. I might find out information they hadn’t disclosed to me, and it might affect my opinion of them.” Also, as Perry points out, it might not even be true. One therapist Googled a client who said he had a grand job, and he did. ‘It helped disentangle my disbelief’ Privately, some psychotherapists will admit that they have Googled clients. One female therapist told me about one client: “He was quite disturbed and I found some of what he told me a bit fantastical. He was paranoid, but I also thought my response to him might have been counter-transference [in other words, that she was responding emotionally to him]. He claimed to have a grand job in a big company. So I looked him up – and he did. I felt it was an excusable use of Google. It helped me disentangle my disbelief.” Another told me she might do an online search if a name seemed familiar, or if she had concerns for her safety. Technology has transformed the way therapy can be delivered: by email, phone, video, options that some clients find easier or cheaper. Most therapists I spoke to offered some online counselling, though usually only to clients they had already met “in the room”. There are myriad support groups and mental health blogs. One therapy client, who as Life In A Bind blogs about borderline personality disorder, has had 14,000 people read her most popular post, about obsessive attachments. She sends her therapist a link to her posts, “but I’m very clear that I don’t want to communicate with her in writing when I should be telling her in person. So quite often I blog about things we’ve already discussed. The real strength of it for me is the community – the feeling that I’m not alone. But sometimes, reading other blogs, means I compare my treatment with theirs. I tend to want to live out my therapy through someone else’s story, which is not good. Equally, there’s a danger in relating to another therapist whom I met online. I tend to go to him when things are not going well with my own therapy.” Her regular therapist has warned her against this. Therapy is not friendship, but the lines are just as easily blurred in the digital age. Some therapists give clients contracts that help them negotiate potentially tricky areas, such as whether they will acknowledge you if you happen upon them in the street. But what if you bump into each other on a dating site? Or find out more personal details through a friend’s Facebook connection? As Pollecoff says, “I’m 67 – my indiscretions were done in the dark. Dating is in the light these days. And you’ve got the whole James Bond life of trying to appear marvellous on Twitter and Instagram, too.” He recalls one client who spotted an ad he’d placed on a community noticeboard about wanting to buy a dinghy when he was living in Wales. “In the middle of the session, the chap says to me, ‘Are you still looking for a dinghy?’ It seemed creepy. I thought he was saying to me, ‘I know stuff about you.’” On the day I speak to Pollecoff, he is off to see a client’s exhibition, but he is clear about where the lines are drawn. “I was invited. A client often wants you there, alongside them. I’ve been asked to give away the bride, and I will do that. I’ll be at the ceremony, but not at the reception. It’s never social.” The digital age has given people access to more information and support, while eroding many of the strictures that surround a peculiarly formal relationship. Will a traditionally private practice continue to open up, in a blaze of light-filled expansion, or will the professionals be pushed into a monastic silence? For the “talking cure”, that would be ironic. • Louise Chunn is the founder of welldoing.org, an independent directory of psychotherapists and counsellors.

Six Myths About SEO Strategy That You Should Know Zuhair Sharif Digital Marketer Share More Tweet Share Save Share Stumble Email Six Myths About SEO Strategy That You Should Know Zuhair Sharif Digital Marketer | Over the past couple of years, there have been several misconceptions about how search engines operate. There have been varying conflicts about how SEO actually works. Keeping up with the latest changes in the world of SEO is a struggle. We bring you six myths that have been debunked about SEO. XML Sitemap Will Boost Your Search Rankings Can a sitemap really boost your search rankings? A sitemap truly doesn’t affect the actual rankings of your webpages. Sitemaps are like an aid that gives more information about your site to google and other search engines, making sure all of your URLs are indexed for easy crawling. When prioritized, it can lead to more visibility but that in itself is not a guarantee. Google XML sitemaps are already available for you, they just need to be installed. It doesn’t guarantee improvement for your rankings, but it helps google discover your content faster. Meta Tags Matter Meta tags are HTML tags that appear in between the opening and closing <head> tags. Since the hummingbird update, the truth is that mega tags no longer really matter. The title tag may appear in the head section of a webpage. That is actually a necessary page requirement with or without the meta description, although google may pull text from the page body as a preview snippet. Meta tags may not really boost your rankings but can make your search result attractive. Target keywords and Anchor text doesn’t matter The goal of every algorithm update is to help searchers find the sites that contain the information they need. Over optimization can get you penalized by Google. The latest update of Google Penguin made it so that contextual links have 5-10 times more ranking power than usual author profile links. Excessive keyword-rich anchor text will negatively affect your site rankings. Cross-linking with rich anchor text is equally risky so avoid it. This in no way means anchor texts have become irrelevant. It means that it pays to diversify your anchor texts. Ensure that your primary and secondary keywords are used as anchor text. An SEO Agency Can Get You Top Rankings Quickly There are diverse reasons why you may need an SEO expert. Especially for keyword analysis and competitiveness auditing. But an SEO agency cannot get you top rankings in the blink of an eye. Google handles over a hundred billion searches per month, and as such, no SEO expert or agency can readily predict new keywords. SEO is a long-term practice, and you need to put time and patience into it before you earn top rankings. If you are just starting a website, it might be a good idea to use a web design agency that really understands SEO in planning the initial architecture of the website. Guest blogging is Irrelevant Guest blogging simply means that a guest contributed content to your blog. Quality sites use guest blogging all the time. The type of article, the uniqueness of it, and anchor texts on the content can be helpful. Google can’t accurately decipher what a guest post is so a proper guest post attracts links and search results to your site. Keyword Research is Unnecessary Keyword research is critical for any SEO effort. You should avoid over optimization, excessive use of keyword rich anchor texts, and exact match domain updates. Google’s keyword planner is still the most accurate research tool out there. Keyword research is still relevant just ensure you focus on the user intent, not just the keywords themselves. There you have it. Make sure you do your research before embarking on any SEO strategy. Take advantage of the SEO tools out there that can help you achieve your objective.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software How to Update Google Pixel and Pixel XL to Android 7.1.2 NPG05E Nougat By Rafia Shaikh Jan 31, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google started releasing Android 7.1.2 Nougat NPG05E to Pixel and Pixel XL along with Pixel C and Nexus Player. If you are registered to Google’s beta program, you will receive the notification to regular over-the-air (OTA) updates of all milestone builds. Want to go the manual way? Here is how to update Pixel to Android 7.1.2 NPG05E. The steps will help you flash factory images on both Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Prerequisites to update Pixel and Pixel XL to Android 7.1.2 Beta Create a backup of all important data on your Pixel device. Download and install USB drivers for Pixel on your computer. Unlock Pixel bootloader. The Android SDK should be installed on your PC with ADB and Fastboot command working. Enable USB debugging option by pressing Menu > Settings > Applications. Navigate and tap on Developer Options to enable USB Debugging. Ensure that your Pixel phone carries more than 70% of charge. Steps to flash Android 7.1.2 NPG05E on Pixel, Pixel XL Required files: Download factory images for your Pixel or Pixel XL from the links shared below: Pixel Android 7.1.2 – Download Factory Image Pixel XL Android 7.1.2 – Download Factory Images Let’s now flash the latest beta beauty on your Google Pixel or Pixel XL. Connect your device using a USB cable and turn it off. Make sure that Fastboot is installed on your PC. Now, start the device in Fastboot mode: Turn on the phone while pressing and holding the Volume Up + Volume Down + Power keys until you see the Fastboot menu and the START text on top. Extract the downloaded Android 7.1.2 file on your PC. Go to _NPG05E_ folder and copy/paste all the files to your Fastboot directory (which often is the platform-tools folder inside the Android SDK directory). This step involves flashing the factory image to your Pixel device. Open the Fastboot folder where we just copied our Nougat factory files. In the address bar, type cmd and type the command written below and press enter. On Windows: Run flash-all.bat On Mac: Run flash-all.sh using Terminal Linux: Run flash-all.sh Once the script finishes running, your Pixel will reboot.

Your friends will think you read the whole newspaper font directup font directdown print facebook Share Warning to All Gmail Users: Update Your Version of Chrome twitter Tweet email Email Lifestyle Warning to All Gmail Users: Update Your Version of Chrome By Tyler O'Neil 2017-02-03T11:11:26 chat comments Warning to All Gmail Users: Update Your Version of Chrome On Wednesday, Google announced that its email application, the Gmail interface, will no longer work for users still on a Google Chrome Browser version 53 and below. Any Gmail users still on Windows XP and Windows Vista are likely to be affected, because the latest versions of Chrome will not work on these operating systems. Google announced this in a positive light: "Starting February 8, 2017, we will show a banner at the top of the Gmail interface for users who are still on Google Chrome Browser v53 and below to encourage upgrading to the latest version of Chrome, currently on version 55." Luckily for those on Windows XP and Windows Vista, and for those with older versions of Chrome, Gmail will still work for the rest of the year. Google warned about what would happen if users keep using Gmail on older versions of Chrome, however. "If you continue to use older versions of Chrome Browser now that support has ended, Gmail will be more vulnerable to security risks and users will not have access to new features and bugfixes," the company reported. In other words, it would wise to update, if possible. "Gmail will continue to function on Chrome Browser v53 and below through the end of the year," the company added. "Users who remain on Chrome v53 and below could be redirected to the basic HTML version of Gmail as early as Dec 2017." Google also defended its move, noting that it was announced in both "April 2015 and November 2015" that both Windows XP and Windows Vista are no longer maintained by Microsoft. In a hilariously passive-aggressive statement, the company said, "we strongly encourage you to migrate to more secure and supported systems." Granted, this is excellent advice, and Google is wise to make this move — it will help keep Gmail accounts secure, which is important after high-profile hacking events like the Podesta email hacks, for instance. Interestingly, the company added that it "does not typically announce when we discontinue support for older versions of Chrome browser because of our current supported browser policy, which states that only the most recent version of Chrome is supported." This announcement is outside the norm — Google is just trying to make sure everyone is on the same page, especially those still using Windows XP and Windows Vista.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. As part of the deal, Planet Labs will acquire the Terra Bella business including the SkySat constellation of satellites, Alphabet said. "When we thought about a company that shares Terra Bella's passion and strengths in high frequency satellite imaging, Planet was a natural home," said Jen Fitzpatrick, VP of Product and Engineering, Google. "Terra Bella has accomplished a lot in the past two years-including the design and launch of five more satellites. We're excited to see what's ahead for Terra Bella, and look forward to being a long-term customer." Google will enter into a multi-year contract to purchase Earth-imaging data from Planet Labs after the deal closes. Google had acquired Terra Bella, originally known as Skybox Imaging, for $500 million in 2014. The deal will help Planet Labs broaden its available data and add new customers. Planet Labs is one of several startups aiming to harness technology allowing satellites to become smaller and less expensive, making it easier to deploy large networks of satellites at less risk and lower cost than previously. © Thomson Reuters 2017 Tags: Terra Bella, Google, Google Satellite, Internet Reliance Jio Effect: BSNL Offers Mobile Internet Data at Rs. 36 Per GB Uber, Ola Cabs Impounded as Karnataka's Crackdown on Ride-Sharing Continues Google Sells Satellite Imaging Business Terra Bella to Planet Labs     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Zen Cinemax 4G Intex Aqua 4.0 Intex Aqua Supreme+ Intex Aqua Crystal Gionee F5 Lava 4G Connect M1 Huawei Honor 8 Lite Intex Aqua Amaze+ Asus ZenFone 3S Max ZTE Blade A2 Plus Swipe Elite Power Lava X41+ Intex Cloud Q11 4G Intex Cloud Style 4G Lava A55 Lava A50 Vivo V5 Lite Vivo V5 Plus Micromax Vdeo 3 ZTE Hawkeye Popular Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro Moto M Oppo A57 Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Nokia 6 OnePlus 3T Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones Nokia Phones Honor 6X Gadgets 360 Hindi व्हाट्सऐप की सिक्योरिटी के लिए आया अहम फ़ीचर, ऐसे करें एक्टिव दिल्ली में उबर या ओला बुक करने में हो रही है परेशानी, वजह जानें 6 जीबी रैम वाला सैमसंग गैलेक्सी सी9 प्रो प्री-ऑर्डर के लिए उपलब्ध Latest Videos 02:03 360 Daily: Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro Up for Pre-Orders, WhatsApp's New Feature, and More 02:20 Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA Review 01:35 How to Enable or Disable Two-Step Verification on WhatsApp 03:50 Art, Innovation, and Tech 03:25 5 Amazing iPhone Features Missing in Android Phones More Videos» OPINIONS ALL AUTHORS Akhil Arora How Netflix Is Losing Ground to Amazon and Hotstar in India Gopal Sathe Cloud Kitchens Take the Risk Out of Trying New Places - and the Reward Rohan Naravane UPI Has an Identity Problem That's Stopping It From Taking Off Advertisement Recent Steam Direct to Replace Steam Greenlight: Valve Facebook Testing 'Explore' Tab on Android, May Help Boost Engagement Moto G5 Plus Spotted in New Leaked Live Image Showing Metal Body Beware of These Malicious Attacks on Your Mac Devices Here Are the 12 Finalists of the Moto Mods Development Challenge BHIM App Registration Has Crossed 14 Million, Says IT Minister Chrome OS 56 Released; Brings Material Design Changes, Bug Fixes, More Scientists Discover White Dwarf Star With 'Ingredients for Life' Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 to Be Launched on March 7 Google Assistant on Pixel Can Now Control Smart Home Devices More News TRENDING Ten Years On, Is Flipkart's Culture Due for an Overhaul?

The app was primarily designed for the Google Nexus line, however, popularity skyrocketed as the launcher proved to be lightweight andswift, and offered a means to cover or hide less than desirable Android skins from competing manufacturers. According to a leaked email sent to Android Police, Google has just added an expiry date to the beloved app by removing it from the Play Store before the end of Q1 2017. Any new devices that attempt to ship with the launcher after March 1st will not be approved by Google. The search giant will allow manufactures such as Sony to tap into some of Google Now's features such as "Search Launcher Services," which allows users access to Google Now Cards by swiping right on the home screen. While many fans may be quick to assume Google is preparing to widen the availability of the Pixel Launcher, it could also be an indication that the company is knuckling down on exclusivity; a possible ploy to advocate its own hardware line. In the meantime, it appears that the Google Now Launcher will remain in the Play Store for a very short period. If you choose to download the app, don't expect any updates or improvements anytime soon.

By Agamoni Ghosh February 4, 2017 05:48 GMT The latest clarification from Google clears the air regarding the Pixel productionGetty Images Google has clarified that its Pixel and Pixel XL handset production has not been halted despite an erroneous e-mail sent out by Canadian telecom operator Telus. "We're really excited by the demand for the Pixel XL in Canada. Telus is currently out of stock of the Pixel XL. We're working with our partners to restock inventory across our retail channels and we can confirm that production of the Pixel has not stopped, " the company said in a statement. The clarification comes days after Mobileaxs, a corporate dealer of Telus products and services sent an e-mail to people who had pre-ordered the Google Pixel XL through the carrier. "Please be advised that we have received notice today that Google will be ceasing production of their Google Pixel line and we will not be receiving further inventory of this phone," the e-mail read. The e-mail which was originally posted on Reddit made its way to other social media channel sending the customers into frenzy. And, as Telus removed the Pixel XL from its site people started believing the report even more. The latest clarification from Google however, clears the air regarding the Pixel production as it is common for handsets high in demand to have low inventory. For carrier models in particular the demand is higher given most telecom giants offer such flagships on finance schemes where the customer does not need to pay the entire amount at once.

In return, Alphabet’s Google is taking a stake in the startup. Google has also agreed to purchase satellite images captured by Planet in a multiyear deal. The companies declined to share financial terms. “It’s a big deal,” said Will Marshall, Planet’s chief executive officer. “What this enables us to do is tap into new markets, like certain aspects of the financial markets, insurance and disaster relief.” With the deal, Planet will receive seven high-resolution satellites that Terra Bella currently has in orbit. Planet plans to launch an additional six of Terra Bella’s satellites. They are larger than Planet’s existing satellites and offer up to six times better imagery resolution, Marshall said. Google acquired its satellite division, then called Skybox Imaging, for $500 million in 2014. Bloomberg News first reported on the plan to sell the unit to Planet. About 60 Google employees are heading to the startup. Planet has raised more than $180 million. Marshall said Planet doesn’t need more funding to pay for the influx of staff and equipment, although the startup may raise money in the future. For its digital maps, Google currently buys from the imagery company DigitalGlobe Inc. Katie Watson, a spokeswoman for Google, said the Planet deal would not affect its deals with other imagery providers.

A search for "SEO Services" will tell you there are more than 15 million options to choose from, and it can be hard to know where to start. This post defines search engine optimization, with an emphasis on the skills, tools, and tactics that drive success. It lays out a series of questions you can ask prospective SEO companies as you go through the vetting process. The hope is that this information will help you identify candidates that best fit your needs, while minimizing your risk of disappointment or failure. What is SEO? Search engine optimization (SEO) is an ongoing process that leverages tools, techniques, and best practices to position your advertisement, web page, blog post, or business listing at or near the top of search results, where your best prospects and customers can find you. SEO is not just about keywords and rankings. It's about satisfying your business goals with creativity, empathy, outreach, and technical and analytic expertise that earns your way to the top and the trust and confidence of web searchers. Successful companies know their audience, get found on the Internet and provide exceptional value. They integrate SEO best practices into their day-to-day work either by developing those skills in-house or hiring outside help and partnering with that organization to close any gaps. What Does It Take To Win? At 30,000 feet, successful SEO depends on having: a well-architected website; sought-after, helpful and convincing content; signals that tell search engines that your website is popular and authoritative; and defending, preserving, and protecting your position and influence, once achieved. A well-architected website is one that Google can find, read and understand. It will be robust, secure, and scale as needed. Sought-after content contains the words and terms people use to search for your products and/or services, and provides them with the information they want and need. Convincing content incentivizes visitors to do what yo want them to do - fill out a contact form, make a purchase, bookmark or link to your content and share it with friends/colleagues. The most important signal search engines look for to determine a website's value is links. Links are like a vote of confidence or endorsement for your content. Other signals include time on page and site, repeat visits and page views. How SEO Works SEO is a process, and a process is simply a predefined way of doing something, one that you can repeat over and over again to produce an expected outcome. In a highly simplified example, if I hammer a nail straight down into a solid piece of wood, the head of the nail is going to end up flush with the wood an overwhelming majority of the time. It doesn't matter how many times I hammer a nail into wood, there's a better than average chance the nail head will be flush with the wood. The outcome will almost always be the same. A well-defined and executed search engine optimization process will produce a high-ranking web page an overwhelming majority of the time. The Search Process Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. In Figure 1 below, you can see a high-level illustration of the search process. At the top are people who search the Internet. They plug words into a search engine and wait for results. In the middle are the search engines. Search engines make a living by ensuring they return the best results possible when someone enters a query - they're all about ensuring searchers are happy and really don't care about who ranks on top so long as their customers (and shareholders) are happy. At the bottom is all the indexed content on the Internet. Google doesn't actually go out and search the Internet when you press the return button. Instead, they maintain an inventory - an index of all the pages on the Internet in massive databases, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to speed response times. A person enters a search term into a search engine, the search engine goes through its index to find all the web pages that contain those search terms, then it ranks them according to their perceived relevance, popularity, and authority using data derived from the underlying website architecture and proprietary ranking algorithms. The results are then fed back to the searcher who scans through them and decides what to do next. The Role of SEO in Search SEO comes between you and web searchers and search engines. It uncovers the words and phrases people use to search when they're intent on taking action, and it helps you architect a website that will be found and appreciated by your intended audience and search engines. The diagram below shows how an SEO company comes between search engines, searchers, and website owners. SEO experts understand what's important to search engines and how people search. Website owners know their industry and audience. The right partnership will ensure you and your SEO company are working toward a common goal. It will ensure search engines and your intended audience get what they need and help you earn the results you're after. Your website must be architected (designed and built) for search engines and it must satisfy the information wants and needs of your intended audience. No. That's wrong. The content on your website can't just satisfy human visitors. It must delight them. Why? Because there are probably a million other websites that can provide your visitors with the exact same information. You want your website and content to stand out and be exceptional so it can earn the signals that tell search engines that you deserve to rank on top. The Search Engine Optimization Process Business owners should seek out companies that adopt a process for optimization because it means you'll get a better return on investment. SEO companies that embrace process: employ best practices; keep up with the constantly changing market and ranking algorithms; and avoid questionable tactics that could run you into trouble down the road. Process tends to surface problems and opportunities quickly - humans don't like doing the same thing over and over again if there's a way to do it faster or to produce a better result. SEO companies that embrace process and take the time to reflect on lessons learned tend to adapt and produce more efficient and profitable results. Process helps SEO companies keep their cost structures down, their productivity up, and their outcomes superior. Ask prospective SEO companies if they have a process for optimizing websites. Ask them to tell you the last time they reviewed it and made improvements. Ask them if lessons learned are shared with everyone on the team - and if so, how. Search Engine Optimization Tools Use of the "right" tools can improve productivity and outcomes. There are six categories of paid and free search engine optimization tools that can be used to lessen the time-consuming workload of SEO, and to increase its transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness. Search engine Webmaster and Analytic tools provide feedback on a website's configuration, health, and traffic. Keyword tools help SEOs discover the words and phrases people use to search for your products and services. Competitive Analysis tools help SEOs assess the ranking ease and commerciality of keyword phrases. Editing Tools are used to create and edit web pages. Link building tools are used to discover link acquisition opportunities and to automate some the more repetitive tasks associated with that effort. Reporting tools streamline our ability to measure progress and make improvements over time. Tools matter because they allow you to do more with less - that's true no matter what you do. When it comes to SEO, small business owners should seek to do business with SEOs who leverage tools to keep their costs down and their results measurable. They should also want to work with SEOs that use tools to help ease your understanding of the process and outcomes. Ask prospective SEOs to show you examples of their work. Can you relate to the example chosen? Are results credible and easy to understand? Do you know what they did to achieve those results and how long it took? Is the company willing to let you speak with a company representative?  SEO is not easy, and it can take a long time to produce meaningful results. You have to commit and be patient, but you also need to see evidence of progress. Ask SEO companies you're considering how often they report results and what they report. You want - as a minimum - to see progress and plans each month. You don't want to see analytics showing traffic, this month vs last, as it can be misleading. Google changes the rules daily. Rankings fluctuate daily. To me, it's more meaningful (and a better use of your dollar) to see quarterly results that highlight results, not rankings. It's conversions you care about, not whether you rank first or third for a search phrase that may or may affect the bottom line. The other thing you want to know is how many websites are linking to you and where those links are coming from. Are they coming from high authority sources? A mix of high authority sources? Or are they all internal links, coming from your own website or sourced from a few, irrelevant and low authority sources that likely aren't moving the needle? These are the questions you want to be answered. Types of SEO There are different types of search engine optimization - pay-per-click, local and organic. Pay-per-click (PPC) refers to the advertised listings that appear at the top and right of search results. They usually have a small visual notation that lets you know that someone is paying to appear at the top of search results. Advertisers pay search engines a fee every time someone clicks through to view the content on their website. Local SEO refers to the tools and techniques used to position a listing for your business on local directories, maps and GPS devices. They too tend to display at the top and/or right of search results in the form of local (Carousel) or map results. Organic search results refer to everything else. They're all interrelated and interdependent. Each one helps the other. You want to work with a company that has discussed these options with you and has a depth of experience in the types that best fit your needs. Not all companies offer this. SEO Tactics Tactics used to optimize websites tend to fall into three main categories: White hat techniques comply with Google's guidelines and stand the test of time. An example of a white hat optimization technique is finding the words (keywords) people use to search for your product or service on the Web, and using those words sparingly, and in the right places, in your content. Black hat is the opposite. Google has explicitly expressed disapproval of these methods and threatens banishment or penalty if you use them. An example of a black hat technique is over-using (stuffing) or hiding keywords in your content. Grey hat is a blend of the two, a tactic that doesn't clearly fall into one camp or the other. It's not clear how search engines will react until you try it. These practices are best avoided. Business owners should steer clear of SEO companies that toy with gray and/or black hat optimization techniques because you risk getting caught and bumped down in search rankings or being banned altogether. Ask prospective SEO companies if they follow Google guidelines. Ask how they keep track of and decide what to do with rule changes. Do they share changing rules with their clients? If so, when and how? Does that work for you? SEO Best Practices Best practices are the techniques that have become a defacto standard. They consistently deliver results that are superior to those produced by alternative methods and have become commonplace, accepted and expected.  In the SEO industry, there are generally agreed-upon best practices for: domains; URLs (Uniform Resource Locator or the unique address of a Web page); content (also referred to as on-page SEO and copywriting); meta tags (descriptive data about the page itself, for example, the page topic, focus, and description); and internal and external links. Moz is a respected leader in the SEO world and a good source for best practices. A Google search for Moz and "best practice" is an easy way to find their suggestions. We offer our own best practices for SEO copywriting. Ours are written specifically for small business owners, whereas Moz targets an audience of SEO professionals. The two complement one another. Moz offers a 10-minute video presentation of how best to acquire links in 2016. Backlinko goes into more detail and offers some creative solutions in their definitive guide to link building. Business owners should ask prospective SEO companies about their best practices, which ones they use and why. You should ask if those are baked into their SEO process and shared, along with lessons learned, with the entire team on a regular basis. Best practices are of no use if they're not shared and used. Asking these questions will give you a sense of how cohesive, mainstream and industry-compliant the company is, which will help you identify whether their efforts are likely to produce positive results or put you at risk. Web Pages A web page is a unit of content (page, blog post, image, video) that can be uniquely referenced and viewed on the World Wide Web using a browser such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Mozilla Firefox and others. From a search engine optimization (SEO) perspective, it's important to know that web pages are optimized, not websites. Web pages are what appear in search results. Your web page must contain the words people are searching for (or close equivalent) before you'll even be considered eligible to rank in search results. Target Audience The target audience of any SEO effort should always be the business owner's prospects and customers: not search engines; not "anybody"; but a very narrow, specific and defined categorization of people who are in the market to shop for and purchase your goods and/or your services. Your other target audience should consist of your peers and competitors. Google considers the recognition of your peers and competitors when deciding who to rank on top. If industry-recognized websites link to content you have created, it will boost your page and site authority. High authority content ranks well on Google. A sound understanding of your audience is imperative for good SEO. Remember SEO is not just about ranking. It's about conversions. The more information you can share about your best prospects and customers with the team or person providing your SEO, the greater the likelihood that you'll be able to convince searchers to click through to your site and to take action that benefits your business. Ask prospective SEO companies to tell you the type of information they will want to gather at your first meeting. If they express no interest in trying to understand your unique value proposition, goals, and customers, they may not have an appropriate focus. Ask them to tell you how they will ensure your website attracts the "right" audience. Ask them how they decide which keywords to recommend. Use answers to these questions to gauge their business savvy. The more they understand your business and market, the better results you'll achieve. SEO is a Misnomer My last note relates to the term "search engine optimization". Search engine optimization or SEO is a misnomer - the process does not, in any way, optimize search engines. Search engines operate independently of SEOs and SEOs have no influence over them. Our understanding of how things work comes from public statements made by the search engine companies themselves, and from expert SEOs who spend their time researching patents, analyzing search results, and experimenting to understand cause and effect. There is no magic. There are no secrets. It's just plain effort and skill, on our part as well as yours. Business owners should seek out companies who have a strong business orientation and value partnerships, efficiency and quality in order to earn the best return on investment. How To Vet an SEO Company SEO is not just about keywords and rankings. It's about satisfying your business goals with creativity, empathy, outreach, and technical and analytic expertise that earns your way to the top and the trust and confidence of web searchers. Successful companies know their audience, get found on the Internet and provide exceptional value. They integrate SEO best practices into their day-to-day work, either by developing those skills in-house or hiring outside help and partnering with that organization to close any gaps. Companies that achieve online success build and maintain websites that are architected for search engines and their well-defined audience. They continuously populate their website with sought-after, relevant, fresh, unique, specific, engaging, and valuable content which earns the signals search engines use to determine your ranking worthiness. Successful companies keep up with and evolve with market and search engine demands. They are continuously learning, follow industry and search engine best practices, and avoid gray and black hat tactics that put your company at risk. They follow a process, leverage tools to keep their costs down and measure results that impact the bottom line. Google offers additional tips and suggestions for how to vet an SEO company about half way down their what is SEO page. SEO Industry thought leader and tool maker Moz does too in this "How Do I Find a Good SEO" video.

As explained by Google: “Now when you’re searching on the Google app for a particular recipe, you’ll see a carousel of tappable suggestions to make sure you catch the best recipe to suit your taste buds and kitchen skills.” Look familiar at all? That’s because it’s almost exactly the same as Pinterest’s ‘Guided Search’. Pinterest launched Guided Search back in 2014, and they’ve been refining it ever since. The development of Guided Search has lead to Pinterest now facilitating more than two billion searches every month – in fact, just this week Pinterest announced new search ads to capitalize on this rising interest. Google clearly has some concerns about losing search traffic – which makes sense, two billion searches on another platform are two billion less its facilitating. Combine that with search activity on other platforms (Facebook sees more than 1.5 billion searches a day) and it’s no surprise that Google would be looking at ways to innovate in line with audience trends. The announcement underlines the growing relevance of social as a search and discovery tool, and an innovator in the online space. Like with Instagram copying Snapchat Stories, the platforms are starting to become more aligned, as dictated by user response - if there’s a function that works and another platform can adapt it, they will. The risk is that we lose differentiation and innovation, but the leading platforms know that they do need both of these elements to progress. It just might be that someone else comes up with them first, effectively doing the R and D work on their behalf. Google’s new ‘Recipe Search’ is available now in the Google app. Author Information Andrew Hutchinson Writer/Moderator @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

Apple's fall in the Brand Finance Global 500 ranking after five years at the top comes as the study claims its brand value dropped 27% to $107.1bn over 2016, while Google's rose by 24% to $109.5bn. Lego has replaced Disney as the most powerful brand in the world, according to the ranking. The report said Google remained "largely unchallenged" in its core search business, with its advertising revenues up 20% in 2016. Brand Finance chief executive David Haigh said: "Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. "New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand." Lego's success followed licensing deals with Star Wars, Harry Potter and the Batman franchise, which would also reinforce the company's brand strength among both children and adults "for years to come", the report said. Meanwhile, Visa and MasterCard's brand value grew by 81% and 58% respectively in 2016 as their core markets continued to move towards a cashless society, Brand Finance said. Coca-Cola and Pepsi both fell in the ranking, by 13 and 12 places respectively, as scrutiny around the marketing of sugary drinks to children gained pace. Fast food outlets McDonald's, KFC and Domino's Pizza continued to drop down the ranking, with their brand value falling by 9%, 27% and 16% respectively. The Global 500 five most valuable brands are: :: 1. Google :: 2. Apple :: 3. Amazon.com :: 4. AT&T :: 5. Microsoft The top five most powerful brands are: :: 1. Lego :: 2. Google :: 3. Nike :: 4.

The launcher, however, will still be functional, but don’t expect major updates moving forward.  ( Google ) Advertisement Ever since 2014, Google has offered users to install its own Google Now-based launcher on any Android device, but that option may soon revoke. According to reports, Google is planning to remove the Google Now Launcher from the Play Store not later than Q1 2017. It will also stop approving new Android devices that'll ship with the said launcher beginning March 1. Google Now Launcher To Be Pulled Soon The report was culled from an email forwarded to Android Police. In it Google says that because its Search Launcher Services library is a more scalable solution, it decided to do away with the Google Now Launcher. Google's proprietary launcher was designed primarily for its Nexus line of devices, although many users with non-stock Android phones had the option to download it, presumably to cover up unpleasant and hyper-customized Android skins slapped on by third-party phone manufacturers. The Google Now launcher is by contrast clean, smooth, streamlined, very organized, and fitted with a consistent Material Design flair all throughout. Google Now Launcher Will Still Be Supported (Kinda) While the email clearly states that Google is about to pull the Now Launcher off the Play Store before Q1 2017 ends, it also states that support for existing users will continue via updates to the Google Search app. With the pseudo-demise of the Now Launcher, it's possible that Google is redirecting its focus on expanding the new Pixel launcher, although it's currently exclusive to the company's self-branded flagships, the Pixel and Pixel XL. When Google finally kills off the Now Launcher however, users would have to relent with their default Android skin or download a different one from the Play Store, like the Nova Launcher or the Zero launcher. There's practically a trove of them available. Will Google Release Its Pixel Launcher To Other Devices? Could this mean that the Pixel launcher will soon open up to other devices? The notion seems unlikely for now, as it's actually one of the incentives customers get with Pixel handsets. Don't hold your breath for a wide Pixel launcher release any time soon, but if Google's Now Launcher was able to land on other devices in the past, it's certainly a possibility that the newer Pixel launcher will have the same fate. But Google seems stingier about what features it's willing to share with other phone manufacturers, given that it's trying to provide plenty of incentives for users who pick up either a Pixel or a Pixel XL. That's not to say, however, that it will totally close off broad access to the Pixel launcher, but as it stands, the prospect seems unlikely. Anyhow, the email also states that the Search Launcher Services library for OEMS that's been in testing is now finally available. That's the one Sony used to integrate the Google Now panel into its custom Android launcher in the past. That essentially means that OEMs can overlay the Google Now panel on whatever launcher they choose. The Google Now Launcher currently has 50 million downloads on the Play Store.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google Now launcher for Android will reportedly be discontinued soon Soon you will not be able to get the pure Android look on your phone as Google is tipped to kill the Google Now Launcher. According to an email obtained by Android Police, from the Android team at Google Mobile Services (GMS), “Google Now Launcher will be unpublished from Google Play” in the first quarter of 2017. The email further adds that Google still plans to support anyone who has already installed it on their phone or tablet with updates to the Google search app. Google plans to remove Google Now Launcher from the optional GMS package on March 1st. This essentially means GMS partners will no longer be able to offer new devices with Google Now Launcher after March 1, 2017. Introduced in 2014, the Google Now Launcher allowed Android users to access Google’s information cards, Google Maps, weather and more importantly added the ability to access Google Now directly from the home screen. It has clocked more than 50 million downloads on the Play Store. As Google is planning to bid bidding goodbye to Google Now Launcher, there is a possibility that the company will make the Pixel launcher (which is currently exclusive to Pixel devices) available for other Android phones.

It’s impossible. It’s an integral part of our childhood, and continues to be so for children today. Heck, forget children, as an adult, LEGO can help manage your time better How To Use LEGOs To Manage Your Time Better How To Use LEGOs To Manage Your Time Better I think I've found the ultimate productivity tool: LEGOs. Don't leave! Let me explain. Read More . LEGO holds a special place in the hearts of all geeks. Give a geek a LEGO box set right now and he or she will immediately want to put it together. Naturally, when so many geeks are so in love with an object, the internet has more than a handful of brilliant websites dedicated to it. So we went hunting for a little bit of fun, a little bit of utility, and a little bit of pure entertainment. Let’s put some bricks together. 1. Let’s Build It Again (Web): Find Instructions for Old Sets LEGO box sets always came with a set of instructions on how to put it all together. But over the years, you might have lost those instruction manuals. Heck, you might have even picked up second-hand unboxed LEGO brick sets without any instructions. Let’s Build It Again helps you put it back together. The site has collected over 1,500 LEGO instructional sets, dating back to 1958. You can directly search for the manual, or try and find it through the “theme” and “set” categories. The latter might be a better way to get a manual for something whose name you don’t know. If you need a manual, you’ll find it here. Go, check your old LEGO sets and get building again! 2. Rebrickable (Web): Find Things to Build With What You Have Unless you have been the most organized child and then adult in history, you should have a bunch of box sets that are missing some bricks. So yeah, you probably can’t make whatever the box picture says. But you can still get quite creative! Rebrickable lets you add up to three box sets and shows what you can make by combining pieces from all three. While the box set way is cool, it’s the MOC (My Own Creations) which I really like. You might not always remember the original boxes, but MOCs are great for inspiration. See something you like? You’ll find which parts were needed to make it and how to make it, with detailed instructions. Rebrickable is an active community of LEGO enthusiasts, so you will invariably find someone or something to geek out. It’s a great way to rediscover your love for LEGO 8 Sites to Rediscover Your Love of Lego & Build up Your Collection 8 Sites to Rediscover Your Love of Lego & Build up Your Collection If that old LEGO box is gathering dust in the attic, it's time to bring it out. The playset is enjoying a resurgence. But eight sites say that it never went away. Read More . 3. Mecabricks (Web): Build LEGO on Your Screen A couple of years ago, Google and LEGO came together to launch the amazing Build with Chrome project Google Announces New LEGO Project: Build With Chrome Google Announces New LEGO Project: Build With Chrome Ever wanted to build something out of LEGOs but avoid the danger of stepping on one of those foot-destroyers? Well, the Chrome team and LEGO Group have a treat for you: Build With Chrome. Read More , where you can build LEGO houses anywhere on the globe. Mecabricks is a much better version of it, and with better pieces. The app works completely in the browser, and doesn’t require you to install any proprietary software or plugins. A large variety of bricks and pieces await you, with a seemingly endless platform. Change their colors, change their texture, and do anything else you want. It’s a bit like LEGO meets Photoshop. I’d recommend reading the starter’s guide, which has useful tips and advice on how to use Mecabricks correctly. Start with a house, one of the simpler LEGO constructs, and then move on to complex figures. 4. Brick Street View (Web): Google Maps in LEGO! Everyone loves Google Maps and its Street View feature Take Virtual Walks in Google Maps Using Street View Player Take Virtual Walks in Google Maps Using Street View Player Google's Street View is great for getting a sense for a location, but you can get an even better sense by using Street View Player. Read More . It’s a special feeling to sit at your screen, look at a map, and then zoom in to a ground-level view of everything. Brick Street View takes this fantastic innovation and renders the view as if it were LEGO land. You can go anywhere in the world, just like you would with Maps. Search for a place or pan-and-scan to it. Grab the little LEGO figure’s hand to jump down to street view. The only issue is that you can’t move around while in Street View. It takes a few minutes of Brick Street View to render the street scenes in LEGO bricks, so moving around won’t be possible. But it’s still pretty cool to see LEGO trees and cop cars instead of the real deal. 5. Legoizer (Web): Turn Images Into LEGO Murals Handmade gifts are always better than buying something. Legoizer might be the greatest way to build a gift for a geek. It turns images into LEGO murals. Upload an image to Legoizer and it will turn that image into a LEGO structure. The best part is it also tells you exactly how many bricks you will need of which color and size. Buy the right ones from a site like Bricklink or LEGO’s official store and start building it. Do You Still LEGO? When was the last time you played with LEGO? Do you still enjoy laying those bricks together and making some cool structures? Have you found creative uses like organizing technology with LEGO 6 Ways Lego Can Organize Your Technology 6 Ways Lego Can Organize Your Technology In 1932, a small toy company in Billund, Denmark launched a line of plastic bricks which could be interconnected in order to build structures and shapes. It was called Lego. Read More ?

It says “Cast Device Not Connected” and is a notification that cannot be removed. Here we will explain what’s causing this and how to get rid of it. Advertisement The problem is Facebook. More specifically, this persistent notification pops up after watching a video on the Facebook Android app. A combination of things makes this happen but we can get rid of it with just a few steps. Thousands of users on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit have reported the problem. Google is also aware of the situation. Trying to swipe it away or hitting the play or X button to close it do nothing. So what’s going on? Read on to learn how to get rid of this pesky irritating notification. Facebook will soon be releasing an update that will enable full Google Chromecast support. Meaning users can cast video from Facebook to their TV with any Chromecast device or Android TV. This is a feature that is coming soon, or was just released and appears to be broken. We’re not completely sure. Combine that with Google just updating Google Cast to Google Home, and the two aren’t playing well together. Luckily there’s an easy way to get rid of the above notification. Temporarily, and for good. Whether you know what Chromecast is or not, here’s how to fix the problem. Advertisement On November 1st Facebook released an update on the Google Play Store for Android users, which appears to have fixed this problem. If you’re still experiencing this, go update your apps on the Play Store. Or download the latest version here. Clear “Cast Device Not Connected” Notification Tap on the notification popup and Facebook will open Disable Facebook popups by unchecking Allow Notifications Alternatively long-press the popup and then choose to Force Stop Facebook Users who are experiencing this can simply press the popup (or long press) and choose to turn off notifications for Facebook. This removes the problem, but now you won’t receive any notifications from the social network. That isn’t ideal for most, so continue reading for other ideas. A temporary fix is to head into Settings > Applications > Default or Manage Applications > then scroll down to Facebook. Once you find it, click the app and tap “Force Close” as shown above. Or Force Stop. This forces the app to close and kills the persistent notification millions are experiencing. However, the next time you watch a video on Facebook it will come back. Advertisement Another option is to go to Settings > Notifications > and scroll down to Home. It’s a house-shaped icon in multiple colors. Disable that. Those who haven’t updated the app will need to search for Google Cast, and disable notifications for that application. For now this seems to be the best route, unless you’ve installed the latest Facebook app update. Another method is to install the Facebook Beta for Android, or a third party app completely. Like Swipe for Facebook, which is a far better app than the official one from Facebook themselves. Are you still experiencing this problem? Let us know in the comment section below. 4 Responses 11/01/2016 docooper Reply Samsung Galaxy S7, Android 6.01, press left tab button, then close all tabs. On the home screen press the active apps widget and close all apps. Notification goes away. Much easy process for a temp fix. 11/02/2016 Cory Gunther Reply Clearing all running apps doesn’t fix it on my Galaxy S7 Edge. I don’t have an active apps widget either. Only in recent apps button by the fingerprint scanner. None of those fix it. Interesting. Anyone experiencing this on something other than Android? 11/03/2016 Jesse Kona Reply Disabling notifications for Facebook fixed my Samsung Galaxy Tab S. Thank you! 02/03/2017 curious Reply “Another option is to go to Settings > Notifications > and scroll down to Home. It’s a house-shaped icon in multiple colors. Disable that.
