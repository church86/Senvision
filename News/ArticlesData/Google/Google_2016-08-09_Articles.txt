Amanda Schiavo Aug 10, 2016 11:52 AM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- It has been a year since technology giant Google rebranded itself and became Alphabet.  (GOOGL) Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin made the decision to re-brand the company in an attempt to separate its search engine business from its other tech initiatives such as cars and virtual reality. Shares of Alphabet are just coming off of fresh 52-week highs, CNBC anchor Jon Fortt reported on "Squawk Alley" on Wednesday morning. Fortt and anchor Kayla Tausche discussed Alphabet's first year. "From a core Google perspective, absolutely they've done fantastically well. Investors have gotten a clearer look into the profitability of the business," Fortt said. Looking beyond the Google segment there are a few things that haven't happened in terms of what people were expecting a year ago, such as a split and spinoff of YouTube. One thing that has come to pass is the discipline that Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat continued to talk about, Tausche said. The anchor called discipline a "buzzword" that was reoccurring throughout the quarters on the company's earnings calls. "She just did a bond deal last week to help the company mature its capital structure," Tausche added. "Unless, do you think that expenses have gone down dramatically, they really haven't. [Alphabet] is just spending them differently." Alphabet's M&A initiatives haven't slowed down, in the last 12 months it spent about $1.8 billion in about 20 deals between the two entities. Pointing out that the last year hasn't "been all sunshine and roses" Fortt noted that Alphabet's cloud direction is still unclear, calling the structure under Diane Green "odd."

Alphabet’s birth was announced in a blog post by Google co-founder Larry Page on 10 August 2015. The missive makes clear that financial clarity drove the decision to restructure. Nevertheless, Page also wanted people to get “super excited” and for the entity to stand for something new. The markets have since rewarded Alphabet for clarity about how much money Google’s search activity was making against how much the pre-revenue moonshots were burning through: it briefly became the world’s most valuable company. But a year in is a good moment to ask what it has achieved vis a vis these other two objectives. An indicative answer is provided by The FutureBrand Index, an annual exercise where thousands of people worldwide rate the world’s 100 largest listed companies across 18 attributes. The companies are then ranked according to how positively each is perceived. Alphabet had inherited Google’s listing but we threw in Google for good measure, to compare impressions. As an early verdict on Alphabet in brand strategy terms, the results are not encouraging. Whereas Google had topped the Index in previous years and would have done so again in 2016, Alphabet sank to position 21. Apple now moved up to occupy the first position, leading Alphabet even more emphatically in perception than in valuation terms. Further, people are projecting what they know of Google onto Alphabet because the perception profiles of both entities are very similar, ie they are both relatively stronger in the same attributes. However, what is particularly worrying is that Alphabet comes 25th in terms of the innovation attribute in isolation, when innovation is the very thing the restructure was designed to foster. In sum, it appears that people simultaneously struggle to distinguish Alphabet from its predecessor and are not as excited by it. This matters. Research by Weber Shandwick concluded that corporate brand is as important as product brand when it comes to purchase decisions. Buyers, whether businesses or consumers, take account of the reputations of parent companies. Further, our own research has demonstrated a correlation between positive perceptions and stock market out-performance over time. These factors, along with the need to be employers of choice, is why there has been so much effort on the part of ‘house of brands’ corporations such as P&G and Unilever to seek the advantages accruing to strong ‘master brand’ companies such as IBM, Nike and Apple. An enhanced profile resting on a clearly defined purpose that unites its otherwise disparate brands can be the right approach to position a parent company and its subsidiaries for future success. In fact, Google was well placed to pursue the master brand strategy, having accrued enormously positive associations and with several sister companies already sharing the Google name (eg Google X and Google Ideas, now ‘X’ and ‘Jigsaw’ respectively). But its founders opted instead for a new vehicle: a parent that stays out of the limelight to let its subsidiary brands shine. At the same time they willed it to be an enthusiasm-inducing and eminently investable proposition, only in the absence of a public interface and with no discernible push to shape perceptions. Looking ahead, any halo effect Alphabet enjoys as Google’s new incarnation will likely further wane. Moreover, allowing the view to persist that Alphabet is Google by another name surely runs counter to the founders’ intentions. That is why in entering year two it would serve Alphabet well to weave a compelling narrative beyond the financial one, that connects its burgeoning family of companies. A narrowly focused Google, shorn of cutting-edge activities, must for its part guard against becoming perceived as a mundane internet advertising company. The new name and company structure has created challenges when such a move is typically designed to resolve them, because of negative associations with a sector for example (think Philip Morris being reinvented as Altria). Google had no such problems in 2015 so we must wait to see if the move becomes a masterstroke or an unforced error. Because of the early uncertainty however, Alphabet only scores a B for its brand strategy.

But one group contributes way more than you'd think. WSJ's Christopher Mims reports. Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal. February 27th 2015 2 years ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ The Android version of Google Maps has been updated. Matthew Dunnnews.com.au@mattydunn11 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend GOOGLE Maps has unveiled its latest update for Android and it comes with three massive additions to the popular navigation app. Among the changes are a battery and data saving Wi-Fi Only mode, the ability to save maps offline on a memory card and changes for travellers to Asia and Europe. The Wi-Fi Only mode limits the app to offline files when connected to 3G or 4G, which is a blessing for those using Google Maps abroad. Even when you are outside of an area downloaded and saved to your device, Google’s feature promises to never use any of your mobile data. This means the maps will only update to include any missing sections when connected to a Wi-Fi network. The inclusion of the feature has seen Google removing the Offline Areas mode, which would stop using pre-loaded maps as soon as it got a mobile signal. It is hoped this will help ensure users aren’t chewing through data unknowingly. Speaking of the addition on its blog, Google said the new mode could also save battery life. “When you know you’ll have spotty service or just want to save on data, you can toggle to ‘Wi-Fi only’ to use Google Maps entirely offline on Android,” it wrote. “The best part is that you can still use other apps and the rest of your phone as you normally would. You might even save on battery life too.” Setting up the feature is as simple as this.Source:Supplied The other major change to the Android version of the app is the ability to save maps offline. “Entry-level smartphones come with internal storage capacities as low as 4GB, while higher-end models range between 8GB and 32GB,” it wrote. “For many of us, that’s not enough for all the videos, music, apps, and photos we cram onto our beloved smartphones. “To ensure that Google Maps users with any storage capacity can download and use offline areas when they need them most, we’ve added the ability to download your offline areas to an external SD card.” Google said the downloading maps to a microSD card will dramatically improve navigating in areas without good mobile coverage. The navigation app will also allow users to choose between internal and external storage before a map is saved for offline viewing. Users can choose if they save the map to their SD card or smartphone.Source:Supplied The final update improves Google Maps integration with taxi apps in several countries across Europe and Asia. This feature builds on the March update, which introduced a dedicated mode to easily compare ride service options without having to open multiple apps. Do you like these additions?

In the filing, Google is seeking permission to test the wireless broadband service in 24 US locations, including Chicago, Boulder, Las Vegas, Austin, and Raleigh. Google has been testing the wireless Fiber technology in Kansas City, but the FCC filing indicates that Google is preparing to roll the service out to more cities across the country. The filing was spotted first by Business Insider. Currently, in areas that have Google Fiber, Google uses high bandwidth fiber optic cable to connect homes to the service. But that plan requires a lot of time and money, and a wireless service, which would combine fiber cable with wireless technology, could prove more cost effective and get Fiber internet into homes quicker. Google's acquisition of wireless internet startup Webpass is helping the company expand the service, according to Bloomberg. Related How the Merchandise Mart Became the Epicenter of Chicago Tech Google says its looking to test the service for a period of two years. It's unclear when the testing would begin, but Google said in the FCC filing that it would initially test in Atwater, California, Mountain View, California, Palo Alto, California, San Bruno, California, San Francisco, California, San Jose, California, Boulder, Colorado, Kansas City, Kansas, Omaha, Nebraska, Raleigh, North Carolina, Provo, Utah, and Reston, Virginia. Google announced last year that it had Chicago on its short list of potential Fiber cities, writing in a blog post that it was "inviting Chicago and Los Angeles to explore bringing Google Fiber to their cities." "In Chicago, fiber Internet will help bolster a fast-growing startup scene by fueling incubators like 1871, venture capital funds like Chicago Ventures and hundreds of small businesses," Google wrote in the blog post. "With the help of the city’s leadership, Internet speeds can help attract more tech talent and add to the 40,000 tech jobs that exist across the Windy City."

Google’s installation of 1Gbps fiber-optic internet service in several Silicon Valley cities has been put on hold while the company considers infrastructure alternatives, according to The Mercury News and Ars Technica. San Jose, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, and Palo Alto were and still are on the list for superspeedy internet access, according to city officials and Google. The cities were recently surprised to learn the schedules have been pushed back.  Mike Fuller, Mountain View public works director, said, “We didn’t expect it because we were working on what was their plan at the time.” Related: Are you on the list? Google Fiber is going to these cities next In San Jose, final permits that were ready in May marked the expected launch of a three-year construction project. Estimates were that 60 percent of the fiber-optic cable would be underground and 40 percent aerial, on utility poles. Almost 100 employees set to install Google Fiber in San Jose last month were informed of the delay and offered transfers to work on an unrelated project in San Diego. According to fiber-optic installer Salvador Bustamonte, “They said that Google was going to re-evaluate this whole project because they were thinking of going aerial.” Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. is in the process of buying point-to-point wireless data company Webpass, Inc. That deal is expected to be done by the end of summer. Because Webpass’s technology offers internet service at the same gigabyte speed as Google Fiber, once the acquisition is complete, Google will have three choices: cables laid underground, cables strung pole-to-pole,and point-to-point wireless. Digging up city streets to run cable underground is time-consuming and costly. According to The Mercury News, AT&T and Comcast have been making it difficult for Google to use existing, privately owned utility poles. If point-to-point wireless can provide service as fast as fiber-optic cable, the Webpass acquisition could keep Google out of the ground and off the poles, and into the air. Google Fiber spokesperson Veronica Navarrete confirmed the company is still talking with the Silicon Valley cities but said it “takes time” to deploy “the latest technologies in alignment with our product road map while understanding local considerations and challenges.” From the national perspective, The Mercury News reported, “Google Fiber is already up and running in seven other major cities, outside California, but a source familiar with the project says the company is putting additional fiber locations on the back burner to reassess the technology and explore a cheaper alternative — wireless service that does not require expensive, capital-intensive, and time-consuming installation of fiber cables under the ground. The source said Google is now focusing more on aerial installation.” For cities on the Google Fiber lists — in California and other states — delays in gigabyte internet have to be frustrating. If, however, it turns out that new technologies or combinations thereof enable faster and less expensive gigabyte internet rollouts, many more cities could benefit.

The search giant's broadband subsidiary has told officials in Palo Alto and Mountain View, the site of Google's headquarters, that fiber rollouts have been delayed, according to a report from the San Jose Mercury News. Google has also told workers in San Jose that its project is on hold while it looks into "going aerial," according to the same report. Intriguingly, the report comes just a few weeks after Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) announced plans to buy a San Francisco-based company called Webpass, which uses "point-to-point" fixed wireless technology to support gigabit-speed broadband services. (See Google Fiber Buys Webpass in Wireless Play.) Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet Inc. , has also indicated that fixed wireless technology could play a major role in Google Fiber Inc. 's business. "There appear to be wireless solutions that are point to point that are inexpensive now because of the improvements in semiconductors; that these point to point solutions are cheaper than digging up your garden and can carry the gigabit performance," he said during a meeting of Alphabet shareholders in June. (See Alphabet Wants to Network the Nation's Cities.) Google is not the only broadband player in North America that has shown interest in using wireless technologies instead of digging up streets to lay fiber, often at considerable expense. As noted in a recent blog by Heavy Reading senior analyst Gabriel Brown, the first applications of 5G mmWave technology are targeting fixed access, with both AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Verizon Wireless -- the two biggest telcos in the US -- announcing plans for field trials this year. (See The Return of Fixed Wireless Access.) This is not the first time that fixed wireless has attracted interest. Several years ago, technologies including LMDS (local multipoint distribution service) and fixed WiMax were grabbing headlines, but neither of those has lasted the distance. Brown thinks this time could be different, noting that wireless technologies have improved as costs have fallen. The rollout of gigabit broadband access networks is spreading. Find out what's happening where in our dedicated Gigabit Cities content channel here on Light Reading. The involvement of Google and other technology giants in this area could obviously help to bring costs down even more. Through its Telecom Infra Project, Google rival Facebook has been developing new wireless technologies as part of its overarching goal of bringing Internet services to underserved communities and improving the economics of Internet access. Facebook's Terragraph system, for instance, uses unlicensed spectrum in the 60GHz band to provide high-speed connectivity in densely populated areas. During Light Reading's Big Communications Event in Austin in May, Hans-Juergen Schmidtke, the director of engineering for Facebook's Infrastructure Foundation team, told attendees that Facebook is targeting a cost point for Terragraph that is "significantly" less than that of rival connectivity solutions. (See Facebook Lauds Terragraph Cost Savings.) Interestingly, Facebook has previously revealed plans to conduct trials of Terragraph in the downtown part of San Jose, which means the city might soon become a testbed for a number of new wireless technologies. Using more conventional fixed-line infrastructure, Google Fiber has now advanced into the cities of Atlanta, Austin, Kansas City, Provo and Nashville. While its progress has been relatively slow, market observers believe the company's main objective is not to become a major service provider in its own right but to spur investment in gigabit-speed networks that will support more advanced Internet services.  Iain Morris, , News Editor, Light Reading (8)  |  Comment  |  Print  |  RSS Comments Newest First  |  Oldest First  |  Threaded View        ADD A COMMENT [close this box] Login 50% 50% DanJones, User Rank: Blogger 8/22/2016 | 12:53:31 PM Re: Long Time Coming We Will see...

Getting to the ideas that "these point to point solutions are cheaper than digging up your garden," is probably a too simplistic look at this point even though in some cases that's going to be true, but not everywhere and for every use.

I've seen too many reports trying to suggest this somehow means that Google Fiber has hit a "snag" or is suddenly overwhelmed by the high cost of fiber deployment. Webpass is a supplemental point to point solution, and Google Fiber has long eyed a variety of different experimental wireless solutions to help complement existing fiber builds.  Reply  |  Post Message  |  Messages List  |  Start a Board Login 50% 50% DanJones, User Rank: Blogger 8/10/2016 | 4:26:02 PM Re: Long Time Coming They continue to chip away at a hybrid/HetNet approach.

Using Rumsfeldian logic, fiber is a known known. Fixed broadband wireless is an unknown known (the unknown part being exactly how it can scale, and then there's the whole landscape/geography issue). Yes, fiber is more expensive to deploy (and probably maintain) than wireless, but there's also the opportunity cost of waiting for broadband wireless to catch up (if it ever can). Hybrid is a hedge, which is why it looks like the preferable option.

McKinsey & Company says women experience pipeline leakage at three primary points: being unable to enter, being stuck in the middle or being locked out of the top. Each pipeline pain point presents its own challenges, but also opportunities to stop the leak. Wireless operator Sprint is making a conscious effort to improve its own pipeline from new recruits to the C-suite, and it wants the rest of the industry to do the same. In this Women in Comms radio show, WiC Board Member and Sprint Vice President of Enterprise Sales Nelly Pitocco will give us her take on the industry's pipeline challenges. Pitocco, who joined Sprint in May and has spent 20 years in the comms industry, will also offer solutions, share how Sprint is tackling the challenge within its own organization and take your questions live on air.

Facebook Twitter Google RSS Cloud Mobile Social Big Data Bleeding Edge Columns Get McAfee’d Dr. Bitcoin smartworld Future Data City of Paradigm Masthead Send Us a News Tip Select Page Google Fiber delays San Jose rollout while it considers the switch to wireless by Eric David | Aug 9, 2016 | 0 comments It has been more than a year since Alphabet Inc’s ultra high-speed internet service, Google Fiber, announced that it would be coming to the area around San Jose, California, but despite getting approval from the city to begin construction, it seems that the company’s plan may have hit a snag. According to the San Jose Mercury News, Alphabet has told Palo Alto and Mountain View that it will be pushing back Fiber’s rollout while it considers cheaper options, and those options may include switching to aerial service rather than traditional landlines. Alphabet’s move seems to have come as a shock to local officials who had been involved in the project. “It was a surprise,” Mountain View public works director Mike Fuller told the San Jose Mercury News. “We didn’t expect it because we were working on what was their plan at the time.” Google Fiber has been slowly rolling out to more cities across the United States, with six cities already supported and possibly dozens more in the pipeline, but the company has run into trouble along the way, including intense resistance from traditional internet service providers (ISPs) like AT&T. Earlier this year, AT&T filed a lawsuit to fight a new ordinance in Louisville, Kentucky, that would have made it easier for Google to use existing utility poles to build infrastructure for Fiber. This may be one reason why Google is look to avoid the poles entirely by moving to wireless service. Alphabet has already brought Fiber one step closer to this reality with its recent acquisition of San Francisco-based ISP Webpass Inc. Webpass uses point-to-point wireless technology that is capable of speeds comparable with Fiber, but with a much lower cost for infrastructure. Earlier this year, Alphabet CEO Eric Schmidt also talked about the company’s own experiments with point-to-point wireless internet, saying that it would be “cheaper than digging up your garden” to install. RELATED:  What you missed in Big Data: AI continues to gain momentum “The best way to predict the future is to invent it,” Schmidt said at the time. “We start from that premise here at Alphabet.” Image courtesy of Alphabet Inc About Latest Posts Eric David Eric David is a staff writer for SiliconANGLE, covering the latest trends in social media and gaming.

They slipped $1.59 to close at $24.01. A dismal July, which saw sales fall by 4 percent, put a halt to the turnaround that the San Francisco retailer had reported in June. Banana Republic had the worst showing, with a 14 percent decline, Gap stores saw a 4 percent drop, and Old Navy sales were flat. High-speed delay Google has told Mountain View and Palo Alto that it is putting plans to provide lightning-fast fiber Internet service on hold while it explores a cheaper alternative, Bay Area News Group reported. And nearly 100 employees hired to install Google Fiber in San Jose were told that project was being delayed, according to workers. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, recently acquired Webpass, and is expected to adopt its technology, which involves sending aerial data between transmitters on top of buildings, avoiding digging up city streets. Want to save money? Move away What’s the worst place to live in the U.S. if you want to save money? Oh, come on, take a wild guess. Yes, San Francisco indeed topped a list put together by Go BankingRates and published by Business Insider. Oakland was third and San Jose 13th (it didn’t rank higher only because average workers earned so much). Of the 15 cities on the list, only New York and Miami were outside California.

 Google is expanding its tests on the way to blanketing the US in super-fast wireless internet Jillian D'Onfro Aug. 10, 2016, 6:55 PM 17,872 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google A new filing with the Federal Communications Commission reveals how seriously Google is focusing on its plans for a wireless version of Fiber, its high-speed internet service. The company has been testing a new wireless-transmission technology using the 3.5-GHz band in Kansas City, but the heavily redacted FCC filing suggests that it wants to dramatically expand to testing "experimental transmitters" at up to 24 US locations, including Provo, Utah, Omaha, Nebraska, and Boulder, Colorado, for a period of 24 months. Google is requesting authorization to operate between the 3.4 and 3.8 GHz band. "We are working to test the viability of a wireless network that relies on newly available spectrum," a spokesperson tells Business Insider. "The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant Internet access to consumers." Google Fiber's original plan to spread super-fast internet across the US involved running high-bandwidth fiber-optic cable directly to each home that its network would serve. That process has so far proved to be expensive and slow-moving. Since it announced the acquisition of point-to-point wireless-internet company Webpass earlier this summer, the Fiber team has started turning more of its attention to a using a new approach that will pair existing fiber with its own wireless technology. The company has even delayed its Fiber rollout plans in two Silicon Valley cities as it looks for cheaper, wireless alternatives, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Although several of the cities that Google wants to test are already Fiber cities, the tests will be non-commercial for now. All of the end-user devices used for testing will be in the hands of Google employees, contractors, and "'trusted testers' selected by Google on a volunteer basis without payment."

More than 300 technology leaders, innovators, policymakers, journalists and academics will gather Friday at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion Club to share their ideas on closing the gender and diversity gap in the technology sector. Speaking at the Advancing Women in Tech Conference will be BuzzFeed and Huffington Post founder Jonah Peretti, head of Uber Labs Charlene Wu, Mayor Eric Garcetti’s tech advisor Jeanne Holm and senior executives from Google, Box, Sony, Cisco, NBC Entertainment, Warner Bros., Atom Factory, the U.S. Economic Development Agency and the Los Angeles Business Journal, among many others. Also speaking will be Dean Jayathi Murthy, who became the first woman to lead UCLA’s Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science last January. “I’m looking forward to participating in the conversation as I think we’re approaching a turning point in the long-term issue of increasing the number of women working in the technology sector,” Murthy said in a statement. “The next steps are critical if we want to see improvements.” This second annual conference is hosted by the UCLA Office of Information Technology under the UCLA Women in Tech initiative. Dean Murthy answered a few questions from conference organizers Davida Johnson and Stefanie Pietkiewicz about her personal connection to the issue and how UCLA Engineering is striving to ensure diversity in its program. What was your own personal motivation for choosing engineering as a major in college and as a career? ​My father is a civil engineer, and I saw as a child how much good he was able to do in the world. He graduated from engineering school soon after India obtained independence and spent the early part of his career building roads and bridges in some of the most remote and poor places in India. I saw how much of a difference that made, and how much respect he was held in. My admiration for my father translated into an admiration for engineering. Of course, I also loved the idea of doing something that girls didn't normally do — breaking rules always had a big appeal for me. When I started going to engineering school myself, I found it fun and rewarding, and so a career in the field was natural. Have you experienced any challenges as a female engineer?  ​Yes, of course. I was among the first handful of female engineers to graduate from IIT Kanpur in India, and there were natural​ly big challenges to do with that — people hadn't really thought through what it meant to admit young women into an all-male institution.  And if you are first at age 15, you're first at age 50. So I've been first pretty much every step of the way. That means figuring out how to achieve your goals your own way, because there aren't too many people around who have experienced what you are encountering. What advice would you give to female students who want to pursue a successful career in tech, given the lack of female representation in technology companies? ​Tech and engineering are terrific careers — that's why we're trying to increase the number of women in UCLA Engineering. An engineering career is creative, fun, lucrative and, ultimately, deeply important to society. So it is worth the fight. ​And things are getting better, though too slowly for some of us.  How is UCLA Engineering striving to ensure diversity in its program? Do you think we are making progress? ​Our statistics are roughly on par with the other top public engineering schools, but none of us are nearly good enough. For example, last year 23 percent of UCLA engineering undergraduates were women, which is okay, but we are going to do much better. One of the things we are going to kick off is a Women in Engineering program to focus on significantly increasing the number of women across the board — in our undergraduate and graduate programs and among our faculty. We have improved our numbers over the last decade, but I hope to change the rate of increase. ​There are varying opinions on how to address the gender gap in technology. What strategies have you seen, experienced or executed that work best?  ​I've taken a pretty focused approach. At my old job, as department chair of mechanical engineering at University of Texas, Austin, I kicked off a program called 35-in-5, an explicit program to get to 35% women in the incoming class in five years. This meant looking hard at freshman admissions, understanding which high schools our female students came from, working on converting admits to acceptances, using our network of alumni, among other strategies. We were quite successful, going up some 6 percentage points in two to three years. And we worked hard on retention by embedding women students in research groups to give them a community to work in, among other things.   ​At UCLA, I hope to work across the entire pipeline, from admissions to retention to graduation and, ultimately, persistence and success in employment. I hope to form an ecosystem of female engineers in Southern California connected to UCLA who can help each other. We are just now thinking through this program, and you'll be hearing about it soon. What do you hope this upcoming conference will achieve? ​I hope we come to a better understanding of the drivers that bring women to engineering and those that drive them away. And from this, I hope we can formulate successful strategies to significantly move our numbers.​ Find out more about the conference and how you can attend.

Register Now Advertise Google Stifles Growth For Yelp Internationally by Laurie Sullivan, Staff Writer @lauriesullivan, August 10, 2016, 12:45 PM Recommend (5) During Yelp's Q2 2016 earnings call Tuesday, Charles Baker, CFO at Yelp, called out some international challenges. "We're trying to unlock additional distribution," he said. The company's executives feel encouraged by the 20% growth for the quarter in the U.S., but challenged by the slow international growth. Yelp management has talked "pretty openly about how Google made our life a little bit more difficult," starting a couple of years ago. The company has seen "real change" when it comes to international traffic growth, Baker said, but it's not good enough. "We have some focused efforts there to try and unlock more," he said. Baker was referring to how Google’s search ranking algorithm changes in late May 2014 impacted Yelp's slow growth internationally.  It's not clear whether Google continues to negatively impact traffic to Yelp, but growth from unique visitors fell 1% year-over-year in the quarter, compared with a sequential 2.5% rise, which Raymond James Analyst Aaron Kessler attributes largely to weaker desktop traffic.   Analyst consider Google search changes a "price catalyst," which mean an event that causes the price of the stock to move. Tom White, analyst at Macquarie Securities, rates "Google search changes" right up there with the company's earnings results and product innovation, according to a research note published Wednesday. During the earnings call, Yelp said that to drive broader awareness, the company's testing and measuring TV, online video advertising, and direct marketing before it makes a "sizable investment," according to Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder and CEO. He said that during the second quarter tests began to show lifts in more than a dozen different metrics. Another priority for 2016 is Yelp's core local advertising business. The company has been investing in business owner tools in sales and account teams. The results from these efforts during the last year has generated more than $500 million in local revenue and grew the company's base of local advertising accounts by 32%. Stoppelman gave examples of domestic growth, but none internationally. In the U.S., the Regal Entertainment Group, one of the largest cinema operators in the U.S. began advertising on Yelp last year. He said the cinema group has experienced "dramatic" increases in Web site traffic and high converting leads, but offered no hard numbers. 22 SHARES Tags: google, hyper local, local media, local search, search Recommend (5) Print RSS All content published by MediaPost is determined by our editors 100% in the interest of our readers ... independent of advertising, sponsorships or other considerations.

With the current offline mode you need to first download an area to be able to use it when there’s no connection, but as soon as your phone gets a signal it will switch back to using data. Now, however, you can tell Google Maps to only use Wi-Fi data without having to turn off mobile data system wide, so other apps can continue to use you carrier’s Internet connection. The new feature should be useful in publicly connected areas and will otherwise rely on previously downloaded mapping data. That said, Google does note that it might still use a small amount of cellular data, presumably to check on traffic data or other important updates. You can turn on WiFi-only mode from the Settings menu. To save maps to your device, you can go to “Offline areas” in the app’s menu, and then hit the plus button to add a new area. In addition to WiFi-only mode, Google has also complemented its offline capabilities in Maps with the ability to save maps to an external SD card. The feature is pretty self explanatory, to use it go to settings in the “Offline areas” submenu, and select “Storage preferences.” You can download the new version of Google Maps right here.

In September Google will release Chrome 53, which will be designed to block Flash. Most Flash on the web today is never even seen, as Google points out 90% of it is loaded behind the scenes. However, this type of Flash can slow down your web browsing experience, which is the reason behind Google’s decision to block it. In Google’s words: HTML5 is much lighter and faster, and publishers are switching over to speed up page loading and save you more battery life. You’ll see an improvement in responsiveness and efficiency for many sites. ADVERTISEMENT Google began to de-emphasize Flash last September, when Flash content started being served on a click-to-play basis, rather than autoplaying in the browser. Following the positive effect of that change, Google appears to be all but removing Flash from its browser completely. The company even announced a future update coming this December where HTML5 will become the default experience on Chrome. Sites that only support Flash will still be accessible in Chrome, but users will first be prompted to enable it. What was once synonymous with in-browser gaming, entertainment, and cutting edge web design, Adobe Flash has been outshone by competing technologies which are lighter, faster, and easier on your device’s battery life. The two companies will continue to work together, with Adobe said to be assisting Google with its efforts to transition the web to HTML5.

The Gaza Strip and the West Bank are defined with a dashed border — the mark Google uses to outline disputed territories. (Photo: Via Web)  PALESTINE.jpg Google Maps shows only an outline of Palestine and does not label it. The Gaza Strip and the West Bank are defined with a dashed border — the mark Google uses to outline disputed territories. (Photo: Via Web) Amid accusations that Google deleted Palestine from Google Maps, the Internet giant said that Palestine never was labelled by Google in the first place. There had been a row after a glitch caused the West Bank and Gaza to briefly disappear from Google Maps. Google Maps shows an outline of Palestine but with no label. Instead, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is defined with a dashed border — the mark Google uses to outline disputed territories. While 136 members of the UN recognise Palestine as an independent state, the US and much of the West does not. After a forum of Palestinian journalists released a statement condemning Google, there was outrage on the Internet as people started venting their anger using the hashtag #PalestineIsHere. A Google spokeswoman said: “There has never been a 'Palestine' label on Google Maps, however, we discovered a bug that removed the labels for 'West Bank' and 'Gaza Strip'. We're working quickly to bring these labels back to the area." A petition from March this year urging Google to include Palestine on their maps now has almost 250,000 signatures, according to the Guardian. This has raised questions about how mapping technologies affect people's understanding of the world.

The project is the result of an ongoing collaboration between Google and the local Grupo Cultural AfroReggae organization. Two years later, streets and 10,000-plus local businesses in 26 favelas now appear on Google Maps, thanks to ‘Tá no Mapa,’ our ‘On the Map‘ project. The collection includes 360° panoramas with Street View technology, some 3,000 images from photo archives and art exhibits, virtual reality tours with Google Cardboard and videos showcasing a new generation of Cariocas making their mark in the city’s cultural landscape. From iconic monuments and spectacular views, to the history of Guanabara Bay and the majestic Theatro Municipal, these online exhibits capture Rio from every angle. By leveraging its current capabilities and partnering with on-the-ground organizations, Google has provided people the ability to better establish themselves in their countries and build a better life through something as simple as an address. An estimated 85 percent of those that live in a favela have mobile phones with internet capability. Establishing an official location to a home enables businesses to grow, further expand tourism (whether of the positive or negative kind), as well as aid local law enforcement in their efforts to further combat the crime the areas are infamous for.

(Reuters/Morris Mac Matzen) Share Written by Mike Murphy August 10, 2016 One year old, but one year wiser? On Aug. 10, 2015, Google announced that it was folding itself into a new parent company, which it was calling Alphabet. A year later, it’s not entirely clear what’s really changed. While CEO Larry Page didn’t make it entirely clear why the name was chosen (although perhaps it was because there was a Google property for every letter of the alphabet), investors were excited by the prospect of the corporate restructuring. It allowed Google to focus on the things it knows how to do well and make money on—search, advertising, Chrome, YouTube, the Android operating system—and shifted more pie-in-the-sky projects, like trying to cure death, build robots, and beam the internet from weather balloons, into a new division called “Other Bets.” At first, it seemed like the move would help Alphabet keep key people like Sundar Pichai (by being able to promote him to CEO of Google), complete big acquisitions more easily, and report with more transparency on its various projects. While Pichai has indeed taken the helm and done a solid job of growing Google’s core business in the last year, Alphabet has not bought any massive companies, nor has it provided much more detail on the inner workings of its other projects. In reality, all we now know is that “Other Bets” is a massive money pit that hasn’t shown any signs of producing new businesses that could rival Google’s advertising business in terms of size or revenue. Google is still growing—its revenue last quarter was $21.3 billion, up 21% from a year earlier—but similar signs of life have not been seen in Other Bets. In the last four quarters, it’s lost over $3.7 billion, and only generated roughly $500 million in revenue, which works out to less than 1% of Alphabet’s quarterly sales. Alphabet’s Other Bets includes things like Google Fiber, the company’s initiative to bring high-speed fiber-optic broadband to the US; Boston Dynamics, a research firm working on humanoid and dog-shaped robots for the military; and Nest, the internet-of-things company Google bought in 2014 that makes smart thermostats and other as-of-yet unnecessary gadgets. In the last year, Nest’s CEO Tony Fadell has left Alphabet amid claims that he was creating a “toxic” work atmosphere, and Boston Dynamics is apparently being shopped around for a buyer as Alphabet struggles to monetize its work. Last year, The New York Times said Google was restructuring to “keep its lead as an innovator.” It’s certainly still very early in Alphabet’s life, but so far it’s been hard to see a future for the company that isn’t still dominated by Google’s advertising business. But as the company celebrates its first birthday, Wall Street doesn’t yet seem particularly concerned with Alphabet’s current lopsidedness—the company’s share price is currently flirting with its all-time high, hitting roughly $808 in after-hours trading at the time of publishing.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author 9-Point Technical SEO Checklist for Developers Dropped in the Rankings? Diagnose, Minimize & Reverse the Damage Google Algorithms Explained, Pt. 2: Provide Better Answers If you’ve been doing search engine optimization for any serious amount of time, you’ve probably undertaken a link building campaign. In an effort to build a quality backlink profile, many SEOs focus almost exclusively on earning new inbound links. However, there’s an effective way to achieve some quick wins and top up that all important link juice; through link reclamation. What is link reclamation? It’s the process of finding and fixing broken links pointing to your site, or replacing links that aren’t passing value as efficiently as they could. They could be links on your own site to internal pages or external links other people are using on their sites. Link reclamation is a great opportunity. Not only do you get to take full advantage of links that already exist or are in your control, but you can also avoid building new links, which can be very difficult. Leaky Internal Links When reclaiming links, start with your own internal linking. You have control over these links, making them the lowest of the low-hanging fruit. Use a web crawler like Screaming Frog or DeepCrawl to identify where you’ve got broken or dead internal links. If you’re using the Screaming Frog SEO Spider, filter your crawl results by Client Error to find pages returning 404 codes. Click on URLs, and then Inlinks in the bottom pane, to find all your internal links pointing to that page. If you’ve got a large site with a lot of pages and links, do a Bulk Export and then sort or filter the Excel file by status code. While it’s possible to fix broken internal links via 301 redirects, it’s not necessarily the best way. You’re better off fixing the page or link to make sure you’re preserving vital link juice. Note: You’ve probably heard that you should also consider reclaiming links that send users to a 302 redirect, because they don’t pass link juice. This is no longer the case: Google will treat a 302 redirect like a 301 when it comes to passing link equity. Leaky Backlinks Broken links Finding and fixing broken backlinks is a bit more complicated than fixing your internal ones. The main reason is that you don’t really have any control over them. You’ll also have to know some slightly advanced Excel functions, depending on how many pages and links you have. Use a tool such as Majestic or Ahrefs to find sites that link to any pages that you may have moved or deleted. Export your backlinks into an Excel file and sort the list by importance — the name of this metric depends on what tool you’re using. Copy the list of URLs over into another Excel file and save it. Find the broken links by crawling the target URLs to Screaming Frog’s list mode. Filter the results by Client Error (4XX). No URLs showing? Congrats, you’re done. Otherwise, you’ve got some work to do. Export your list of 404 error URLs back into Excel and paste the URLs and status code into your list of backlinks provided by your backlink tool (you could also paste them into a new sheet – depending on personal preference). Use the VLOOKUP function to map the URLs to the status code. Now, just sort or filter your list by status code and you’ll be able to find all your broken backlinks. You can add a couple of columns for ‘date email sent’ and ‘date link fixed’ for tracking purposes. Since some SEOs like to use multiple data sources, you can go through the same process using Crawl Error data downloaded from Google Search Console. If you’ve got a large site, this will take a bit more time because you will be dealing with a list of every broken URL, not just those that have been linked to. Now that you have your list of broken backlinks, the link reclamation process at this stage is ideally as simple as sending the linking site owner a short email with the updated URL. When you do this, point out that updating a broken link improves the site’s user experience and SEO, making it a win-win situation for all involved. You should see a high conversion rate for these emails. Site canonicalization issues Canonicalization and duplicate content is another way pages and sites lose out on link juice without really knowing. Common causes of canonical issues are: Not implementing a www resolve Camel casing (www.examplepage.com vs. www.ExamplePage.com) Trailing slashes Pages available as both HTTP and HTTPS If you don’t resolve these URL issues, you’ll see your incoming link juice diluted between all the different variations. To find instances where this might be occurring, do a site crawl with Screaming Frog or use Google Search Console HTML Improvements to find duplicate title tags and meta descriptions. Check to see if there are variations of the same URL. Fixing this problem could be as easy as deploying 301 redirects on your non-canonical URL variations, ie: pointing users to URLs in all lowercase, or URLs that include a trailing slash. As mentioned earlier, 301s will pass on the full value of the link, consolidating your equity on a single URL. Unfortunately, 301 redirects are not always a possibility due to CMS limitations or a lack of access to web development resources. When this is the case, use the rel=”canonical tag”. This bit of HTML tells search engine crawlers that the current page is really just a copy of your primary canonical URL. This tag has the benefit of passing on indexing properties, like link juice, and trust to your canonical page. Put a canonical tag in the <head> of each page with a variation of your canonical URL. If you decide your canonical URL uses https, all lowercase letters and a trailing slash, your rel=”canonical” tag should look like this: <link rel="canonical” href=”(https://www.example.com/)”>
 Give Google and Bing stronger hints to your canonical URL by setting a preferred URL in Google Search Console. This gives you the option to decide if you want Google to see your site with or without www. at the beginning. This feature also tells Googlebot how to follow links it finds while crawling the web. If someone links to your site as example.com, Google will treat that as a link to www.example.com and act accordingly. They’ll also take this domain preference into account when displaying your URL in search results. However, human users will still be able to access your non-preferred URL, so set up a 301 redirect to send users and other web crawlers to your preferred domain. Unlinked Mentions Even after you’ve fixed your broken internal and external links, you still haven’t captured all of your missed opportunities. There’s a good chance that somewhere out there someone has mentioned your site, brand or company and, for whatever reason, didn’t drop a link. This isn’t technically reclaiming lost links because you’re going after links that don’t exist yet, but it’s still an easier process than your average link building outreach. The first thing to do is to monitor your brand using Google Alerts. Use your company, product and/or brand names as keywords in your Google Alerts to learn whenever someone is talking about you online. Not only will you find opportunities when someone hasn’t linked to you, you’ll also be able to check out new links and fix any that use broken or out of date URLs. Make sure you’ve set up alerts using specific keywords — if you cast too wide a net you’ll end up blowing up your own inbox with notifications. Convincing webmasters to drop links to your site shouldn’t be too difficult since it’s good for their users (which is good for them) — everyone wins! You can also track mentions for non-branded proprietary aspects of your business, like content that you’ve created, logos or slogans. You can use Google Alerts to find where people use your proprietary content in text. Use Google Images to do a reverse image search to find where people have used your graphics or photos without attribution. This feature is quick and easy to use, but surprisingly few people know about it. On the Google Images page, click the camera icon in the search bar. You can then search by your image’s URL or upload your image from your computer to find pages that are using your image. Unless they are actively trying to steal your content, most people will readily add a link as an attribution when asked. To Wrap It Up Link building is one of the most important parts of off-page SEO. It’s also one of the hardest when you’re trying to build new links. That’s why it’s so important to make sure you’re always getting the most out of the links you’ve already earned. Before beginning any link building campaign, go through a link reclamation process to nab some easy link juice and get the ball rolling. How has reclaiming links impacted on your SEO?

(Photo: Joel Salcido, USA TODAY) SAN FRANCISCO — Google Fiber plans to test wireless broadband technology in a bid to bring super-speedy Internet to more places faster. The division of Google parent Alphabet wants to test the technology in as many as 24 locations over the next 24 months, according to a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, spotted byBusiness Insider. If approved, the testing could advance Fiber's mission to build out a nationwide broadband network by tapping a new band of spectrum. "We are working to test the viability of a wireless network that relies on newly available spectrum," Google said in an emailed statement. "The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant Internet access to consumers." USA TODAY Google Fiber no longer a moonshot — it's a 'real business' Earlier this year Fiber won approval to use antennas mounted on light poles and other structures to deliver wireless service in Kansas City. Fiber, a division of Google parent Alphabet, is striving to bring Internet speeds of one gigabit per second to cities around the country, but progress has been slow. Fiber delayed its rollout plans in two Silicon Valley cities to incorporate wireless alternatives, according to the San Jose Mercury News. USA TODAY Google gets 'serious' about beaming wireless broadband into homes Wireless technology has emerged as an alternative to digging up streets and stringing fiber cable on utility poles. Fiber recently said it would buy Webpass, which delivers its services to homes and businesses  by sending data between transmitters installed on top of buildings. Fiber is looking at a combination of Webpass, its own wireless technology and leases of existing fiber and municipal broadband networks to accelerate its expansion to supplement its efforts to deliver fiber-optic cable to each home and business it serves. 70 CONNECTTWEET 31 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2b4LAte

SUBSCRIBE Confirmed: New AdWords interface rolling out to more users Google has confirmed the rollout of the new user interface to more AdWords users. Greg Finn on August 10, 2016 at 3:15 pm More In March of this year, Google announced a sweeping change to the interface of AdWords, a product that hadn’t had a significant facelift in quite some time. Yesterday, a few AdWords users were surprised to see the new UI showing when they hopped into their accounts. Today, Google has confirmed that the interface is rolling out to more AdWords users. Yatin Mulay of Zen Online Marketing logged on to see the above new tab-less interface (with data redacted). He went on to state that some features were hard to find in the new interface and that it was a “radical” change. In regard to the new interface surfacing, a Google Representative has confirmed that the interface is rolling out to more users. Previously, Google has stated: Through 2016 and into 2017, we’ll continue to build out this new AdWords experience, and invite advertisers along the way to try it out and provide feedback. Invites will be sent based on a number of factors, therefore not all advertisers will be able to test the new experience right away. It should be noted that this move is purely an interface design change — it will not change the core functionality of AdWords. In fact, in a phone interview with Search Engine Land back in March, Paul Feng, AdWords product management director, had stated that the change will help advertisers reach across the spectrum of  search, display, shopping, mobile and video.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Nexus Sailfish sighted on AnTuTu benchmark By R Padla - August 10, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If not catching Pokemon, some people in the Android community are busy trying to catch “fish”. We’re talking about the next Nexus phones HTC is believed to be working on for Google. The Nexus Marlin and Nexus Sailfish have been regulars at the rumor mill lately. For now, let’s focus on the smaller model. The Sailfish was recently spotted on AnTuTu with some specs listed by the benchmark site. We no longer doubt that HTC will be manufacturing the new Nexus phones because the Taiwanese giant has a good working relationship with Google. We’re hopeful that this partnership will help HTC get better numbers. The ailing company is in dire need of a hand and Google is in the best position to do so. HTC has an edge now since the two new Nexus phones are believed to be manufactured by the OEM. There’s no other brand the Android execs partnered with or this year’s Nexus duo–only HTC. Turning up in the benchmarks are the following details: some Android NMR1 will be powered by a Qualcomm 820 chipset, Adreno 530 GPU, unknown screen size, 1920 x 1080 resolution, 8MP front-facing camera, 13MP rear camera, 32GB internal storage, and 4GB RAM. Screen size could be 5-inches based on a previous leak while battery could be 2770 mAh. The HTC Sailfish should also have a Bluetooth 4.2, USB-C port, fingerprint scanner, and bottom-firing speaker according to earlier leaks. The Nexus is expected to arrive with the bigger HTC Marlin. Let’s wait and see for more leaks and teasers before the official launch hopefully in October.

Google Maps Hackers hijack Google Palestine site with anti-Israel message Gazans 'liberate Palestine' in new computer game Who is Ruth Porat, Google's new CFO Palestinian journalists protested at the weekend that Google removed the Palestine tag from its maps application. But the web giant says it never had a Palestine tag on its maps to begin with. The journalists saw the removal of the name Palestine as a part of an Israeli plan to dismiss the existence of a Palestinian entity.  A campaign was mounted on Twitter under the #PalestineIsHere hashtag. “The Forum of Palestinian Journalists condemns the crime carried out by Google in deleting the name of Palestine, and calls for Google to rescind its decision and apologize to the Palestinian people,” reads part of the statement from the Forum of Palestinian Journalists, posted to its website August 3. “… The move is designed to falsify history, geography as well as the Palestinian people’s right to their homeland, and [is] a failed attempt to tamper with the memory of Palestinians and Arabs as well as the world.” The Washington Post reports though that Google hasn't changed its labeling of the region and that the search results are the same now as five months ago, where the word Palestine does not appear on a map including West Bank and Gaza territory. Google says the complaints against them are baseless. "We have never had a 'Palestine' label on Google maps," the company told The Washington Post. But the company says it has found a bug that has deleted the tern West Bank and Gaza Strip which it is working to restore. The Post's columnist Caitlin Dewey feels though the Palestinian protest "does raise some interesting questions about the power of mapping technologies like Google’s. "In their attempts to dispassionately document the physical world online, tech companies often end up shaping our understanding of it, too," Dewey writes.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Internet Google Chrome will start blocking all Flash content next month Google Chrome will start blocking all Flash content next month By Ryan Whitwam on August 10, 2016 at 2:30 pm Comment Flash was an integral part of the internet in years past, but it has also been a drag on performance and the source of a great many security vulnerabilities. Today, HTML5 is a better way to get the same sort of interactive content running on the web, and it works on mobile devices. The next phase in Adobe Flash’s agonizingly slow demise starts next month when Google Chrome begins blocking all Flash content. This will come as part of the Chrome 53 update, which should be available in early September. Chrome 53 will block all the small, non-visible Flash elements on web pages. These are usually tacking platforms and page analytics, but they can slow down page loads just like larger Flash content. This is not Google’s first attempt to de-emphasize Flash on the web. Last year in Chrome 52, Google made most Flash content “click-to-play.” So, what’s different now? In Chrome 52, the Flash block only applied to Flash objects that were above a certain size, but now that’s being extended to smaller Flash objects. The previous restriction was in place because at the time, there was no reliable way to detect viewability. Now, Chrome’s intersection observer API allows that. You will have the option to enable Flash objects on a page if they are necessary for the experience. If non-visible Flash objects are blocked, an icon in the address bar will alert you. Google says that all Chrome users will see a benefit from this move. All the Flash objects loading in the background can make page loading sluggish. If you’re on a laptop, Flash also gobbles up power and reduces your battery life. Flash’s innate inefficiency is why it never took off on mobile devices. While Flash content will be blocked in general, Google is making a temporary exception for some popular sites that still rely heavily upon Flash. Those include Facebook, Twitch, and Yahoo, among others. You’ll be prompted to enable Flash on these sites when loading them, but Google plans to phase out the Flash whitelist over time. When Chrome 55 rolls out in December, HTML5 will become the default experience. It’s not clear how exactly that will affect the whitelist. The writing is on the wall for Flash; it’s not just Google waging a war on the archaic plug-in. Firefox 48 was announced last week with some Flash content being click-to-play and all Flash being blocked by default in 2017. Even Microsoft is cutting Flash off at the knees. In the Windows 10 anniversary update, Edge uses click-to-play for non-essential Flash elements. Another year or two and we’ll be all done with this.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Now to add Explore Interests to bring you more relevant cards By Ida Torres - August 10, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter When Google first launched Google Now back in 2012, they said that their goal for this feature is that it will give you the information you need without even searching for them. They will do it by asking you what you’re interested in then tailoring the cards that will appear according to your taste. While we’ve been enjoying a fair bit of that, there are still a lot of things missing, and now it seems that Google will be solving that issue through the new Explore Interests feature. Some users have already reported seeing this new feature called Explore Interests and basically it is your way of telling Google the things and issues you’re interested in so they can bring you more tailor-fit cards in Google Now. There are various categories here including People where you can add the celebrities, personalities, politicians, that you want to follow, Sports, TV, Movies, Musicians, and even Stocks. You will also be able to add specific items in these categories. The current set-up is pretty much limited to sports teams, items of interest when it comes to news, but with the addition of Explore Interests, then you’ll be able to expand the scope of your Google Now cards. You won’t need any third-party news aggregation apps since you’ll be able to see the most relevant items to your interests eventually. The Explore Interests feature has not been officially rolled out, although some users have reported seeing it already. Let’s wait fro news from Google before we start complaining that we don’t have it yet.

The favourite won and his main challenger was second, suggesting it all went to script. But it came right down to the very end and after almost three hours of stunning performances, the final hop on a dismount reverses the order of the top two.

He hugs Verniaiev, who makes history by winning their first silver in this event. But that hop has cost him gold. He still looks happy, mind. Then you have Whitlock, winning Britain’s first all-around medal since the 1908 Games. Heartbreakingly, David Belyavskiy comes fourth.

He gets the crowd cheering but could that hop cost him gold and reduce him to silver? Let’s see … Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.36pm EDT 17:36 To win gold in London, Uchimura scored 92.690. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.36pm EDT 17:36 Uchimura, unsurprisingly, goes for a very difficult routine on the high bars and he pulls out his best performance of the evening. That will see him overtake Whitlock, and now all of the pressure and all the eyes in the arena will be trained on Verniaiev. He will need something special to take gold here … because Uchimura has taken 15.8 to finish on 92.365. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.33pm EDT 17:33 It’s very good and he looks confident of his chances. Whitlock looks at the scoreboard … he looks more nervous now than he did while competing. Oh and the good old BBC have decided to change channels just as Belyavskiy’s score is about to come through. It’s 15.133 and not enough for him to take over at the top before Uchimura and Verniaiev complete one of the most captivating events of the Games so far. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.31pm EDT 17:31 Belyavskiy needs 15.260 on the high bars to overtake Whitlock and secure a medal for Russia. Can he do it? Updated at 5.31pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.30pm EDT 17:30 Now Deng is on to the high bar and hoping of a perfect performance to muscle in on the medal reckoning. It looks very good indeed. He is pleased and the landing is near perfect … but it’s only 14.966 and not good enough. Indeed he is 0.1 behind Lin. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.28pm EDT 17:28 Lin scores 14.866, so he is behind Whitlock and now unlikely to win a medal.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.26pm EDT 17:26 Lin, who was fifth entering the final rotation, almost falls after two big tumbles at the opening of his floor routine. No wonder, because Muse has just come on in the arena. He needs 15.277 to move top as it stands … but there will be deductions for landings.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.23pm EDT 17:23 Brooks struggles to a 13.2 on the horse and finishes with a total of 87.632, which will disappoint the US hope.

Photograph: David Davies/PA Updated at 5.33pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.20pm EDT 17:20 The partisan BBC commentators bellow an irritating “Come on Max” at the beginning of the routine and an indescribable roar at the end. It was a very good routine, no doubt, and there was no striking deficiency. He will face an anxious wait to see if he will remain on the podium though. Most of the attention turns to the high bar now. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.17pm EDT 17:17 Realistically the top six will have high medal hopes but it now appears a two pommel horse race between Verniaiev and Uchimura for gold. They are on the high bar for the final rotation, with Uchimura going second last and the current leader the final performer. Belyavskiy is immediately before on the horizontals, following on from Deng. Whitlock is the first up on the floor, with Lin third there. Strap in.

How much will it impact on his score and standing? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.10pm EDT 17:10 And now Belyavskiy makes his claim for a medal with a 15.933 on the parallel bars.

It’s not enough to overtake Whitlock, however. The Chinese gymnast is .077 behind heading to the floor. Meanwhile Brooks scores just a 14.6 on the floor, which does the American few favours. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.03pm EDT 17:03 Lin is on the high bar now, looking to close on Whitlock in the race for third. They are on the same rotation, of course. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.02pm EDT 17:02 From our tennis and boxing man in Rio. You have to agree – some of the coverage has been far too partisan. kevin mitchell (@kevinmitchell50) Some of the BBC flag-waving here is risible. The expert on R5Live - not a journalist - nearly had a heart attack over Max Whitlock just now August 10, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.01pm EDT 17:01 Kato has managed 14.9 on the prallel bars, leaving him well positioned for a final move for bronze. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.59pm EDT 16:59 It’s 16.1 for Verniaiev! That leaves Uchimura and Whitlock with quite the challenge. The latter is on the horizontal and he looks happy his performance, pumping his fists on the apparatus he fell in during qualification. He ends with the floor – is the Briton going to win a medal? He scores 14.7, putting him 2.025 behind Verniaiev but leaving him with a good chance of a bronze. Updated at 5.00pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.56pm EDT 16:56 First up we will watch Verniaiev. He tips out to the end of the bars before going straight across to the other. His dismount is almost perfect and it will surely be a high 15 score. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.53pm EDT 16:53 So for rotation five, the top two and Kato are heading for the parallel bars. Whitlock and Lin are on the horizontals and Brooks and Calvo Moreno take to the floor.

Brooks nails his dismount on the horizontal bar, scoring 15.200 to overtake Kato. While Lin overtakes Brooks thanks to 15.666 on the parallel bars, moving him fourth, just behind Whitlock.

The American swings and swings through his routine before finishing with a double front flip, earning a 15.066 to move him into fourth as things stand.

Ari Levy, CNBC & Rolfe Winkler, WSJ: Walmart & Jet, Google & anti-trust, Uber & China, Elon & Energy, CEOs & bad behavior August 10, 2016 News Roundtable! Ari Levy, CNBC & Rolfe Winkler, WSJ: Walmart & Jet, Google & anti-trust, Uber & China, Elon & Energy, CEOs & bad behavior Hi everyone, Producer Jacqui here. Ari Levy of CNBC and Rolfe Winkler of The Wall Street Journal joined @Jason for a must-see News Roundtable on This Week in Startups. An amazing discussion that kicked off with big deal of the week, Walmart snapping up Jet.com for $3b, that crackled on to Google, the government, anti-trust, the entire U.S. debt problem, the Chinese Market, the very future of energy (featuring, naturally, Elon), and the latest in startup CEOs behaving badly. And more. [ Click to Tweet (can edit before sending): http://ctt.ec/00i8b ] Subscribe in iTunes: http://bit.ly/TWiSTAV And watch here! Some key discussions M&A The big deal of week is Jet.com being bought for $3B by Walmart. What’s behind the deal? Walmart.com has been around since 2000 and has never bridged the gap with Amazon, remaining the #2 player in e-commerce. Could Jet.com & CEO Marc Lore be the answer? Politics & Google What’s the story of Google, the White House, and anti-trust? Google was investigated on anti-trust grounds by the FTC, but ultimately, the decision was made against pursuing any anti-trust case. The Obama administration has been pro-tech and pro-Google. And lobbying works — both parties have been fairly reluctant to launch any anti-trust campaign within technology in the US. Debt in economy Debt-to-GDP in the economy, even after some of the de-leveraging from 2009, is still at a level that is “mind-boggling.” The problem is in private debt (corporate, student loan, credit card, mortgage debt). Is this why millennials do not accumulate assets? Where do we go from here? Bad behavior Using the recent Hampton Creek controversy as a starting point, the panelists debate questionable CEO startup behavior of late. When Silicon Valley prioritizes growth over everything, yet any appearance of impropriety IS impropriety, where is that line … exactly? Elon Musk & the future How much do you want the future to arrive early? Elon would like the world to solve global warming and get off fossil fuels in his lifetime. But we have to decide as a society where to allocate funds. Is there a sustainable, bull market in electric- & self-driving cars? And when you factor in all of the capital and regulatory requirements required, do you bet on Tesla? (or Apple? Google?).

With today’s updates, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides users can now take advantage of Split View and Slide Over multitasking. Google originally updated the Google Docs app with iPad Pro optimization in March, but only now have users been able to take advantage of Split Screen and Slide Over. As a refresher, Slide Over allows users to drag from the side of the display and briefly access another application. Once the user taps back into the original app, however, the secondary app goes away. Split View, on the other hand, allows users to run two apps side-by-side, either split 50/50 or with one app in a smaller window along the side. In addition to Split View and Slide Over support, today’s updates to Sheets, Docs, and Slides include a handful of bug fixes and improvements. Google Docs specifically also gains support for inserting images and inserting page breaks. The updates to Docs, Slides, and Sheets are available now at their respective links below, also check out the full changelog below.

 Google is expanding its tests on the way to blanketing the US in super-fast wireless internet Jillian D'Onfro Aug. 10, 2016, 6:55 PM 17,869 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google A new filing with the Federal Communications Commission reveals how seriously Google is focusing on its plans for a wireless version of Fiber, its high-speed internet service. The company has been testing a new wireless-transmission technology using the 3.5-GHz band in Kansas City, but the heavily redacted FCC filing suggests that it wants to dramatically expand to testing "experimental transmitters" at up to 24 US locations, including Provo, Utah, Omaha, Nebraska, and Boulder, Colorado, for a period of 24 months. Google is requesting authorization to operate between the 3.4 and 3.8 GHz band. "We are working to test the viability of a wireless network that relies on newly available spectrum," a spokesperson tells Business Insider. "The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant Internet access to consumers." Google Fiber's original plan to spread super-fast internet across the US involved running high-bandwidth fiber-optic cable directly to each home that its network would serve. That process has so far proved to be expensive and slow-moving. Since it announced the acquisition of point-to-point wireless-internet company Webpass earlier this summer, the Fiber team has started turning more of its attention to a using a new approach that will pair existing fiber with its own wireless technology. The company has even delayed its Fiber rollout plans in two Silicon Valley cities as it looks for cheaper, wireless alternatives, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Although several of the cities that Google wants to test are already Fiber cities, the tests will be non-commercial for now. All of the end-user devices used for testing will be in the hands of Google employees, contractors, and "'trusted testers' selected by Google on a volunteer basis without payment."

(Screen capture: Google Maps) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Google Maps Google Palestine Related Stories Dutch human rights lawyer claims Israel threatening her Ramallah invalidates new degrees from top Gaza university Israel uproots 400 olive trees in West Bank village Belgian school ‘proud’ of teacher honored at Iran Holocaust cartoon show Jerusalem Police act to end neglect of city’s East Hamas official: Prisoner exchange talks with Israel underway Palestinian man arrested for planning shooting attack Israel intercepts Gaza-bound shipment of commando knives Israeli, US groups for slain troops’ families brief White House Gaza man infiltrates Israel, evades capture for nearly a day Recent days have seen outrage across social media, after an online group claimed last week that Google had removed “Palestine” from its maps. The truth, however, is that Google had never used that term in its web application. The Forum of Palestinian Journalists released a statement in Arabic accusing Google of removing the label “Palestine” from its maps. “The Palestinian media forum condemns the crime carried out by Google to delete the name of Palestine and calls for Google to rescind its decision and apologize to the Palestinian people,” they wrote. “A new crime to be added to the list of those ongoing against the Palestinian people of crimes committed by the global search engine Google on July 25 when it removed the name of Palestine [from its maps].” The statement quickly led to a flurry of activity on Facebook, Twitter and other social media by supporters of the Palestinians who condemned the move, using the hashtag #PalestineIsHere. So far, more than 250,000 people have signed an online petition to put Palestine on the map. But that campaign was begun five months ago, long before Google allegedly removed Palestine, and it has received the majority of its signatures in the past few days. #PalestineIsHere: Google removes Palestine from its maps, replaces it with Israel https://t.co/vpTymAAEJC — RT (@RT_com) August 9, 2016 The reality is that even though 136 UN countries recognize Palestine as an independent state, Google has followed the policy of the US and 49 other countries and has never listed a country named Palestine. “There has never been a ‘Palestine’ label on Google Maps,” a Google spokesperson told the tech news site Engadget on Wednesday. “However, we discovered a bug that removed the labels for ‘West Bank’ and ‘Gaza Strip.’ We’re working quickly to bring these labels back to the area.” Today, Google Maps does show Gaza as a label. However, if one searches for “Palestine,” “Gaza Strip” or “West Bank,” the map shows an unlabeled area contained within a dotted line. The website Disputed Territories in 2014 showed that despite Google’s best efforts, it is extremely difficult to remain impartial. A Washington Monthly report from 2010, cited by several media outlets but no longer available online, explained Google’s attempts to remain impartial and the difficulties that this can lead to: Rather than produce one definitive map of the world, Google offers multiple interpretations of the earth’s geography. Sometimes, this takes the form of customized maps that cater to the beliefs of one nation or another. More often, though, Google is simply an agnostic cartographer — a peddler of ‘place browsers’ that contain a multitude of views instead of univocal, authoritative, traditional maps. The Washington Monthly cited then-director of Google’s public policy team Robert Boorstin: “We work to provide as much discoverable information as possible so that users can make their own judgments about geopolitical disputes.” A boy points to the ‘Google – Palestine’ name change in the Gaza Strip in May 2013. (Abed Rahim Khatib/Flash90) In May 2013, Google changed the tagline on its Palestinian edition from “Palestinian territories” to “Palestine,” in a move that was condemned by Israeli officials. The term “Palestine” is contentious largely because the final status of the Palestinian territories and their borders has yet to be settled through negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. Talks between the parties have been largely at a standstill for over four years, with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s government demanding several preconditions ahead of their resumption.

Google’s Chrome Browser to Block Flash By John Voorhees Yesterday, Google announced that its Chrome browser will begin blocking Flash that runs in the background of webpages in September and make HTML5 the ‘default Chrome experience’ in December. According to Google: Today, more than 90% of Flash on the web loads behind the scenes to support things like page analytics. This kind of Flash slows you down, and starting this September, Chrome 53 will begin to block it. HTML5 is much lighter and faster, and publishers are switching over to speed up page loading and save you more battery life. You’ll see an improvement in responsiveness and efficiency for many sites. … In December, Chrome 55 will make HTML5 the default experience, except for sites which only support Flash. It has been more than six years since Steve Jobs penned an open letter titled ‘Thoughts on Flash,’ in which he concluded: Flash was created during the PC era – for PCs and mice. Flash is a successful business for Adobe, and we can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs. But the mobile era is about low power devices, touch interfaces and open web standards – all areas where Flash falls short. The avalanche of media outlets offering their content for Apple’s mobile devices demonstrates that Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content. And the 250,000 apps on Apple’s App Store proves that Flash isn’t necessary for tens of thousands of developers to create graphically rich applications, including games. New open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win on mobile devices (and PCs too). Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5 tools for the future, and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the past behind. Jobs’ open letter was controversial when it was published. In 2010, Flash was everywhere, serving much of the video on the web and acting as a platform for online gaming. HTML5 was making headway, but it was the clear underdog. Adobe’s initial response to Jobs came from none other than Kevin Lynch, who was the CTO of Adobe in 2010, but is now a Vice President of Technology at Apple, leading the development of watchOS. Lynch announced that Adobe was shifting its focus away from the iPhone and iPad in favor of implementing Flash on Android and other mobile platforms. Flash never got a firm foothold in the mobile world. Roughly eighteen months after Jobs’ open letter, Adobe abandoned Flash for mobile and began to embrace HTML5. Since then, HTML5 has been incorporated into many of Adobe’s products and Adobe has actively participated in its development. The decline of Flash on PCs has been slower, but is likely to accelerate given Chrome’s browser market share, which, according to NetMarketShare, exceeds 50%. Chrome is notoriously hard on laptops’ battery life. In what struck me as a significant understatement, Google says that: Aside from [being prompted to enable Flash on Flash-only sites], the only change you’ll notice is a safer and more power-efficient browsing experience. In a consumer PC market dominated by laptops, better battery life and safety may be the ‘only’ benefits users will notice, but they are nonetheless significant.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Caitlin Dewey August 10 Follow @caitlindewey (iStockphoto) Search engines can reveal some unattractive biases when you squint at them closely. Check out what Google autofills, or displays in its top results, and you’ll see just how entrenched our collective prejudices are re: stuff like “feminine” work or black criminality. Now, thanks to a new paper by a trio of researchers at Brazil’s Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, you can add a new prejudice to the list: Google’s depictions of female beauty, they found, are both ageist and racist. [Google Maps did not ‘delete’ Palestine — but it does impact how you see it] The paper — which has been submitted to the International Conference on Social Informatics but has not yet been published — looked at how Google and Bing represent female beauty in their image search results, particularly when it comes to different age and racial groups. To do that, a graduate student and two professors, Virgilio Almeida and Wagner Meira Jr., scraped the top 50 images for “beautiful woman” and “ugly woman” across dozens of international versions of Google and Bing. They then passed those 2,000-plus images through a program called Face++, which estimates subject age, race and gender with 90 percent accuracy. Sadly, the race and age breakdown of the “beautiful” pictures versus the “ugly” ones are probably what you’d expect. For almost every country analyzed, white women appear more in the “beautiful” results, and black and Asian women appear in the “ugly” ones. (Araujo, Meira and Almeida) Blackness is considered less attractive in 86 percent of the countries surveyed on Google, including countries such as Nigeria, Angola and Brazil, where there’s a predominance of people with black or brown skin. Likewise, beauty is associated almost exclusively with youth — extreme youth, in some countries. In Japan and Malaysia, for instance, queries for “beautiful woman” don’t turn up ladies much older than 23. In the United States, searches for “beautiful” women result in pictures that are 80 percent white, and roughly between the ages of 19 and 28. Searches for “ugly” women are roughly 60 percent white and 30 percent black, and fall into the 30 to 50 age range. (Araujo, Meira and Almeida) This sort of bias has been observed on search engines before, of course — although, in a typical chicken/egg quandary, it remains unclear whether the results shape society, or society shapes the search results. A 2013 paper by Harvard professor Latanya Sweeney found that searches for black names surface more ads related to criminal record history, whether or not the person in question was associated with any crimes. Likewise, a 2015 study from researchers at the University of Washington and the University of Maryland found that Google almost exclusively displays pictures of men for queries like “construction worker.” In 2013, Paul Baker and Amanda Potts, linguistic researchers from Lancaster University in Great Britain, conducted a survey of Google Instant’s autofill results — you know, the zany suggestions Google comes up with while you’re still typing your search term — and observed that racist and homophobic language frequently made it into Google’s suggested answers. They don’t fault Google, though — rather, they conclude that the search engine started predicting racist, homophobic stuff because its users kept entering it. Google is, in other words, rather like our ex-friend Tay: a product of her sorry circumstances. The authors of this latest paper aren’t quite so comfortable absolving Google and Bing of blame. Yes, acknowledged Almeida, one of the co-authors of the paper and a current visiting professor at Harvard: Pre-existing social biases absolutely shape image search results — someone had to upload and tag and post these photos in the first place, after all. But “the way search engines index and rank images” could also contribute to the creation, or at least the enforcement, of stereotypes, he explained by email. “We do not have [enough] information about the techniques used by search engines to rank images and photos,” he said. It’s unlikely that researchers such as Almeida and his co-authors will ever get access to that type of information: Google and Bing guard their ranking algorithms like state secrets. But Almeida says another one of his and Meira’s graduate students is working on “techniques to increase [the] transparency of platforms,” and that both computer scientists remain interested in auditing, and even reverse-engineering, them. Until they have more complete information, however, the researchers are hopeful that companies such as Google and Microsoft will begin re-evaluating their own algorithms. “Given the importance of search engines as source[s] of information,” they write, “we suggest that they analyze the … prominent presence of negative stereotypes and find algorithmic ways to minimize the problem.” Liked that? Try these! Which are, er — not awesome.

When it comes to mobile viewing, user behaviour is noticeably different to that of desktop browsing. Mobile users don’t hang around for more than a couple of seconds waiting for pages to load. Mobile speed is therefore extremely important for building and maintaining a mobile user base. This is where Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages comes into play. AMP is a strict and feature limited extension of HTML, focused solely on speed. So how does it do it? Firstly by limiting features that are known to slow down a browser, for example limiting JavaScript, as no custom JavaScript code is allowed in AMP. Another way AMP speeds things up is by replacing native elements. Img tags for example are replaced with amp-img tags, where size dimensions are no longer optional, but a requirement. AMP then loads in amp-imgs after the page itself, enabling lightning-fast page loads. In this tutorial you will be introduced to the restrictions imposed by AMP, as well as the extensions that allow for richer features, enabling us to produce a quick loading article that doesn’t feel like we are moving backwards in mobile web development. DOWNLOAD THE TUTORIAL CODE NOW 1. Create blank HTML file AMP as a technology is an extension of HTML, so to get started, we need to create a new blank HTML file. In this case, we are going to call it ‘amp.html’, and add in the basic markup for a HTML document. 2. Modify from HTML for AMP Now to turn this into an AMP document, we need to modify the HTML tag. There are in fact two ways to do this, but both simply involve adding an empty attribute to our base tag. It’s possible to either add the unicode high voltage symbol (not shown here) or the word amp. <html lang=”en” ⚡>
or
<html lang=”en” amp> 3. Add in standard meta tags As this is a standard HTML document in a lot of ways, its important to declare the standard meta and title tags. So go ahead and add the code on FileSilo accompanying this step between our head tags 4. AMP-specific header content For the page to function as an AMP document, we need a few specific lines of code in the head of our page. These can be copied as is from ampproject.org. <style amp-boilerplate>…</style>
<noscript>
<style amp-boilerplate>
body{-webkit-animation:none;
-moz-animation:none;-ms-animation:none;
animation:none}
</style>
</noscript>
<script async src=“
https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js”></script> 5. Schema markup While not a requirement for AMP, it is beneficial to describe your page in schema markup. This lets search engines and other sites to quickly and easily pull out relevant information about your article. It gives the added benefit of complete control over how your page is seen. <script type=”application/ld+json”>
{
“@context”: “http://schema.org”,
“@type”: “NewsArticle”,
“headline”: “Speed up the loading time of your articles with Googles AMP”,
“datePublished”: “2016-03-18T18:15:20Z”,
“image”: [
“images/photo-1445346366695-5bf62de05412.jpeg”
]
}
</script> 6. Build a header for our article Now we have a valid AMP document structure in place, we can go ahead and start building the article itself. Starting with the header, we are going to add a title, category, author and publish date. No surprise here as this is all typical HTML markup. <header>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<h1>Welcome to the mobile web</h1>
<p>By Jamie Druce <br />
<time datetime=“2016-03-18T18:15:20+00:00”>
Mar 18, 2016 6:15 pm
</time>
</p>
</header> 7. Add an image the AMP way Now to bring the header alive, we are going to add a feature image immediately after the opening header tag. When it comes to images, standard img tags are forbidden, instead we use the AMP alternative of amp-img. With this element, it is a requirement that size attributes are present, however, to achieve a responsive image. We can set the layout attribute to responsive. <amp-img src=”welcome.jpg” alt=”Welcome”
height=”400” width=”800” layout=“responsive”>
</amp-img> 8. Add the body of our article There are a limited number of standard HTML elements available to you, so to build out the body of our article, it is important to remember we cannot use any JavaScript, or elements where there is an AMP alternative such as images or iframes. For now we are just going to add some paragraphs and headings containing some text. 9. Bring it alive with components If all we could do is add text and images, we wouldn’t have a very exciting article! This is where components come to the rescue. There are a whole host of components that perform various tasks like enabling you to embed a tweet, display a video from Vine or embed a web font. All these components are opt in, this means we need to include an extra link tag in the head of our page for each type of component we wish to use. So go ahead and add the following tags immediately after the AMP script tag: <script async custom-element=”amp-carousel”
src=“https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/
amp-carousel-0.1.js”></script>
<script async custom-element=”amp-youtube”
src=“https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/
amp-youtube-0.1.js”></script>
<script async custom-element=”amp-analytics”
src=“https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/
amp-analytics-0.1.js”></script> 10. Add an image carousel Now to make use of the component we just added to the head of our document, we are going to build an image carousel. Using amp-carousel we can build a container for our images. This is the attribute that will automatically add the interactivity, so drop it into the body of our article. We will set the type attribute to slides as this type supports a responsive layout, and we will add the loop attribute so that users can swipe past the end slide, back to the first slide. <amp-carousel width=960 height=640 type=”slides”
layout=”responsive” loop>
</amp-carousel> 11. Populate the carousel Next we need to add some images to the carousel. Just like before, we need to use the amp-img tag. As a requirement of this tag we must add a height and width attribute, but to ensure our carousel is always 100 per cent width we can make use of the layout attribute once again by setting it to responsive. 12. Embed a YouTube video Another commonly used component is the YouTube embed. As with most AMP components, the YouTube embed requires a size attribute to reduce the workload on the browser, contributing to the pick up in speed. In addition, a simple ID is required. This can be found by navigating to the YouTube video you want to embed and copying the ID from the end of the URL youtube.com/watch?v=sFpMSb0JviQ. 13. Add analytics It’s important to be able to track the content you make available online, and with so many solutions it’s quick and easy to do. Analytics is handled slightly different in AMP. However, the analytics component is simple to use and comes with many standard analytics providers baked right in. The code accompanying this step on FileSilo uses Google Analytics to track page views. So add this to the body and be sure to swap in your own account ID! 14. Style our article When it comes to custom CSS styling you are able to use all the standard syntax with a few exceptions. Firstly, all CSS must be inlined in the head of the page – no linked stylesheets or inline style attributes on elements. Secondly, no !important tags. We will write a few styles to get our page looking more like an article! 15. Style components As well as styling our standard HTML elements, we can also override the styling of AMP components in much the same way. We are going to add a simple background colour to our carousel, so when the page loads in, we get a nice block area instead of white space before the carousel is loaded. amp-carousel{
background-color:#333; } 16. Work around limitations The limitation of no JavaScript can seem like a huge deal to a lot of users, and understandably so. But as previously explained, the reason for its omission is speed. JavaScript blocks the rendering of the page and therefore has a direct impact on page-loading times. While this tutorial shows you how to build a fully functional article without JavaScript, it is possible to build more advanced elements through the use of an amp-iframe, the content of which is rendered after page load, thus avoiding any impact on speed. <amp-iframe width=300 height=300
sandbox=”allow-scripts allow-same-origin”
layout=”responsive”
frameborder=”0”>
<!— Custom code including JS can go here —>
</amp-iframe> 17. Validate your code With a lot of custom elements and restrictions in place, validating you code is an extremely important step. Luckily for us there is debug functionality already baked into our page! It’s time to open up our newly created page in a browser. Once open, you need to open up your web console and add #development=1 to the end of your URL and you should then see some messages in your console confirming the page is valid. http://localhost/amp/#development=1
Powered by AMP ⚡ HTML – Version 1457721872758
AMP validation successful. 18. Common issues If you have been following this tutorial step by step, your page should validate fine. However, there are some common errors you will likely see when expanding the article with your own content. The AMP debugger is very helpful, and as always, the console is your friend here. The most common errors will be from using a non-valid element or not using the required attributes for an element. As you can see here, these are clearly highlighted by the debugger: http://localhost/amp/:55:8
The tag ‘img’ may only appear as a descendant
of tag ‘noscript’. Did you mean ‘amp-img’?
http://localhost/amp/:55:8
The mandatory attribute ‘height’ is missing
in tag ‘amp-img’ 19. Link to a non-AMP article As we’re sure you are quickly becoming aware, AMP is a stripped-down minimal approach. It likely would not make sense to build a desktop article using AMP. Instead you would produce a richer user experience. So if you have a fully featured desktop article, and this AMP version, it is important to link the two. This way we ensure a browser can load the appropriate page for the device. This also has the benefit of informing search engines that both pages contain the same content and this can be done via a single meta tag on each page. <!— Put this tag on your desktop page —>
<link rel=”amphtml” href=“https://www.example.com/article/amp/“>

It has announced that Chrome will soon block the Flash plugin entirely, preventing any content from running. Chrome already disables some Flash elements on web pages automatically. Last September, Google implemented a feature that intelligently turns off Flash content that isn't essential to the page, preventing ad banners, hidden tracking applets and other unwanted material from loading. Most primary content, such as a central game or video player, escapes the policy and continues to display as normal. The user has full control over which Flash elements are allowed to run. They can reactivate disabled content at any time by clicking on it. In a blog post yesterday, Google announced it is now going to take the feature a step further. Starting from Chrome version 53 this September, the browser will begin to block even more Flash content, effectively disabling Adobe's plugin entirely. The focus of the block will again be on hidden page elements powering advertising and tracking facilities. It will be implemented differently to more effectively disable this kind of content, further improving browser performance and power efficiency. Google said that over 90 percent of Flash content still in use on the web loads behind the scenes. This slows the browser down, without providing any immediate benefits for the user. Growing numbers of publishers and ad networks are switching to the newer and lighter HTML5 to power their content but adoption is far from complete. To help speed up the transition, Google will make HTML5 "the default experience" for all web pages later this year. When Chrome 55 is released in December, it will only display HTML5 content by default. For sites which only support Flash, Chrome will prompt users to enable Flash for that site the first time it is visited. The changes reiterate Google's commitment to "de-emphasize" the role of Flash on the web. All the major browser vendors are making similar efforts to speed up the demise of Flash. Flash content is now disabled by default in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Apple's Safari, putting pressure on content publishers to migrate to HTML5. "Flash helped make the Web a rich, dynamic experience, and shaped the modern set of web standards," said Anthony LaForge, curator of Flash in Chrome. "We continue to work closely with Adobe to ensure that your web experience is as fast and secure as possible and to help the Web transition to HTML5." Only a decade ago, Flash was an essential component of the Internet. The technology was once required to show videos and create interactive online content. Today, HTML5 has almost entirely replaced it though. Capable of creating richer experiences than Flash while offering higher performance, HTML5's rise has led to Flash being abandoned by modern web developers. Flash is expected to be gone entirely by 2018. Outdated, banished by browsers and riddled with critical security risks, few are likely to miss the once valuable technology when it finally passes away. With Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Apple and even Adobe itself telling developers not to use Flash, it's only a matter of time before the plugin disappears from the web.

 This woman built a $65 million tech company thanks to Google Julie Bort Aug. 10, 2016, 6:58 PM 20,883 facebook linkedin twitter email print Annie Safoian, founder SADA Systems SADA Systems In 1987, a 32-year-old Annie Safoian moved to Los Angeles from Armenia with her husband, Hovig, and their 9-year-old son, Tony. Today and she and her family run an LA tech company called SADA Systems, a thriving Google and Microsoft reseller expected to do $65 million in revenue this year, she tells us. And she has been fending off a constant stream of offers to acquire the company, for a healthy multiple over revenues. She wouldn't tell us how much money she's been offered, but given the market, offers have likely ranged from hundreds of millions of dollars to as high as half a billion, we understand. But she likes her job and her company, worries a sale wouldn't be good for employees, and simply doesn't care that much about the loot. "We have discussed selling within the family. Everybody wants to buy us. We are in our 60’s, our son is 38 years old. He’s the CEO, my husband is CTO. We've been all together here and working all these years," she says. "If we sell this company and get more money in our bank account, we would still have to do something. My son is very young. We are still so passionate about this technology. It's never boring, but so exciting every single day. Why would I sell?" Back in 1987, when the Safoians first moved to America, she couldn't have predicted her success. Her English was mediocre, she had no technical training and she wasn't exactly sure what she was going to do for a living. But she knew she loved her new home country and became a citizen right away. She took some accounting classes, got a job as a payroll coordinator, which she disliked, yet might have toiled away at forever if the company hadn't laid her off. So she jumped into graphic designed, something she loved, and learned how to build web pages. Her husband found work as a programmer. Slowly, her hard-work ethic had her customers asking her to do more and more tech jobs. One of them asked her to modify their accounting software. She enlisted her husband's help for that and they founded a tech company, SADA Systems, which then went on to manage computers and networks for small businesses, doing small custom apps for customers along the way. 'Hello, this is Google calling' And then, out of the blue, Google called.  Thomson Reuters "The lucky year was 2007 when Google came to us and needed some help for their Google Apps. We were one of their launch partners on Work," she says, referring to Google's plan to sell Google Apps to more businesses. Google also wanted SADA to build a tool that would let its customers easily transfer their email and documents into the Google Apps cloud, she says. SADA agreed to work on that, for no compensation, in exchange for becoming a major, early partner authorized to sell Apps. "We had never had done what they were asking us to do. But we told them we could do it, and worked day and night and delivered it on time," Safoian remembers. To this day, Safoian doesn't fully know how Google found SADA, except through word-of-mouth referrals when it was looking for a company to help it sell Apps for Work in LA. Remember, in 2007, Microsoft's Office ruled, businesses distrusted putting their documents in the cloud, and Google had no experience selling its wares to businesses. It needed to start with smaller but established resellers that could help it get a foothold. Enter Microsoft Business took off for SADA after it began working with Google Apps. Microsoft took notice and convinced SADA to become a reseller for its cloud product, Office 365, too, which Safoian agreed to do. Both companies wanted SADA to help them steal customers away from each other, but she absolutely refused, she says. Sam Yeh/Getty Images "Believe me. You have to be a politician," she explains when asked how it is to work with both companies. "People have to trust you. They know we are going to play this the right way. We will never approach anyone and try to sell them something else. It's never going to happen. We made that clear and now they don’t even talk about it," she says. As the cloud has taken off, and SADA has become a top-tier partner for both Google and Microsoft, SADA has found itself working with bigger and bigger customers and branching out in more areas. It's worked with the Chicago Department of Transportation, University of San Diego, Virgin America, the US Air Force, the state of Maryland, city of Los Angeles and so on, it says. As of this month, SADA will employ 150 people, Safoian tells us. Revenue is expected to hit $65 million this year, up from $50 million last year, she says. All without any VC investment. Her family still owns the company. Why she doesn't want to sell Other successful Google cloud resellers have gone the traditional route and are starting to get acquired. Accenture bought Cloud Sherpas in September for an undisclosed but likely hefty sum. Cloud Sherpas took the traditional startup route and raised nearly $63 million from VCs. It employed over 1,100 people when Accenture bought it.  Safoian knows that it's a risk to turn away potential acquisition offers. But she says it's a calculated risk. "All of a sudden, things might not be going as well. We are willing to take the risk," she says. And there's another reason she and her husband keep advising their son and CEO not to sell. She believes that working for what you want is better than having it handed to you. "One of the things I tell my son every day is you don’t need a lot of money. You want to give your children a chance to create something for themselves, to get the pleasure out of it. If everything is given, there is no fun in it," she says.

Live demonstrations of the online incubator, Caribconnect.net are being offered during an all-day seminar at the Curaçao Chamber of Commerce Auditorium. The day will also include a complementary presentation educating entrepreneurs on Google My Business and Google Plus. The purpose of CaribConnect.net is to initiate exponential growth for Caribbean businesses through the matching of entrepreneurs, mentors and investors. The online incubator is simple to use and is currently free to anyone conducting or wishing to conduct business in the Caribbean. There are three profiles for registration in CaribConnect.net, Entrepreneurs, Mentors and Investors. With over 233 registered members CaribConnect.net is already providing value to its members. When entrepreneurs register for the portal and complete their profile with details such as length of time in business and type of business CaribConnect is able to make recommended matches to mentors or investors who have also registered as CaribConnect users. The portal, CaribConnect.net, offers tools for entrepreneurs such as templates for business plans and financial plans and educational opportunities through online resources that help them profile their businesses to prospective mentors and investors. The Caribbean is full of talented and successful business men and women, however the geography of the Caribbean islands often presents challenges in meeting and connecting with one another. CaribConnect.net and its online capabilities dissolves this challenge. Mentors who sign-up with CaribConnect are able to input their areas of expertise and CaribConnect will display its search results with registered entrepreneurs that are looking for such expertise. Mentors can be investors and investors can be mentors, once registered as an investor or mentor, entrepreneurs that are seeking investment or mentorship can be viewed. “CaribConnect has been showing excellent results since with entrepreneurs using the business plan template. To date, over 87 business plans have been uploaded into the CaribConnect.net site.” said Hans Verschoor, Ecorys’ Key Expert on Business Incubation. In additional to providing access to this online incubator, COSME continues to add value to local businesses with a presentation by Tim Quinton, expert on Google My Business and Google Plus. Google offers the strongest presence on the internet and it is important for entrepreneurs from Curaçao to ensure they are maximizing their online exposure. When entrepreneurs set up their businesses on Google My Business, it allows their phone number, address and website all to be visible and trackable as part of a user’s search results. Google My Business allows entrepreneurs to adjust and control how their businesses appear on Google search and Google Maps. COSME has very limited space in this workshop. Entrepreneurs interested in learning more about Google My Business and CaribConnect.net should register by emailing kirstenr@curacao-chamber.cw by August 22nd. The COSME programme specialises in the development of the micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the 12 Overseas Countries and Territories, and was launched on April 1, 2014 in Tortola, BVI. The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the sustainable economic diversification and prosperity of Caribbean Overseas Countries and Territories by improving the competitiveness of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in the participating Territories.

 Take an immersive tour of Rio’s favelas in Google’s new interactive web documentary Clinton Nguyen Aug. 10, 2016, 12:53 PM 1,800 facebook linkedin twitter email print José Junior, a director of Afroreggae, maps the unmapped favelas using a Google Street View camera. Google Ever wondered what goes on in Rio when the Olympics aren't there? A new Google Arts & Culture project gives a glimpse into life in the city's favelas, the informal, largely unmapped slums that house one in five people in the city. Called "Beyond the Map,"  the project gives viewers virtual, 360-degree tours that combine photos, videos, guided voiceovers and short documentary films to give a closer look into the lives of the favelas’ vibrant, diverse residents. It's a illuminating look into what have been considered invisible neighborhoods — until recently, the favelas were largely unmapped. On Google Maps, many favelas look like this: An unmapped favela above a major highway. Google Living without an address or location on a map makes it hard for favela residents to obtain official documents or access the city's emergency services. Imagine you had to report a crime or a fire — how would you communicate where you lived if it doesn't show up on a map? Plus, it's difficult for potential tourists to navigate the confusing network of informal neighborhoods without maps, and hard for potential customers to find local businesses.   “A big part of an identity is having an address. The favelas are not simply a place, but they are a people,” says a Brazilian narrator, introducing the "Beyond the Map." The project gives a Google Street View- style look inside certain favelas, where you can pan the camera in any direction, or click on interactive elements that bring up photos and videos about local businesses, individuals, lifestyles and culture.  Google While the favelas suffer from high crime rates and are often marked for police "pacification," "Beyond the Map" also shows a more positive perspective by introducing viewers to some of the neighborhood's residents. The project introduces viewers to a woman named  Paloma, who lives in a favela called Maré, is taking computer science at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro to learn how to develop artificial intelligence programs. Another resident, named Luis, is learning ballet at the Theatro Municipal, despite being threatened by bullies for engaging in an activity deemed too “feminine.” Part of the project also sheds light on some of Google's efforts to create actual maps of the favelas. One of the videos features an initiative called “ Ta no Mapa, ” which is a partnership between Google and a Brazilian cultural group called Afroreggae. The organization recruits volunteers to walk around favelas with Google Street View cameras latched to their backs.  The same favela shown above, after Google Street View surveys. Google Redes da Mare, another non-profit group, is also helping with the mapping project by giving names to streets and places. Sometimes, the group gives a neighborhood a blank name, to be filled out later by residents. It's a daunting task, with nearly 1,000 favelas to map. But having an address surely beats seeming invisible.

Google Explains Why It Didn’t Label Palestine in Maps The matter has caused quite the stir on social media Aug 10, 2016 17:03 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google Maps is one of the leading navigation applications around the world, used by millions of people to get around in a new country or city. However, it seems that a recent matter has caught the attention of users from Palestine. A Gaza City-based journalism group claims that the nation of Palestine has been wiped from Google Maps, which has caused quite an outrage on social media, including Facebook and Twitter. The Forum of Palestinian Journalists has said in a statement that the group “condemns the crime carried out by Google in deleting the name of Palestine, and calls for Google to rescind its decision and apologize to the Palestinian people.” Washington Post reports that Middle-Eastern media has demanded that Google relabel the region or even all of Israel as “Palestine.” The only discrepancy is that the region wasn’t labeled in such a way in the first place. Google has reached out to Engadget and stated that "there has never been a 'Palestine' label on Google Maps, however we discovered a bug that removed the labels for 'West Bank' and 'Gaza Strip.' We're working quickly to bring these labels back to the area." When users click on certain cities in the area, Google defines them as Palestinian and shows a dashed border around them. In addition, the provided Wikipedia knowledge box on Maps describes Palestine as a "de jure sovereign state," the same term that was set by the United Nations back in 2013. The misunderstanding caused many from the region to switch to other geographic mapping services, like Apple Maps. The issue only goes to show how even an application can cause quite the stir in certain countries of the world, especially if they’re politically sensitive. #Google Maps#social media#Apple Maps#Facebook#Twitter reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Maps Features WiFi Only Mode and Offline Maps to SD Cards HERE Maps Rebranded to HERE WeGo, Welcomes New Features Google Adds New App Categories in the Play Store Google to Roll Out Mass Transit Delays and Wi-Fi Only Features to Maps iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon    Google Maps view of Palestine New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Honor 8 Hands-On Impressions: Some High-End Specs Mixed with Premium Design more on: Honor 8 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google says that insanely scary new Android vulnerability isn’t really that scary Chris Smith BGR NewsAugust 10, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share A security research company came forward with information detailing a potentially dangerous set of security flaws tied to Qualcomm’s chips that are used in a significant number of mobile devices, saying that more than 900 million Android devices are at risk. However, Google followed up on that research, saying that 90% of those devices should be protected against QuadRooter, even if the actual vulnerabilities aren’t patched. DON’T MISS: Google’s new Nexus phones will be just as fast as the Galaxy Note 7 Unearthed by Check Point, the four vulnerabilities are yet to be patched by Google and its partners, even though Qualcomm already made the fixes available. Google deployed three of the four patches, while others are likely behind when it comes to security updates. But it turns out that a feature that’s available in Android versions including Android 4.2 and later can protect users against QuadRooter. That means 90% of active Android devices out there already have built-in protection against QuadRooter. In order for hackers to hijack a user’s device with the help of QuadRooter, the user needs to install a malicious app from a third-party store first. But Google says its Verify Apps feature combined with Safety Net will block such apps from being installed. "We appreciate Check Point's research as it helps improve the safety of the broader mobile ecosystem,” Google told Android Central. “Android devices with our most recent security patch level are already protected against three of these four vulnerabilities. The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2016-5340, will be addressed in an upcoming Android security bulletin, though Android partners can take action sooner by referencing the public patch Qualcomm has provided. Exploitation of these issues depends on users also downloading and installing a malicious application. Our Verify Apps and SafetyNet protections help identify, block, and remove applications that exploit vulnerabilities like these." Even so, to make sure you’re truly protected against malicious threats on Android, remember one simple rule of thumb: Do not download apps from any place other than the Google Play store.

But I’m sold on how Project Fi handles wireless connectivity abroad, and believe this is the model for other carriers to follow. It’s transparent, simple, and is way better than the ridiculous international plans offered by others. If you’ve ever thought about going with Google’s take on a wireless network, here's how my experience shed some light on how things work and why I think Project Fi is vastly superior to the way most carriers operate. THE SCENARIO I used a Nexus 5X with a Project Fi SIM on a recent cruise in Europe which, after the usual debacle from the airlines, added on Germany to an itinerary that included the Netherlands, UK, Ireland, and France.  Project Fi is much more straightforward: You start with $20 for unlimited domestic and international calls, while every GB of data you use costs $10. This eliminates the mystery that often comes with such a venture, as many carrier plans require confusing and expensive options for traveling overseas.  Project Fi is what’s known as an MVNO, or mobile virtual network operator. MVNOs don't actually build their own towers. Instead, they use other networks to give you a connection. So you may be on T-Mobile in one nation and O2 in another. But it all means the same as far as your connectivity and MVNO bill. In the U.S., it’s T-Mobile, Sprint, and U.S. Cellular. Even better, Project Fi phones (Nexus 6P, 6, and 5X) are engineered to automatically hop between these networks and open Wi-Fi in order to try and give you the best signal. Overseas, Fi connects to you whichever carrier Google has partnered with in one of 135 supported countries. It was a pretty seamless experience, as once I hopped off a plane in Frankfurt and then again in Amsterdam, I was connected right away. THE EXPERIENCE No matter which country I was in, I had no issues finding new service. In Amsterdam, most of the UK, Ireland, and France I had LTE connectivity, part of a recent rollout designed to boost Project Fi’s appeal. I was limited to 3G in the Channel Islands, which are obviously more remote than mainland Europe.  Yet given how essential our phones are to everyday work and play, it made finding somewhere to eat or looking for a specific venue much easier than going back to the days of haranguing a paper map. And even though the Fi number was not the same as my personal line, there are plenty of third-party messaging apps that made staying in contact easy. There are some extra fees, however, for going international. Phone calls back to the states will cost you, as voice calls are around $0.20 per minute, depending upon the country. International tethering is charged at the same $10 per GB rate, but it creates a separate column on your bill. I even took a phone call while in England, and the person I spoke with back in California found the quality to be rather good. The Project Fi app makes all the international rate details rather straightforward.   Project Fi is extremely transparent about your charges, which is very nice to have. The Project Fi app keeps a running tally of this on your phone or inside of your account on the web. Back in the states, Project Fi is innovative but less practical for many since there are currently no family plans. And it only works on three Nexus phones: the 6P, 5X, and 6. While the 6P offers pretty good hardware, it’s quite big and isn’t as good in the looks or camera department as the Galaxy S7 Edge.  Yet if you take Project Fi for what it is, you’ll find a reliable companion for international travel and a rather clever wireless service. Google’s goal is likely to nudge the entire industry into more consumer-friendly policies that make it easier to get online. It’s certainly enlightened self-interest, as the more people go online the more they’ll see Google ads and buy apps and games. At least, however, you’ll be able to do that with greater ease the next time you head outside the country. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Man-in-the-middle attackers can abuse the WPAD protocol to hijack people's online accounts and steal their sensitive information even when they access websites over encrypted HTTPS or VPN connections, said Alex Chapman and Paul Stone, researchers with U.K.-based Context Information Security, during the DEF CON security conference this week. WPAD is a protocol, developed in 1999 by people from Microsoft and other technology companies, that allows computers to automatically discover which web proxy they should use. The proxy is defined in a JavaScript file called a proxy auto-config (PAC) file. The location of PAC files can be discovered through WPAD in several ways: through a special Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option, through local Domain Name System (DNS) lookups, or through Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR). Attackers can abuse these options to supply computers on a local network with a PAC file that specifies a rogue web proxy under their control. This can be done on an open wireless network or if the attackers compromise a router or access point. Compromising the computer's original network is optional because computers will still try to use WPAD for proxy discovery when they're taken outside and are connected to other networks, like public wireless hotspots. And even though WPAD is mostly used in corporate environments, it is enabled by default on all Windows computers, even those running home editions. Lucian Constantin On Windows, WPAD is used when the "automatically detect settings" option is checked in this configuration panel. A rogue web proxy would allow attackers to intercept and modify non-encrypted HTTP traffic, which wouldn't normally be a big deal because most major websites today use HTTPS (HTTP Secure). However, because PAC files allow defining different proxies for particular URLs and can also force DNS lookup for those URLs, Chapman and Stone created a script that leaks all HTTPS URLs via DNS lookups to a rogue server they control. The full HTTPS URLs are supposed to be hidden because they can contain authentication tokens and other sensitive data as parameters. For example, the URL https://example.com/login?authtoken=ABC1234 could be leaked through a DNS request for https.example.com.login.authtoken.ABC1234.leak and reconstructed on the attacker's server. The researchers showed that by using this PAC-based HTTPS URL leak method, attackers can steal Google search terms or see what articles the user has viewed on Wikipedia. That's bad enough from a privacy perspective, but the risks introduced by WPAD and rogue PAC files don't end there. The researchers also devised another attack where they use the rogue proxy to redirect the user to a fake captive portal page, like those used by many wireless networks to collect information about users before allowing them on the Internet. Their fake captive portal forces browsers to load common websites like Facebook or Google in the background and then performs a 302 HTTP redirect to URLs that can only be accessed after the user authenticates. If the user is already authenticated -- and most people have authenticated sessions in their browsers -- the attackers will be able to gather information from their accounts. This attack can expose the victims' account names on various websites, including private photos from their accounts that can be accessed via direct links. For example, people's private photos on Facebook are actually hosted on the site's content delivery network and can be accessed directly by other users if they know the full URL to their location on the CDN. Furthermore, attackers can steal authentication tokens for the popular OAuth protocol, which allows users to log into third-party websites with their Facebook, Google, or Twitter accounts. By using the rogue proxy, 302 redirects, and the browser's page pre-rendering functionality, they can hijack social media accounts and in some cases gain full access to them. In a demo, the researchers showed how they could steal photos, location history, email summaries, reminders, and contact details for a Google account, as well as all documents hosted by that user in Google Drive. It's worth stressing that these attacks do not break the HTTPS encryption in any way, but rather work around it and take advantage of how the web and browsers work. They show that if WPAD is turned on, HTTPS is much less effective at protecting sensitive information than previously believed. But what about people who use virtual private networks (VPNs) to encrypt their entire Internet traffic when they connect to a public or untrusted network? Apparently, WPAD breaks those connections, too. The two researchers showed that some widely used VPN clients, like OpenVPN, do not clear the Internet proxy settings set via WPAD. This means that if attackers have already managed to poison a computer's proxy settings through a malicious PAC before that computer connects to a VPN, its traffic will still be routed through the malicious proxy after going through the VPN. This enables all of the attacks mentioned above. Most operating systems and browsers had vulnerable WPAD implementations when the researchers discovered these issues earlier this year, but only Windows had WPAD enabled by default. Since then, patches have been released for OS X, iOS, Apple TV, Android, and Google Chrome. Microsoft and Mozilla were still working on patches as of Sunday. The researchers recommended computer users disable the protocol. "No seriously, turn off WPAD!" one of their presentation slides said. "If you still need to use PAC files, turn off WPAD and configure an explicit URL for your PAC script; and serve it over HTTPS or from a local file." Chapman and Stone were not the only researchers to highlight security risks with WPAD. A few days before their presentation, two other researchers named Itzik Kotler and Amit Klein independently showed the same HTTPS URL leak via malicious PACs in a presentation at the Black Hat security conference. A third researcher, Maxim Goncharov, held a separate Black Hat talk about WPAD security risks, entitled BadWPAD. In May, researchers from Verisign and the University of Michigan showed that tens of millions of WPAD requests leak out onto the Internet every single day when laptops are taken outside of enterprise networks. Those computers are looking for internal WPAD domains that end in extensions like .global, .ads, .group, .network, .dev, .office, .prod, .hsbc, .win, .world, .wan, .sap, and .site. The problem is that some these domain extensions have become public generic TLDs and can be registered on the Internet. This can potentially allow attackers to hijack WPAD requests and push rogue PAC files to computers even if they're not on the same network with them.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Quadrooter app malware can be blocked by the old ‘Verify Apps’ feature By R Padla - August 10, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Last year, we were faced with annoying Stagefright vulnerabilities. Google and some OEMs vowed to tackle the issue by releasing regular software updates some of which come in the form of monthly security patches for Android. This time, we are being challenged by the QuadRootera app as a new Android malware that we said actually reminds us to stay with Google. QuadRooter is a new threat that has already been blocked on most Android devices. About 90% of Android-powered mobile phones and tablets are now secure as made possible by a security feature that’s been around since the Android 4.2 version. QuadRooter is usually found in any Android phone that is powered by a Qualcomm processor. It’s an app that could let another malicious app to have root access. Once rooted, the app can do anything to the smartphone. This QuadRooter usually comes when “Unknown Sources” is enabled. Installing app can be done manually from anywhere which makes the phone a quick target of the malware. There’s a simple solution for that. You see, the “Verify Apps” feature is enough for anyone to prevent the malware app from being installed into your phone. This particular feature is a part of Google Play Services. Google designed this for the purpose of protecting an Android device. As early as Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, the “Verify Apps” feature has been doing its job of protecting a phone from possible attacks. Google itself confirmed that Verify Apps can block what QuadRooter is doing. Apps with QuadRooter can be identified and then blocked easily. Google sent out a statement saying that the latest security patch level is protected already. In a statement, Google said: “We appreciate Check Point’s research as it helps improve the safety of the broader mobile ecosystem. Android devices with our most recent security patch level are already protected against three of these four vulnerabilities. The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2016-5340, will be addressed in an upcoming Android security bulletin, though Android partners can take action sooner by referencing the public patch Qualcomm has provided. Exploitation of these issues depends on users also downloading and installing a malicious application. Our Verify Apps and SafetyNet protections help identify, block, and remove applications that exploit vulnerabilities like these.” Google is hard at work in ensuring that Android devices are always protected. Vulnerabilities will come and go, some may even remain, but the tech giant offers many ways on how to detect and prevent them. The idea is that Android would show an “Installation has been blocked” prompt to let the user know a possible threat was prevented. Verify Apps may be an old feature but some may have to enable it first in the Security section of the Google Settings app. Most phones have this on default but others have to enable Verify Apps manually. Android security isn’t perfect but Google is making sure that solutions are underway.

Google is making good on its promise of "HTML5 by default" for the Chrome browser. Next month's release of Chrome 53 begins blocking Adobe Flash on the Web and replacing it with HTML5, which, before the end of the year, will become the standard in version 55. "This is similar to a change we made last September, when some Flash content became click-to-play with Chrome 42," Anthony LaForge, curator of Flash in Chrome, wrote in a blog post. "This had an immediate, positive impact for our users by improving page load times and saving battery power." HTML5 will become the primary experience on Chrome, as long as a website offers it. Visit a site that requires Flash, and the browser will display a prompt at the top of the page asking if you want to run it. "Aside from that, the only change you'll notice is a safer and more power-efficient browsing experience," LaForge said. Since the Web is not totally rid of Flash — and to "avoid over-prompting" — Google's browser will continue to support Flash on the top 10 sites that use it: YouTube, Facebook, Yahoo, VK.com, Live.com, Yandex.ru, OK.ru, Twitch.tv, Amazon, and Mail.ru. This "whitelist" will expire after one year, and the Chrome team will periodically revisit it to remove sites whose usage no longer warrants an exception. //Related Articles Firefox to Ditch Flash by Default in 2017 Google also plans to add policy controls for enterprises, allowing users to manage individual site preferences, including the ability to completely disable the feature. Last fall, Chrome 45 began automatically pausing less-important Flash content like ads, animations, and any "non-central" content. The move "significantly reduces power consumption, allowing you to surf the Web longer before having to hunt for a power outlet," Google said at the time. Facebook, Vimeo, Netflix, YouTube, and Twitch followed suit, beginning the transition from Flash to HTML5.

Mainstream and social media outlets in the Middle East are demanding that Google relabel "Palestine" on its Maps. The outrage comes after a Gaza City-based journalism group early this month released a statement claiming the Web gaint had wiped the nation of Palestine from its digital maps service. In its proclamation, the Forum of Palestinian Journalists said it "condemns the crime carried out by Google to delete the name of Palestine," and calls for Google to rescind its decision and apologize to the Palestinian people. This move to "falsify history and geography" and deny the Palestinian people's right to their homeland is "a failed attempt [to] tamper [with] the memory of generations of Palestinians and Arabs," the Forum added. There's just one problem: Google Maps never used the "Palestine" label, and therefore never removed it, either, according to a source close to the company. The Internet could instead turn its attention to a bug within Maps that has temporarily removed labels for the "West Bank" and "Gaza Strip"—an issue Google is currently working to remedy, the source said. A search today results in an unlabeled area, delineated by a dashed line stretching from Jenin to Hebron and from Jerusalem to Jordan—the "West Bank," considered a "de jure sovereign state" since 2013 by the United Nations. //Related Articles Google Maps Offline Features Simplify Travel That's the same view Zak Martin saw five months ago, when he launched a Change.org petition for Google to add Palestine to its map. "The omission of Palestine is a grievous insult to the people of Palestine and undermines the efforts of the millions of people who are involved in the campaign to secure Palestinian independence and freedom from Israeli occupation and oppression," according to the petition, which is still nearly 38,000 signatures shy of its goal. Google declined to comment on the situation. Back to top Previous : Google Maps Offline Features Simplify Travel How a Blurry Cow Highlights Weaknesses in Google's Face Reco...

But could it replace traditional video conference calls? By Alison DeNisco | August 10, 2016, 8:15 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus In one depiction of Google's telepresence drone, a screen dangles off the front while a projector sits at the rear. Image: Google Conference calls may soon take flight, literally: On Tuesday, Google was awarded a patent for a video conferencing drone, complete with cameras, microphones, and projection screens. While current video conferencing solutions allow multiple users to interface electronically with both audio and video, each user typically has to be sitting in a conference room or in front of their laptop. With Google's video conference drone system, users could have more flexibility, and be able to move around different locations while on a conference call. "Implementation of a mobile telepresence system on a relatively compact and operationally efficient airborne platform such as a quadcopter may provide significant improvements in, for example, speed, maneuverability, energy consumption and the like, facilitating access to spaces which may be otherwise difficult to access by a larger and less maneuverable platform," the patent stated. SEE: Quick glossary: Drones (Tech Pro Research) The drone could either be powered by a cell phone that sits in the drone and connects it to the internet, or it could be paired remotely with another device, the patent stated. Telepresence robots used for remote office workers are already on the market. However, these tend to be cumbersome, and cannot go down stairs or travel on rough terrain. Google's device could potentially follow a person around while they are on a call in any type of location. "This patent is an extension of the current telepresence robot concept, that provides a new mode of transportation," said Gartner analyst Mark Hung. "In some ways it's more flexible, because it could go up and down stairs and move more easily around obstacles." While telepresence robots that roll around the office work great inside four walls, "this drone concept would allow architect structural engineers to inspect a construction site without having to leave their office," said David Chao, chief strategy officer at audio and web conferencing service provider ReadyTalk. "It does not change communication in and of itself, but it allows that remote person to examine things in a really meaningful way." Chao said he doesn't see drone conferencing used in an average office. Specific challenges to the concept may include noise from the drone, and its short battery life. But, they could be very useful in performing work in difficult-to-reach places, he added. "The smarter the machines, the less often a person has to do things that are dangerous to them," Chao said. Once drones were built with video capabilities, many people used them for inspecting energy plants and the like. Adding call capabilities would significantly increase the potential for more field applications, and getting better information across. The patent comes on the heels of last week's White House meeting, in which officials announced a series of initiatives to promote integrating drones into the daily lives of consumers and businesses across the US. While the current regulations do not allow the automated, long-distance delivery flying proposed by Google and others, Google's drone delivery service Project Wing will begin conducting experiments at an FAA-approved drone test site, the White House said. Consumers shouldn't expect to see the new conference drones on the shelf any time soon—as with all patent applications, it mostly tells us that Google is exploring the concept, rather than definitely creating it. "People are still exploring the best ways to remotely project themselves and make collaboration more effective," Hung said. "This is probably more of a conceptual thing than something that will be commercially available in the next two to five years." The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers On Tuesday, Google secured a patent for a telecommunications drone to be used for video conferencing. The device could give users more flexibility, and allow them to conference in without being connected to a laptop, the patent stated. While telepresence robots for remote office workers are already on the market, they tend to be difficult to maneuver and cannot go down stairs. The conference drones could bring video to hard-to-reach places. Telecommunications experts foresee video conferencing drones being used for remote inspections and work that might be dangerous for humans.

Close share panel Image copyright Google Image caption Playing poker in the role of a dog could help to deter trolls in virtual reality Google is exploring ways to prevent players harassing each other in virtual reality. The company's Daydream Labs has been experimenting with ways to deter people from making others feel unsafe or uncomfortable. One demo for the HTC Vive encouraged respect among poker players by representing them with avatars of dogs. The experiments have been designed to discourage behaviour that may distress others. In one, players standing to approach their opponent are encouraged to sit down by the screen turning black and white. They are also guided back to their seat by a coloured personal space bubble, and the fact their opponent could no longer see their avatar. Image copyright Google Image caption Once the player stands up, the screen goes black and white and their opponent is left looking around for them "If we can anticipate the actions of others, then we may be able to discourage negative social behaviour before it starts," Google said in a blogpost. "For example, by designing personal space around each user, you can prevent other people from invading that personal space." Virtual reality transports users into virtual universes through the user wearing a headset, and in the case of the HTC Vive and Sony's forthcoming PlayStation VR system, interacting using handheld wireless controllers. However, such autonomy presents some players with the opportunity to get unnecessarily close to others, which may cause them distress. Another of Google's experiments rewards players for what it perceives as positive behaviour. Players in a game where each avatar's digital hands are visible are rewarded, with firework animations, for high-fiving each other, while attempts to punch or shove fail to register at all. The technology has also been used to help treat people with severe paranoia. Patients were shown computer-generated social situations to help reduce their paranoid delusions. "With virtual reality, we can help the person to relearn that they are safe, and when they do that, the paranoia melts away," said Prof Daniel Freeman, a clinical psychologist at Oxford University's Department of Psychiatry.

Through malicious apps, these vulnerabilities can give attackers access to all the sensitive data on a Qualcomm-based device. However, Google has announced that the 'Verify Apps' feature in Google Play Services effectively blocks all apps with QuadRooter vulnerabilities from installing. This 'Verify Apps' feature is available to Android devices running on v4.2 Jelly Bean and above, which according to Google's latest figures comprise 90.6 percent of active devices visiting Google Play. The feature is activated by default on all Android devices above that version number, and unless a user has manually gone and disabled the feature, your device should be safe from the QuadRooter vulnerability. What this feature does is that it verifies apps, and blocks those detected as malicious apps from being installed on Android device. If a user tries to install an app with an exploit, it blocks the installation and displays an "installation has been blocked" message with no option to ignore and install anyway."We appreciate Check Point's research as it helps improve the safety of the broader mobile ecosystem. Android devices with our most recent security patch level are already protected against three of these four vulnerabilities. The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2016-5340, will be addressed in an upcoming Android security bulletin, though Android partners can take action sooner by referencing the public patch Qualcomm has provided. Exploitation of these issues depends on users also downloading and installing a malicious application. Our Verify Apps and SafetyNet protections help identify, block, and remove applications that exploit vulnerabilities like these," a Google spokesperson told Android Central. The vulnerability is said to be based on Qualcomm chipsets, and will affect all Android devices powered by those SoCs. The QuadRooter vulnerability can give the attacker access to sensitive data, and even let them record audio and video. Some of the popular devices said to be affected by the new QuadRooter flaw include BlackBerry Priv, Google Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, HTC 10, LG G5, Moto X, OnePlus 3, and Samsung Galaxy S7 among others. The Blackphone 1 and Blackphone 2 can also be exploited by the Quadrooter vulnerability. Just for added security, it is recommended to avoid side-loading of apps, and thoroughly examine any app installation request before accepting.

As of March 2015, Google averaged about one meeting a week with the Obama administration, and Google staff frequently move into jobs with the White House, or vice versa. But the figures on meetings and revolving doors don't always show how Google maneuvers those relationships when facing a fight. More than 1,500 pages of emails The nonprofit group Campaign for Accountability recently launched a project to compile documents about the company's lobbying practices, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The group says the repository of documents will be a resource for monitoring how Google interacts with the government. The first installment, which the group obtained through an independent researcher and shared with The Verge, features more than 1,500 pages of emails between the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and Google employees. In the email exchanges, Google employees coordinate their messaging with the White House, occasionally steering around divisions within the administration. Nothing in the documents suggests improper behavior; they are a window into Google's high-level work on policy matters, and provide a case study on how deep the company's lobbying efforts go. Provides a case study of a Google persuasion campaign In December 2012, Google saw a threat, as thousands of representatives met at the World Conference on International Telecommunications to consider a proposed revision of the International Telecommunication Regulations, which govern how communication services are used around the world. After years, the conference was set to determine whether to bring more of the internet under the purview of the regulations. The US government had a seat at the table, as did Google, which sent private industry delegates to the conference to advise the US. Google cast opposition to the revision as a fight for internet freedom, and certainly others in the tech industry took that line, although critics argued Google was more interested in preventing increased costs for using global network infrastructure. The emails obtained by the Campaign for Accountability help sketch the anatomy of a Google persuasion campaign, as the company detected and dealt with perceived problems before, during, and after a crisis. "We're not making any judgements or drawing any conclusions about specific policies that Google has pursued," says Anne Weismann, the Campaign for Accountability's executive director. It's not clear how the campaign is funded, and the group declined to discuss donors, including any who may conflict with Google. "Our only bias is that Google is not transparent enough," Weismann says. "Our only bias is that Google is not transparent enough." Discussions with the White House started weeks ahead of the conference, the emails show, and the White House alerted Google to an issue early on. R. David Edelman, senior advisor for Internet Policy, reached out to the company after documents related to WCIT began to leak. "Since Google is mentioned by name several times here, I thought you should see if you haven't already," Edelman wrote to Google Senior Policy Counsel Johanna Shelton, sending her a Forbes article. As the conference started, Google contacted the Office of Science and Technology Policy with concerns that the State Department would agree to an unfavorable deal. Ross LaJeunesse, a delegate to the conference and then Google's Global Head of Free Expression and International Relations, wrote an email to the White House's Edelman expressing worry that the United States would sign on rather than face "the optics" of being one of the few countries not to. Google was concerned a deal would be reached LaJeunesse wrote that his "read" was that the State Department was "interested in reaching a deal." At the end of the note, he wrote, "Please keep my fingerprints off this, but given our mutual interest in this working out well for the internet/innovation..." Edelman replied that he had faith in the delegation ambassador appointed to negotiate the talks, but agreed that the proposal then under consideration was unacceptable to the Office of Science and Technology Policy. After Google sensed that potential hurdle, it went to great lengths to convince the State Department that it was making the wrong move. At one point, "Eric" — likely referring to then-executive chairman Eric Schmidt, although his last name isn't mentioned — made a call to Hillary Clinton's office. "I understand that Eric personally called Secretary Clinton's office, which was an impressive show of force," Edelman wrote to LaJeunesse in an email. "I'd be curious to know his reaction to the conversation." It's unclear who "Eric" spoke to: Clinton herself, or a member of the staff. (Schmidt is now a supporter of Clinton's presidential campaign.) Ultimately, 89 countries out of the 151 participating signed on, with the United States one of those against. It was a complicated, mixed result: the final decision reached may have been more about signaling what binding resolutions could be made, rather than actually passing such resolutions. LaJeunesse, in an email to Edelman, bluntly said "we lost," although Edelman responded, "The world lost. This treaty now has no legitimacy." "I understand that Eric personally called Secretary Clinton's office, which was an impressive show of force." It's difficult to say what role Google, which declined to comment, may have had in the US decision to not sign. But the company and the Office of Science and Technology Policy discussed working for the same cause, even against others in government with misgivings. After the vote, Edelman suggested a "post-WCIT huddle" with LaJeunesse, and again alluded to internal disagreements. "I'd like to hear your thoughts on what worked, what didn't, and where to go from here," Edelman wrote. "And let me just say what's been said a thousand times: thank you for you and your team's tireless efforts — even amidst adversity within our own ranks — on behalf of the US and the free Internet." Exchanges between LaJeunesse and Edelman also discussed how to talk about WCIT publicly. "I'm working with DC team for a strategy of how to characterize WCIT (victory, loss or a less manichean spin) and what that, in turn, means moving forward," LaJeunesse wrote. The emails show LaJeunesse and Edelman set up a private meeting, as Edelman wrote that a White House delegate gathering could resolve questions over "how to discuss the issue." Ultimately, whatever discussions were had about how to discuss the vote, Google continued ringing alarm bells. In a statement later sent to reporters, a Google spokesperson said the vote showed that "governments want to increase regulation and censorship of the Internet."

Diana Budds 08.10.16 7:00 AM As a profession, "designer" is constantly evolving. Fifty years ago, chances are you'd either be a graphic designer, industrial designer, or furniture designer. In five decades, you might be an artificial organ designer, a cybernetic director, or fusionist, according to some futurecasting pros. But today, one of the most in-demand jobs is that of the user experience (UX) designer—a by-product of our increasingly digital world, where a strong user experience is essential to remain competitive. One challenge for this relatively new job title? There hasn't been a clear path toward acquiring the skills. Likewise, discovering employees with the right set of talents is difficult for employers. That's according to Google, which along with the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) has developed a BFA in User Experience Design, one of the first four-year undergraduate degrees to be offered in the field. The partnership came about naturally—as Google was familiar with SCAD's diverse design course offerings—SCAD is willing to experiment with its approach, and both felt like there was "gap" in design education that needed to be filled. A corporation taking a heavy hand in education raises some eyebrows with respect to potential conflicts of interest. Who's profiting from the arrangement—the corporate sponsor, the university, or the students? Is receiving a degree with Google's seal of approval the digital design equivalent of getting certified in entrepreneurship from Trump U or in burger chefing from Hamburger University? Not quite (thankfully). Mike Buzzard, a UX design manager at Google, is working closely with SCAD's leadership and professors to develop the curriculum and argues that the rationale behind the course isn't to turn SCAD into a feeder school. "Its teachings are more general to the UX profession at large," he says. "We're really trying to create a pipeline that’s larger than Google's needs." Here's how the tech giant and the design school are shaping the curriculum. A Foundation In Fundamentals—And Research While the new degree might be focused on an emerging type of design, Google and SCAD mined the existing course catalog to form the interdisciplinary curriculum. It includes foundational studies in drawing, color theory, and the basics of design. From there, students move to more advanced classes in typography, logic, art history. anthropology, math, programming, and information architecture, to name a few. Students learn the basics—but from many different fields. Of the 34 required classes students must complete to earn the degree in UX design, five are brand-new courses developed by Google and SCAD: studios on research, ideation, prototyping, communication, and a sponsored collaboration. The program aims to equip students with the foundation they need enter the UX design job market—whether their potential employer is Google or another entity. Google serves on the steering committee for the major and will continue to tweak the curriculum as it evolves. Though the Silicon Valley tech giant has lent its name and expertise to the program, it receives no financial kickbacks. Moreover, it costs the same for students as any other undergraduate field of study. (Total full-time tuition for one academic year is $35,190.) Jason Fox, chair of the graphic design department at SCAD, has been leading the strategy from the university's side of things, along with deans from the School of Digital Media, School of Design, and School of Communication Arts. To him, teaching scientific methods alongside more traditional creative pursuits is the strength of the program. "The immersive experiences that Google, Facebook, and Twitter are creating require anthropological understanding of how behavior informs decisions." "When you think of teaching someone visual design, it's about the aesthetics and the understanding of visual trends that compel people to act," Fox says. "But in the digital world, the interactions become critically important. The immersive experiences that Google, Facebook, and Twitter are creating require anthropological understanding of how behavior informs decisions." To Buzzard, using research to guide and inform decision-making is essential for user experience design (UXD). For example, the most obvious problem might only be evidence of a much larger issue. "You can teach craft, but there’s a break between decorating and designing and we have to teach students about finding the primary problems and how to respond," he says. Students learn about human behavior, how to conduct user testing, and other research methods to sleuth user insights. The core of the behavioral research component of the program is rooted in anthropology and SCAD's design methods focus on "rapid ethnography," or learning as much as possible about a group or individual quickly. While research is the foundation for UXD, interpreting that information and developing solutions using design fundamentals is critical to executing a product well. "It does not do any good to make decisions that defy the laws of physics," Fox says. Learning To Collaborate Across Industries Another essential part of the program is making students comfortable with leaning on the expertise of others, since the complexity of digital problems often involves calling upon experts from different fields—programming, visual design, marketing, etc.—and synthesizing what they have to say. "We want to teach the students confidence in collaboration," Buzzard says. James Simmons entered SCAD as a graphic design student, and though he liked the classes he was taking, he wasn't sure if they had enough breadth. When he learned of the UX program, which was introduced in November 2015, he liked the multidisciplinary approach and switched majors. In addition to learning from professors in different departments, he also works with students who come from different backgrounds. Collaborating with other students is one half of the lesson; learning how to work within companies is another. Recently, he worked on a group project that involved coding and visual design to make a better program. Seeing how everyone approached the problem and used the research to inform solutions was enlightening. "The most influential part of the team was that none of us were specifically designers or developers. We all had multiple hats," he says. Collaborating with other students is one half of the lesson; learning how to work within companies is another. To that end, Google is sponsoring a course in SCAD's Collaborative Learning Center, an internship-like program in which outside companies—like BMW, HP, Microsoft, and Adobe—provide a problem as a case study for students to solve. This gives students insight into how companies think, and companies get a fresher perspective on what they're tackling. (Depending on how you value "experience" and résumé building, this also treads into the murky area of young designers essentially giving away their work unpaid.) While Google is still deciding upon the "problem" that it wants to solve during its fall CLC program, students can expect to have direct access to employees at the company. "The major shift here, which is university-wide but the UX program really encapsulates, is [an emphasis on] industry partnerships," Fox says. "It's saying 'I’m ready' as opposed to saying, 'I have a foundation, now teach me your process.' Students in CLC-sponsored classes sometimes leave with texting-level relationships with people at companies. These are classes where you work with someone for 10 weeks, and it's so immersive that you begin to know each other on a personal basis. That’s invaluable in this industry. Even if you don't get a job [at the company who sponsored the CLC class], you might get recommended for another." A Mission Bigger Than One School The UXD program was introduced in November 2015, and there are about 26 students currently enrolled, most of whom will be sophomores in the 2016-2017 school year. Google hopes that the framework that it set up serves as an open-source model that other universities can replicate or augment if they so desire. You can see the rubric of classes that compose the degree here. The cachet of Google is big right now, but who knows what the future holds. "We’re trying to understand how we can open source something like this so other schools can figure out their own recipe and influence and provoke each other," Buzzard says. Eventually he'd like to build up an alumni network that can bring the program to other universities. "We’d like to share what has worked, what hasn’t worked, and what the solid building blocks are. We don't want to be overly prescriptive, but share what we believe to be essential." The UX designers of the future don't necessarily need SCAD and Google to become great—just as any degree from any institution is never a golden ticket—but the road the two organizations are paving is one way to get there. The cachet of Google is big right now, but who knows what the future holds. If the program does what it intends—arming students with the foundation to become independent thinkers—they should be equipped to evolve along with the industry, even if Google is no longer the industry darling. "Everything will change," Simmons says, "and you need to learn the fundamentals to be comfortable with change." [All Photos: courtesy SCAD] Never miss a story.

Come September, Google Chrome 53 will begin blocking Flash, such as the kind that loads "behind the scenes," as Google says, which can slow down casual web browsing. HTML5 is a lot less resource-heavy and when pages utilize it, it improves battery life, page loading and responsiveness across the web. Following Chrome 53, in December Chrome 55 will go even further to make HTML5 the default browsing experience, excepting only sites with Flash-only support. You'll be given the option to enable Flash when you visit, so it won't change too much from the way you already browse the web. Last year, Chrome began blocking some Flash ads already, so you've likely already seen some of the effects trickling down during regular internet use if you use Chrome, after all. What this means is you'll likely see a lot fewer hang-ups when using previously Flash-heavy sites, and fewer crashes to have to worry about -- that's the hope, anyway. It's part of a larger transition of the web to HTML5, and has been in the works for some time now.

Its soaring stock Google’s latest moonshot? Its soaring stock Posted on Wednesday, August 10, 2016 by CNN in Business News Google isn’t just the 800-pound gorilla of online search. It’s now an $800 stock too. Shares of Google parent company Alphabet hit an all-time high Tuesday of more than $813 a share. The company is now worth $555 billion. Only Apple, with a market value of $586 billion, is worth more. (Google was briefly the most valuable company in the world earlier this year.) Alphabet’s stock is up just 4% this year though, in line with Apple. So Google has lagged the performance of two other members of the so-called FANG of four in tech. Amazon — also at an all-time high — is up nearly 15% while Facebook has soared almost 20% this year. Netflix is the only laggard in the group. Shares are down about 20% so far in 2016. But even though Google/Alphabet hasn’t surged as much as some other big techs, there is no denying that it is doing extremely well. Part of that has to do with the fact that investors are embracing most large tech stocks in general. The Nasdaq hit an all-time high Tuesday — its first since July 2015. But Google (is it OK if I just call it Google?) isn’t just riding the Nasdaq’s coattails. The company is still growing at a rate that would make most companies envious. Analysts are forecasting that profits will increase more than 15% this year and that sales will be up 20%. That’s truly remarkable when you consider just how colossal Google is. Sales are expected to top $88.5 billion this year and exceed $100 billion in 2017. It has now been a year since Google announced that it was reorganizing into Alphabet. Since then, the company has continued to post solid gains in its core Google search business, as well as YouTube and Android. But the startups in the Alphabet empire — companies that the company classifies as “other bets” — continue to lose money, despite healthy revenue growth. The “other bets” division includes the Google Fiber Internet access business, connected home device unit Nest and its life sciences division Verily. Investors continue to express hope that many of these so-called moonshots will eventually pay off handsomely. But investors also seem less worried that Google will continue to plow money into unprofitable businesses indefinitely. That’s because the company’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, has promised more fiscal discipline at the company. Porat, who Google hired away from Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley last year, has won raves from analysts and investors. She, along with executive chairman Eric Schmidt, are viewed as the financial reality checks for the pie-in-the-sky dreams that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin continue to have. Along those lines, Google is widely reported to be working on a deal to sell its Boston Dynamics robotics division to Toyota. So Google may have more room to run. And while many investors are more enamored with Amazon and Facebook because of how rapidly they are growing, Google is no slouch either. The company has more products (seven) with at least a billion users than Facebook, whose Messenger service just became the fourth Facebook feature to reach the billion user milestone. (Google’s core search business, Android, YouTube, Maps, Chrome, Google Play and Gmail each have more than a billion users.) It won’t be a huge shock if Google’s stock crossed the $1,000 level within the next few years either — rarefied air that only a few companies, including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, trade above. Wall Street analysts currently have a consensus price target of $943 for Google. That’s nearly 20% higher than current levels. At that price, Google would be worth nearly $650 billion. It’s why some think Google could be the first U.S. company to one day top the (say this like Dr. Evil) ONE TRILLION DOLLAR mark.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 10, 2016 at 8:40AM Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi recently jumped on the virtual reality bandwagon with a device called the Mi VR Play, which is tethered to a companion app loaded with VR films and other content. The device will work with any 4.7" to 5.7" phone, but Xiaomi recommends using its Redmi Note 3 for an optimal experience. The Mi VR Play has two main differences from similar headsets -- smartphones are secured by a zipper, and it comes in a wide variety of flashy prints and colors. Image source: Xiaomi. However, Xiaomi isn't selling the headset to mainstream consumers yet -- it's currently only available to a limited number of beta testers for a nominal price of 1 yuan ($0.15). It's unclear how big the beta group is, but Xiaomi claims over a million people signed up when the program was announced on Aug. 1. Let's take a closer look at the Mi VR Play and what it means to Xiaomi. Another evolution of Google Cardboard To understand where the Mi VR Play fits into the VR market, we should examine the evolution of VR headsets. Two years ago, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google jump-started the VR market by introducing Google Cardboard. The simple DIY kit -- which generally includes a folded piece of cardboard, two 45mm focal length lenses, a single magnet, and a rubber band -- lets users convert most smartphones into entry-level headsets. This low-tech approach reached a lot more consumers than Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) high-end approach with the $600 Oculus Rift, which must be tethered to a high-end PC. Google's Cardboard app has been downloaded up to 10 million times from the Google Play Store, and that popularity inspired developers to create and port more VR apps to Android. Third-party companies started developing more durable and comfortable versions of the Cardboard with plastic cases, nose pads, and head straps. Xiaomi's headset seems to resemble these devices, which generally cost less than $10. Last year, Samsung launched the Gear VR, another mobile-powered headset which included optimized sensors for head-tracking, OS-level changes for boosting latency (which reduces headache-inducing lag), and external physical buttons for controlling the device. The $99 headset, which was co-developed by Oculus, connects to the Oculus Home ecosystem and is only compatible with Samsung's top-tier smartphones. Google Cardboard (L) and Samsung's Gear VR (R). Image source: Company websites. Understanding the Chinese VR market Huawei, one of Xiaomi's main rivals, recently unveiled the Huawei VR headset, which is only compatible with its P9, P9 Plus, and Mate 8 smartphones. Since those devices only have 1080p screens, the image isn't as crisp as the Gear VR's 1440p display. However, the Huawei VR has 360-degree audio, latency comparable to that of the Gear VR, and comes with free videos, games, and panoramic content in its companion app. The device's price hasn't been announced yet. During the second quarter, Xiaomi was ousted from the top five smartphone makers worldwide by Chinese rivals Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo -- which respectively claimed the third, fourth, and fifth spots behind Samsung and Apple, according to IDC. Therefore, it wasn't surprising that Xiaomi launched its own VR headset to keep pace with its competitors. Chinese smartphone makers probably aren't trying to generate revenue by selling the headsets. Instead, they're building VR app ecosystems similar to Oculus Home and Google's Daydream. Since Google Play is blocked in China, the major Chinese OEMs all offer their own Android app stores. The revenue from these stores helps offset the paper-thin margins of their smartphone businesses. What VR means to Xiaomi Xiaomi has been pivoting away from smartphones, which have become brutally tough due to the saturation of the Chinese market, and toward internet-based revenue from apps, games, and online-to-offline services. Xiaomi generated $564 million in internet-based revenue last year, but that missed the company's own target of $1 billion. Xiaomi's VR app. Image source: Xiaomi. If Xiaomi launches its VR app for all Android devices, it can expand its ecosystem onto other devices -- especially those which aren't already tethered to major app stores. That would be similar to what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) did when it launched the Kindle app and Amazon AppStore across all Android devices, and would prioritize the growth of its ecosystem over the sales of lower-margin physical devices. That push could complement Xiaomi's expansion into smart homes with smart TVs, set-top boxes, air purifiers, lights, wearables, and other devices. It's logical for Xiaomi to expand into the VR market, but I doubt that the initiative will truly differentiate its brand, ecosystem, and devices from the rest of the Chinese smartphone market. Its rivals are doing the same thing, and consumers can easily buy similar "plastic Cardboard" or "budget Gear VR" devices from other vendors. Therefore, Xiaomi's effort is worth watching, but I don't think it's a game-changing development for the Chinese VR market.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

We’ll have to wait and watch if it comes to India anytime soon. Google is testing its virtual assistant – Google Now – to add new features to it. According to a report on Android Police, Google Now will get ‘Explore Interests’ feature that will allow users to customise updates they are interested in tracking. The site put out screenshots sent with the new ‘Explore Interests’ tab. Users can choose from a number of categories like Sports, TV, Movies, Musicians, Movies, People and Stocks. Google Now’s ‘Explore Interest’ tab has a strap which says, “Customize your interests.” The tab further reads, “Get updates on your interests. Pick teams, bands, movies, and more.” After a user clicks on categories they are interested in, the feature displays sub-categories under ‘Popular In Your Area’ section. For example, there’s Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead and more in ‘Popular In Your Area’ TV section. There’s Donald Trump, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders in People category. Users can simply click on the plus sign besides these sub-categories to track updates. According to the site, the Google Now update is rolling out slowly for users. We’ll have to wait and watch if it comes to India anytime soon. Voice-assistants are increasingly becoming popular and have found their way other devices apart from smartphones.  The Google Now update comes at a time when companies like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon are working to make their virtual voice-assistants more user-friendly. Apple recently announced that it will bring Siri to Mac. We’ll have to wait and see how it works out for users once it is rolled out commercially. Though Cortana for Windows has been there for a long time now making it easier for users to browse through stuff on their system. Also, Cortana has made its way to Xbox One, which has made searching for features during game play a lot easier.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Craig Federighi and Eddy Cue on learning from Maps debacle and improving the service By Christian Zibreg, Aug 10, 2016 Tweet 10 Comments Monday, Fast Company interviewed CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives, with Cook revealing that public iOS betas actually exist to help improve the Maps service, which was widely panned and ridiculed over egregious inaccuracies shortly after its September 2012 debut. Today, the publication interviewed Eddy Cue, Apple’s boss of Internet Software and Services, and Craig Federighi, who is Apple’s chief of Software Engineering, on learning from Maps failures. Here’s what they had to say about improving Maps over the years. Noting no one is developing maps “in a significant” way except Apple and Google, Eddy Cue said that everyone else, including Nokia, TomTom and Uber, is doing it “with a very narrow focus.” In Apple’s view, Maps is a crucial component of the user experience, basically “a core organizing structure for the physical world in which you interact.” Because many apps use maps, Apple’s executive team had to make the decision and they knew they didn’t want Apple to depend on a third-party like Google for mapping. Maps development and maintenance is a very time-consuming process which never stops, said Cue, because each and every day businesses are opening and closing, streets are changing, highways are being built and so forth. “Here’s another thing about Maps: It’s expensive,” said Cue. Apple has thousands of people working on Maps, he revealed. It’s very, very expensive, and it doesn’t have a direct revenue stream. So when I say it’s only Google and us who are developing it, well, that’s part of the reason why. You can’t be a company going out and developing maps to make money; at least no one’s figured that out. To ensure the accuracy of Maps, Apple is crowd-sourcing data from iPhone users. Cue described this data-gathering process by giving the following example: Let me give you a good example: a golf course. How do we know when a new golf course opens up? We’re not exactly driving around looking for golf courses. But we know it’s there, because there are all these golf apps that get used at a golf course. If we see that all these golf apps are being used at a particular location, and we don’t show that as a golf course, we probably have a problem. You can discover that pretty quickly. It’s not as if you need a year, or anything like that. To confirm important places like golf courses and airports, Apple’s so-called ground truth specialists use a variety of sources, including the web, satellite images and more. “In a worst-case scenario, you would have to drive by,” he quipped, adding: Airports are the same thing. Runways get developed, but you don’t always really know because many are private. Roads closing, bridges closing—these are really all data problems, because the truth is we don’t really need anyone to tell us that the bridge is closing. The moment a bridge is actually closed, you can immediately see the effect. When it comes to personal information, an iOS device learns your commute patterns so that it could tell you that you need to leave early because there’s a lot of traffic on your way home, but that intelligence stays locally on the device and is never sent to Apple or synced with iCloud. “So we keep that intelligence on the device, but we can anonymously track things like traffic patterns,” said Federighi. Was the team embarrassed by the 2011 Maps debacle? You bet, said Cue. Look, the first thing is that you’re embarrassed. Let’s just deal with that one fact of emotion. I mean, these things mean a lot to us. We work really hard, and so you’re embarrassed. In the case of Maps, what it causes you to do is ask: How important is this? Is this a place where we need to triple down or quadruple down, or did we make that mistake because it’s not that important to us? A big part of the Maps equation is third-party data that Apple obtains for the service from a number of providers, and much of it is inconsistent. “You’ll get a feed from someone who provides information about restaurants, and they’ll refer to location in a different way, in terms of latitude and longitude, from your base map,” said Federighi. “There’s a huge data-quality issue there, and I don’t think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis. Going through that lesson in a very public way gave us all the motivation we needed to say we’re going to do this really well.” The whole piece is a fascinating longform read and you’re wholeheartedly recommended to enjoy it in your own time, or you can save the article for later in Safari’s Reading List, Pocket or some other read-later service.

Prasoon Singh I really want to try Apple Maps but I just don’t trust it. Rowan09 Where do you live? It’s gotten a lot better and i really have no issue with it. Google still has more POIs but Apple isn’t as far behind like it once was anymore. Bill I’ve travelled across the US a lot and haven’t had too many issues with Maps. On rare occasion it directs me to a place that no longer exists. I reported said locations, included a picture of them being clearly empty and closed, and opted for email followup. A week or so later those locations no longer showed on Maps. No service is perfect but we can all help make them better the more we use them. Rowan09 So true. I went to store that was closed and did the same thing and in 2 days the area was no longer showing for that location, instead it was labeled closed. Marcus I live in Southern California and I’ve been using Apple Maps since it’s initial release. I’ve driven all over California and I don’t think I’ve ever had problems with it. I probably use it 15-20 times a year too. I guess I’ve just gotten lucky. CltrAltDelicious Apple Maps is great in NYC. No complains! edwilk55 It just sux how they are still lagging behind in basic mapping features. * Having a quick link to Home and Work. Why the hell do I have to type Home or Work to get directions? * Searching and Adding multiple stops along route. * Alternate routing, such as highway avoidance. I wish they’d make basic functionality job one as well as accuracy so it could become my go to mapping app. Hell, I have Car Play in my truck and still use Google Maps 99% of the time. I know GM has just recently added in some of these features, but they NOW have them. And they’ve had the accuracy. SMH @ Apple! Rowan09 It does alternating routing automatically now and in IOS 10 as you stated you can avoid highways and tolls. I would like them to put an option to avoid parkways for truck drivers or commercial vehicles here in NY. You also don’t need to type home or work because it’s in favorites but I get your point. I never tried to add a favorite on the home screen yet on IOS 10 QP Just deleted that useless app after it gave me wrong direction to reach a place, now i only use googlemaps.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines This Mac app lets you switch between recently used apps via Touch Bar A running list of great iOS and macOS apps on sale this week President-elect Trump promises tax incentives for Apple to build “Made in USA” iPhones Apple could slash prices of next year’s 4.7″ and 5.5″ iPhones with legacy LCD technology iPhone 8 to hit mass production late in the third quarter of 2017   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClearClockView, PullOver, & more… PullOver lets you pin an app to your screen for easier multitasking Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Photograph: Google Maps Simon Usborne Wednesday 10 August 2016 09.55 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 10 August 2016 17.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Stick, say, “Wales” into Google Maps: a solid red outline shows the country’s borders, the interior is given a red tint and the word “Wales” shows up in bold red letters. Wales is Wales is Wales. Now search for “Palestine” to get a sense of how fraught cartography has become in the digital age. This time we get a dotted grey line, no red tinting and no “Palestine”. Cue outrage in the occupied territories. “The move is designed to falsify history, geography as well as the Palestinian people’s right to their homeland,” the Forum of Palestinian Journalists said in a statement. There’s now a hashtag (#PalestineIsHere) and a pre-existing online petition has more than 260,000 supporters. Strong stuff, but mostly wrong. Google says there has never been a “Palestine” label, although the company conceded that a bug had removed labels for “West Bank” and “Gaza Strip”. They now show up with the full red-tint treatment. And the dotted line? Simply one of the tools of digital mappers, who are frequently damned however they depict a contested globe. Here’s a neat example. Look at the Crimean peninsula on Google Maps UK – it’s separated from Ukraine by a dark-grey dotted line to mark a disputed border. Look at it on Ukrainian Google Maps and the dotted line is light-grey, of the sort used to demarcate states. On Google Maps Russia? A solid black country border, showing Crimea as part of the country. “I guess, naively perhaps, we hoped we could have one global map of the world that everyone used, but politics is complicated,” Ed Parsons, Google’s geospatial technologist, said in 2014. “We’re seeing a move towards what we call agnostic cartography,” says Steven Feldman, a digital mapping consultant who has written about the issue. “Mappers have to try to represent different points of view where they can, but sometimes have to make a choice: maps that comply with local laws, or no maps at all.” The penalty can be harsh. In May, India drafted a law that would allow a fine of up to 1bn rupees (£11.5m) for anyone who published “wrong or false topographic information” about its disputed borders with Pakistan and China. The bill soon disappeared, but Google already complies, showing dotted lines outside India and solid lines inside. The stakes can get higher still. In 2010, faulty Google data briefly gave a chunk of Costa Rica to neighbouring Nicaragua. Troops were deployed before a correction eased tensions. “Google maps are of very high quality,” the company said in a statement that could be applied to the latest dispute before it goes any further, “[but] by no means should they be used as a reference to decide military actions between two countries.” More features Topics Google Maps Palestinian territories Middle East and North Africa Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home election 2016 US world opinion sports soccer tech selected arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home election 2016 US world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech selected arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Technology › Google Maps Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Facebook Blocks Your Ad-Blocking Facebook is taking a stand against ad-blockers by interfering with the way they operate. The social network will soon “begin showing ads on Facebook desktop for people who currently use ad blocking software”. Which means hundreds of millions of people are about to get annoyed. How is Facebook possibly going to achieve this seemingly impossible task? By disguising sponsored content so that ad-blockers no longer know what to block. Ad-blockers only work because advertising is easy to spot, but Facebook thinks it can successfully blur the lines. Harassing people about adblockers and then having hideous pop-ups and loud ads on your site is a good way to get them never to come back. — hushicho (@hushipro) August 1, 2016 To help soften the blow, Facebook is improving its ad control options for users. Those who are bothered by the ads they see on Facebook will be able to add and remove interests and businesses in order to fine-tune the whole experience. In other words, you’ll still see ads, but they should be more relevant and useful ads. Two things will happen here: 1. The ad-blockers will fight back, and this will descend into a brutal game of cat and mouse. 2. Real content is likely to be filtered out as ad-blockers ramp up their efforts to control the flow of information Why the Fight Back Against Ad-Blockers Should Matter to You Now Why the Fight Back Against Ad-Blockers Should Matter to You Now Ad-blocking has changed our browsing experience.

But it was the reaction his comments garnered online which are of real interest here. Trump said, “Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. But the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know.” This statement could be taken a number of ways, but the way most right-thinking people have taken it is that Trump was making a joke about Clinton possibly getting assassinated.

If any web site wants to try to restrict ad blocking, it needs to own up to its responsibility for the risk of malware installation and either host its own advertising as a first party or audit and guarantee the safety of 100% of the advertisements being served from third parties. If they're not willing to take those steps, there's no rational reason for end users to stop blocking ads.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Copperhead OS: The startup that wants to solve Android’s woeful security A multi-billion-dollar megacorp, Google, apparently needs help to secure its OS. by J.M. Porup (UK) - Aug 10, 2016 1:36 pm UTC Login to bookmark 121 Guardian Project A startup on a shoestring budget is working to clean up the Android security mess, and has even demonstrated results where other "secure" Android phones have failed, raising questions about Google's willingness to address the widespread vulnerabilities that exist in the world's most popular mobile operating system. "Copperhead is probably the most exciting thing happening in the world of Android security today," Chris Soghoian, principal technologist with the Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, tells Ars. "But the enigma with Copperhead is why do they even exist? Why is it that a company as large as Google and with as much money as Google and with such a respected security team—why is it there's anything left for Copperhead to do?" Copperhead OS, a two-man team based in Toronto, ships a hardened version of Android that aims to integrate Grsecurity and PaX into their distribution. Their OS also includes numerous security enhancements, including a port of OpenBSD’s malloc implementation, compiler hardening, enhanced SELinux policies, and function pointer protection in libc. Unfortunately for security nuts, Copperhead currently only supports Nexus devices. Google's Android security team have accepted many of Copperhead's patches into their upstream Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code base. But a majority of Copperhead's security enhancements are not likely ever to reach beyond the its small but growing user base, because of performance trade-offs or compatibility issues. Dan Guido, CEO of Trail of Bits, has also puzzled over the vulnerability gap between the stock Android OS and Copperhead, and points out that the same could not be said for Apple's iOS. "If I had to imagine a world where there's a Copperhead for iOS, I don't even know what I'd change," he tells Ars. "The Apple team almost always picked the more secure path to go and has found a way to overcome all these performance and user experience issues." A billion people around the world rely on Android to secure their digital lives. This number is only going to grow. How did we get here, and can Copperhead—or even Google—put out the garbage fire? Enlarge / A general outline of Copperhead's main features. A deal with the devil Google did a deal with the devil for market share, says Soghoian, who has described the current parlous state of Android security as a human rights issue. By giving Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and wireless carriers control over the end-user experience, Google allowed handset manufacturers to find ways to differentiate their products, and wireless carriers to disable features they thought would threaten their business model. As a result, Google's power over OEMs—such as Samsung or Motorola, who manufacture and sell Android handsets—consists solely of the Android license and access to the Google Play Store. The AOSP code base is licensed with Apache 2.0, and the kernel uses GPL2, which means there's nothing stopping OEMs from deploying stock Android under a different name. But doing so would also mean losing access to the Play Store. This gives Google significant leverage over OEMs, but by no means absolute control—a competitor willing to forgo the Android trademark and offer customers access to their own app store, as Amazon has done, can walk away from the negotiating table with little to no consequence. But Soghoian thinks Google isn't trying very hard. The company could, he points out, demand that OEMs implement default full-disk encryption as part of the Android and Play Service licence terms. The company currently requires FDE when the hardware supports it, but extending that requirement to lower-end Android manufacturers might scare off a non-trivial fraction of OEMs—and that would hurt Google's bottom line as an advertising company. "The important thing to remember," he says, "is that if Google goes nuclear and cuts an OEM from the Google Play store, and Gmail, and Google Maps, and YouTube, Google isn't just hurting that OEM and its customers, it's also hurting itself." "Every phone that doesn't have YouTube and Google Mail and search is a phone that isn't making money for Google," he adds. Copperhead, for their part, are not in the business of surveilling users in order to display targeted advertising and so are free to optimise Android for security. Their first challenge was to find a handset to support that offered regular security updates—no small ask. Just the Nexus, thanks Most OEMs, for instance Motorola, do not ship the monthly security updates available from the AOSP. The business model for handset manufacturers ends with the sale to a consumer—at which point there are no financial incentives to maintain the devices for the next three years or so. Copperhead chooses to focus on optimising security for what they believe are the most secure handsets currently available: the Nexus devices whose software, if not hardware, Google controls directly, and which receive prompt monthly security updates. "What we're doing is starting with the Nexus; a pretty good starting point," Copperhead's Daniel Micay explains. "And we're significantly improving the security of the operating system. We're making a lot of under-the-hood changes and exploit mitigation to make it harder to exploit the vulnerabilities that are there." Micay's goal is to port the Grsecurity and PaX patches to the Android Linux kernel, which would dramatically improve the security of all Android handsets, but this goal has been stymied by hardware woes—some of which not even Google appears capable of resolving, at least not on its own.

hypebot digital music and the music business Home D.I.Y. Music Tech Social Media Music Biz More News MusicThinkTank Never Miss A Beat! Stay Connected With Hypebot.com « WED. BRIEF: Gaye Heirs Sue Sheeran • Cox BMG $25M Verdict Affirmed • Fox Orders Shazam Show • More | Main | Music Celebration: 4 Must-Have Items For Any Concert » Restaurant, Bar, Venue Lobbyists Stupidly Applaud DOJ Decision David Lowery examines how such an unpopular decision as the 100% licensing decree handed down by the Department of Justice came to pass with a little help from Google, and how it could negatively impact the ability of venues to license music. __________________________________  By musician and artist advocate David Lowery of The Trichordist (Performing rights organizations or PROs are unions of songwriters.  They are also licensing organizations that peform a valuable service to the public.  They allow a quick way for any business big or small to get a license to play music.  You’ve heard of BMI, ASCAP right? These are the main two PROs. There are also two other smaller ones SESAC and GMR.  But most of this blog concerns the DOJ rules that govern BMI and ASCAP). I’m gonna make this very easy for everyone to understand.  These are the companies and organizations that make up the MIC-Coaltion.   As a venue or restaurant your interests in music licensing are represented by National Restaurant Association, Alcohol Beverage Licensees or National Retail Federation. They are all members of this group. As far as we can tell this was the only group (along with Google) that was pushing the DOJ to change song licensing from the historical and internally accepted standard of fractional licensing to “100% licensing.”   Or forcing a single co-writer to license the song for everyone else. Google (the de facto leader of the MIC Coalition)  especially wanted songs to be licensed this way because of the threatened lawsuit above.  See Google could get a license to many of Pharrell (and other GMR artists’) songs, by getting DOJ to force his BMI and ASCAP co-writers to license songs. Clever right?  That’s why  Google formed this coalition right about the time this dispute began. And let’s not kid ourselves, Google formed this coalition and drove the entire lobbying effort.  Google to restaurants and venues:  “Kumbaya,  Let’s all work together to keep our songwriter royalty rates low.” Translation: “Hey restaurants, bars and venues want to be human shields?” Yes, in reality Google was simply using these other organizations as human shields. It was quite predictable that restaurants, bars and venues would end up as collateral damage. Google doesn’t care about anyone but Google. This is Renata Hesse.  She is the Acting Assistant Attorney General of US.  She oversees DOJ Antitrust Litigation Section III that has decided to meddle relentlessly in music licensing space.  She also represented Google when she was in private practice right before she (re) joined the DOJ. She has been the DOJ point person on this issue.  She even met with songwriters to explain to them why this new rule would be good for them! How nice!  Too bad she should have recused herself from this matter because she worked for Google on Antitrust issues before coming back to DOJ. Can you say conflict of interest? She also violated Obama administration ethics rules by getting involved in this. Shortly before the MIC Coaliton was formed the DOJ put forth this proposal to radically change how music is licensed. Odd timing? Did Mic Coalition leader Google know it was coming?  Many people in the music industry (both creators of music and users of music) were  perplexed by the DOJ sudden fixation on the issue.   Until the DOJ put forth this bizarre “fix” for something that wasn’t broke, no one in the industry (music creators or users) questioned the fractional licensing of songs. It was so perplexing my own congressman Doug Collins asked the Register of Copyrights to explain (see above). And this is the response from the Register of Copyrights. In the recent Copyright Office music licensing consultation, NO ONE asked  to change music licensing from fractional to 100% licensing (see above). The Copyright Office makes it unequivocally clear. So who supported and pushed this change?  How did it emerge as an idea from the dark Googley recesses of the DOJ? Even though this was a change that no one but Google seemed to want, the DOJ with former Google lawyer Renata Hesse leading the charge went ahead and initiated the rule. Above is the US Constitution.  Songwriters have constitutional rights (although lately I’ve come to doubt it). For instance we have a right to make legal private contracts with our co-writers without the federal government later making them illegal.   In order for Renata Hesse and the rest of the can’t-shoot-straight DOJ antitrust gang to institute this new rule without violating existing private contracts between songwriters,  the final rule is incredibly complex.  Unless hundreds of thousands of songwriters (or their estates) go back and modify co-writing agreements with hundreds of thousands of co-writers, hundreds of thousands of songs (maybe millions) will no longer be available for licensing.  This rule change requires a vast re-ordering of the music licensing system that will likely take decades.  Now as a restaurant or venue owner how does this affect  you? First you know how you obtain the right to publicly perform music for the public in your establishment, right?  From your ASCAP, BMI and SESAC licenses!  The very licenses the DOJ (apparently at the behest of Google)  has just obliterated. Currently these are blanket licenses. You don’t have to keep track of what songs the bands are playing and what songs the DJs are spinning. You don’t have to check the band's setlist before they go on stage or dig through the DJ's crate of albums and note which albums are not licensed and forbid DJs to play these songs. That is the beauty of the songwriter rights organizations. They create efficiency. It’s a win-win. Venues are shielded from infringement claims. Songwriters get paid.  Without these blanket licenses a bar, restaurant and venue would literally have to license each song directly from every music publisher and songwriter. Will it stay this way?  It is highly unlikely.  A significant number of songs will be unavailable for licensing and you will have to negotiate and obtain many more licenses from many more organizations to have the same coverage you have now. You may even be required to negotiate directly with an individual writer depending on the song. “Hi this is John from the Red Dog Saloon outside North Platte Nebraska. I’d like to talk to Max Martin about licensing that Taylor Swift Song” Above you can see what BMI wrote to the Judge Stanton who oversees BMI’s consent decree (the rule DOJ changed).  A significant portion of songs especially songs with foreign writers or cowriters, (and works with samples) become “stranded.”  Same thing would happen to ASCAP.  So because of the new DOJ rule, certain songs become “incapable of being performed in this country.”   Suddenly your BMI and ASCAP licenses are not “blanket licenses.” Don’t believe BMI?  What does the US Copyright Office say? The copyright office said the same thing last year when they warned against changing this rule.  See above.  “…might well result in a sharp decrease in repertoire available through these PRO’s blanket licenses.”  Now that we’ve seen the actual text of the DOJ rule we see the Copyright office was correct in its prediction. Even the Department of Justice admits in their own brief (above) that this new rule will require removing songs from BMI and ASCAP “blanket” licenses.   Further order that BMI and ASCAP identify the songs no longer allowed in the blanket licenses. The expenses associated with this Sisyphean task (new songs constantly created) will come out of songwriter royalties or higher licensing fees to venues. That’s right lower royalties, higher costs for venues and fewer songs available.  Doesn’t this violate the entire antitrust division mandate.  How many fewer songs available?  A shitload. Think about this for a minute. ASCAP and BMI are tasked with reviewing tens of millions of songs, contacting and getting responses from hundreds of thousands if not millions of songwriters, who then in turn need to review co-writer arrangements with co-writers and execute new agreements and get back to BMI and ASCAP. In one year.  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahaha Pure comedy gold. It seems reasonable to say that this is an impossible verification task and the resulting database of unlicenseable songs will be in the millions. Tons of work. Less songs. Massive inneficiency that benefits no one except Google (they can always rely on the DMCA safe harbor and let users upload unlicensable songs a bar can’t).  Guess what venue, restaurant and bar owners?  You’ve been fucked.   By your own public policy folks and Google through your membership in the MIC-Coalition.  “You see what happens when you find a stranger in the alps? ” Looks like restaurants, venues and bar owners WILL be asking bands and DJs which songs they will be playing and checking the setlist against some sort of database.    Oh and this pretty much makes your BMI/ASCAP/SESAC licenses considerably less valuable. They are no longer blanket assurances that you won’t get sued by some gold digging lawyer with a few song copyrights.   And with millions of “stranded” songs floating around it’s inevitable. But you’ll still be paying for your PRO licenses. Because some significant portion of the songs will still be in BMI and ASCAP.  And the DOJ went along with this idiotic rule. Despite the fact the US Copyright office warned them this would happen.  This is completely batshit crazy.   This is one of the most powerful departments of the US government Staffed with lawyers from elite institutions like Yale, Harvard and Berkeley.  (Hmm maybe that’s the problem!).  How did they fuck things up this bad.  I mean shouldn’t these people be fired? At least investigated for corruption? Sadly corruption or lose-your-law-license incompetence are the two most plausible explanations.  My bet is on corruption.  I mean doesn’t it seem a more than a little odd that this rule benefits no one but Google and it was pushed through by a DOJ official that used to work for Google? Yet looks like the public policy folks that should be looking out for the interests of bar, restaurant and venue owners are applauding this decision.  Apparently they were  too lazy to read the actual rule. Or too stoopid to understand the implications clearly spelled out.  Look what theABL president says: “ABL also welcomes DOJ’s confirmation of ‘full-work’ licensing, which means that the blanket licenses offered by Performing Rights Organization’s (PRO’s) provide licensees with the right to use all the works in that PRO’s repertoire without risk of copyright infringement.” Either he is conveniently leaving out the fact that potentially millions of songs will be removed from those blanket licenses.  Or he doesn’t understand what he is celebrating. Before all of this venue owners were pretty much insulated from random copyright infringement with the blanket licenses.  Now by the admission of the DOJ they won’t. Songs will be removed from those repertoires!!! Stoopid.  Restaurant and venue owners should ask their public policy folks exactly why they supported a rule that clearly will make licensing music less efficient,more expensive or even impossible?   If they can’t give you a straight answer?   Fire their asses as well. BTW the solution is incredibly simple.  Withdraw the rule. Continue with the old system of fractional licensing. It  was working just fine. And in the previous 80 years no one objected.  Related articles Music Publishing News Roundup: Jay-Z Introduces Tidal, ASCAP Day @Berklee College & More Irving Azoff Threatens To Pull 20K Songs Off YouTube 5 Things Songwriters Must Know About Consent Decrees Music Creators Send Dept.

By Liam Tung | August 10, 2016 -- 12:45 GMT (05:45 PDT) | Topic: Virtual Reality In one embodiment of Google's smartphone-based telepresence drone, a screen dangles off the front while a projector perches at the rear. Image: Google Many drones come with cameras, but Google thinks a drone with a projector could be the answer to mobile telepresence conferencing. This is how Google drones will deliver your packages, and keep your pets safe Drones could be a threat to pets and powerlines, so Google has come up with a new robot to help. Read More Google detailed its ideas for mobile telepresence in a patent granted this week by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for an "unmanned aerial vehicle for collaboration". Telepresence systems of the type sold by HP, Cisco, and Polycom may offer a more realistic virtual meeting space, but as Google notes, the right equipment needs to be at both ends, usually at a fixed location. Google thinks it can get around this problem with the help of drones equipped with everything that a telepresence system features, including cameras, microphones, projectors, speakers, and a display. The company notes that a remotely-controlled robot can deliver a mobile telepresence experience but argues that robots can't, for example, climb stairs: they're clumsy and energy-guzzlers. However, its unmanned quadcopter however could provide "significant improvements" in speed, maneuverability, energy consumption, and facilitate access to cramped spaces. For stability reasons, Google's quadcopter design is shaped like the letter H with a propeller at the ends of each of the longer strokes. In one embodiment, a screen dangles off the front end of the drone while a projector, not unlike the mini one found in Glass devices, perches at the rear of the vehicle. Google describes the display area of the screen as being "semi-translucent" so that images projected from the rear can be viewed from the front-facing surface of the screen. The patent doesn't go into much detail about how communications would be delivered, but notes that a docking station located on the top of the vehicle could house a smartphone, delivering processing and controls for the vehicle, as well as the audio/video capture and output. Google outlines that "the smartphone may receive images from the user at the remote location, and may project the received images through a projector included with the smartphone". That setup could use two mirrors where one bounces an image from the phone to a screen, and a second is used to capture an image from a room and reflect that to the camera of a smartphone. While there aren't many phones with built-in projectors, Lenovo, which made the first Google Tango smartphone, did unveil its concept Smart Cast phone, which featured a projector. Samsung has also released two Beam phones with projectors. Google has a number of configurations for the flying telepresence unit, including one that has no screen, but rather relies on an onboard projector to cast images onto an available wall.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe 3 min read Apps How to Drive App Discovery and Engagement Image credit: Betsie Van der Meer | Getty Images Max McCoy From Bizness Apps Contributor Startups 7 Roles Every Startup Founder Must Learn to Play Marketing Bootcamp 6 Common Problems for Marketing Agencies and How to Fix Them Mobile Apps 12 Apps to Help Ease Anxiety ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 10, 2016 This story originally appeared on Bizness Apps “I made my app, but where are all my customers?!” As consumers look to mobile apps for the majority of their product and service needs, it’s more crucial than ever for businesses to capitalize on this market. Creating your business application is a great first step, but having customers download and return to your app is a whole other battle. Proper marketing is what sets your app apart from your competitors, ensuring top customer acquisition and retention. Check out some of the most important tactics that successful marketers are using to drive app discovery and engagement through Google. Organic search When you’re just getting started, it’s important your business allocates its budget as efficiently as possible. Utilizing natural --or unpaid -- Google search results through app indexing can make your app easily discoverable. App indexing allows you to attract potential users through Google search, matching what customers search with your app’s relative content. Basic SEO strategy can be used to ensure your app ranks well in Google’s natural search results, allowing you to boost app downloads at little to no cost. Paid search Google play store ads Reach billions of Android users with ads that appear within the Google Play Store’s search results. You can now manage your app’s ads like you do traditional text ads with keywords and bids. Google also offers tools to track metrics, such as app installations. Mobile app install ads It’s a new world. There are now more Google searches on mobile than desktops. Search engines allow you to capitalize on this volume of traffic with paid search results. Much like organic search, mobile app install ads can be customized to particular searches to drive downloads to your app. Google is also looking to launch “streamable” apps that allow users to test them out before downloading, which would increase the importance of app indexing & paid mobile engagement ads. Re-engaging customers Ensuring that customer returns to your app is extremely important and equally difficult. A year ago, nearly 20% of apps were abandoned after their first use. Although this number is likely to decline, it is crucial to build a retention strategy that sets your app up for success. Deep linking is an extremely effective re-engagement strategy. Proper app indexing strategies will allow users to return to your app directly from the Google search results page. You can deep link searches into an already installed app and continue to market it just as you would before the user downloaded. This helps ensure your users return frequently. Be sure to keep up with your app’s push notifications too. An effective push notification strategy is a simple way to re-engage app users and improve retention rates. Your mobile app presence is absolutely necessary in today’s world. Be sure to leverage your app’s potential.   More from Bizness Apps How Teachers Can Leverage Mobile in the Classroom Everything You Need to Know About Apple’s App Store Improvements How To Make Money By Selling Mobile Apps To Small Businesses Mobile Apps Technology Apps Engagement Company Advertise Brand Licensing Contact Us Staff Contribute Upcoming Events Entrepreneur 360™ Livestream Growth Strategies On-Demand Event Products Business Books Reprints & Licensing Classifieds Entrepreneur Lending Entrepreneur Coaching Editions United States Middle East India Español Philippines South Africa China Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Flickr Tumblr RSS Feedly Subscribe Now Gift Subscriptions Subscriber Services Digital Editions iOSAndroidKindle Copyright © 2016 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

The updates are rolling out to the Web interface and mobile apps. With the update to Inbox by Gmail, you will get a summary of all the latest changes on your projects from the project management application Trello projects, as well as summary of code changes and filed issues for each repository in case from the software collaboration platform GitHub, inside the email client. These improvements to email notifications will not be limited to just Trello and GitHub, Google said in a blog post, and the search giant is asking other companies that send regular emails to their users to contact it for a future integration. Inbox by Gmail has not got an improved way to view Google Alerts, allowing users to browse through them as they would with a newsletter. All the new alerts are summarised and you can either choose to read more or mark them as done.Google has also added several other features to Inbox by Gmail with the update, features that were requested through user feedback. These features include the capability to insert Google Drive links into emails, checking and fixing permissions for these links, and ability to save email attachments to Drive, as mentioned by the search giant in its blog. With the Inbox by Gmail update, you also get the ability to drag-and-drop contacts between To, Cc, and Bcc in compose section of the Web interface. Further, you can now delete emails right from the inbox.In April, the email client was updated to add 'Save to Inbox' feature that worked just like the Pocket app where you get the ability to save web links to articles or other content that you might want to revisit later.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Internet Google Chrome is officially killing Flash in favor of HTML5 Internet Google Chrome is officially killing Flash in favor of HTML5 By Bindu Nair - Google Chrome is ditching Flash in favor of HTML5 starting from September this year, in line with an earlier announcement it had made in May to cut off ties with the former. The search giant announced the news in a blog post, explaining its reasoning for the move. According to Google’s research, more than 90% of Flash online loads behind the scenes to support components like page analytics. The company claims that this kind of Flash slows down users considerably. In order to combat the lag, it plans to block Adobe Flash Player in Chrome 53 starting from September. This will eventually escalate in Google Chrome version 55 in December which will make HTML5 the default experience. The company has been planning this transition for quite a while now. For instance, some Flash content was transformed into click-to-play back in September last year. Also Read: Google is developing a VR version of Chrome This decision apparently had an immediate positive impact among Chrome consumers by reducing page load times and battery power consumed. The eventual shift towards HTML5 is meant to further this agenda. Google asserts that the platform is lighter and faster, with clearly noticeable improvements in responsiveness and efficiency across a number of websites. Of course, quite a few sites only support Flash. Chrome is making an exception for such pages. Anyone who visits these websites will be prompted to enable Flash when they first open it. Google went on to acknowledge the contributions Flash made towards shaping the Web and crafting the modern set of web standards. Google plans to continue working closely with Adobe during this transition towards HTML5. A number of other browsers such as Firefox, Safari and Edge are looking to switch to the latter as well.

The new Moto Z Force Droid Edition also focuses on a modular design, but after using a few of them for a week I am already convinced that Motorola's implementation is better. What's Hot on ZDNet #WeAreNotWaiting: Diabetics are hacking their health, because traditional systems have failed them Microsoft's SQL Server Next: What's under the covers The cloud price war continues: Amazon cuts its cloud storage prices, again VMware turns to sci-fi writers to explain virtualization Motorola launched the Moto X back in 2013 and its small form factor, enhanced gesture controls, pure Android experience, and customization options made it one of my favorite devices I still own today. I haven't been this excited about a Motorola phone since that original Moto X. After checking out the new Moto G4 and G4 Plus, solid devices available at low prices, I was expecting the same rather ordinary design in the Moto Z Force Droid Edition. It turns out that the new Moto Z Force is well constructed, has a unique approach to mods, contains a great camera, and is a phone I can recommend to smartphone buyers. Specifications Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 2.2 GHz quad-core Display: 5.5 inch 2560x1440 pixels resolution AMOLED ShatterShield display Operating system: Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow RAM: 4GB Storage: 32GB internal (64GB option available) with microSD expansion card slot Cameras: Rear 21 megapixel f/1.8 aperture with 1.12um pixel and front 5 megapixel f/2.2 aperture with 1.4um pixel Water resistance: Water repelleant nano-coating Battery: 3500 mAh non-removable with TurboPower fast charging technology Dimensions: 155.9 x 75.8 x 6.99 mm and 163 grams The Moto Z Force Droid incorporates the same specs found in other high end Android smartphones with the addition of a rugged display that should handle typical accidental drops. It's the first Android phone without a headphone jack, but Motorola did include a USB Type-C to 3.5mm dongle in the box. I use a pair of wired Bose noise-cancelling headphones when I travel so I am personally not ready to give up on the headphone jack. It would be nice to see the Moto Z Force launch with Android Nougat, but hopefully we see it updated before the end of the year after Google rolls out the OS and new Nexus devices. Hardware The Moto Z Force is a rather large device with a 5.5 inch display and rather wide bezels, when compared to other modern Android smartphones. There is a tall bezel below the display where we find the word Moto and a fingerprint scanner. Just like the Moto G4 Plus, the fingerprint scanner only serves to unlock the phone or turn off the display. It does not serve as a home button or for any other function, which seems like a waste of space to me and is not what I prefer. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Unlike many other phones with 2.5D curved glass, there are defined edges around the front display of the Moto Z Force with the glass butting up to the metal edges. There is one speaker on the Moto Z Force, found above the display in the handset speaker. HTC does this with the HTC 10, but HTC also has another speaker down at the bottom. Volume is decent on the Moto Z Force, but Moto did a better job with stereo speakers on previous Motorola phones. The display looks fantastic and the fact that it is shatterproof is a major benefit to owning the Moto Z Force. Field workers will appreciate having a phone they can drop without having to worry about breaking screens as they get work done. A USB Type-C port is found at the bottom and a Turbo Charger is included in the box. Motorola reports that you can get up to 15 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging. Battery life of the 3,500 battery is rated at up to 40 hours. I've experienced great battery life over the past week and am easily going for more than a day every single day. The camera performs well in most conditions and includes OIS and laser autofocus. I often see the "hold camera steady" notice while taking photos so it isn't as quick to capture pictures as the Samsung Galaxy phones. Moto Mods LG brought us modularity through attachments that slide up and into the LG G5 through the bottom. This meant that the phone had to be shut down and restarted whenever a new module was attached. This also meant that the module had to incorporate a battery to replace the one slid out of the bottom. The only modules we have seen for the LG G5 were the LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O Play that added a DAC and headphone jack and the LG Cam Plus that added physical camera keys and about doubled the thickness of the LG G5. You could also replace the battery with a spare. That's all there was to the LG G5, which did nothing to sell the power of modularity. With the new Motorola Z and Z Force, Motorola is launching with the JBL SoundBoost speaker, Incipio offGRID Power Pack, and Moto Insta-Share Projector. There are also various back cover designs that attach to the magnetic back of the Moto Z and Z Force to quickly give your phone a different look. These three main mods are more compelling than what LG launched with, but hopefully we will continue to see more launch in the coming months. I was sent the speaker and projector to check out for a couple of weeks. The Moto Insta-Share Projector module is available for $299.99. The 125 gram attachment snaps on the back to project up to 70 inches on a screen or wall in front of you. The projector has a resolution of 854x480 with a brightness of 50 lumens and a lamp life of 10,000 hours. An 1100 mAh battery is also included to provide up to 60 minutes of projection time with a USB Type-C port for charging up the module. After attaching the mod to the back, you simply press and hold on the power button to turn on the projector. There is also a dial to focus the picture at your desired distance with the bottom of the mod serving as a stand to hold your phone at any angle from zero to 180 degrees. I put Star Wars: The Force Awakens on the Moto Z Force Droid and was pleasantly surprised by the resolution and quality of the projector. I then loaded up an Excel spreadsheet and a PowerPoint presentation to view those on a white board. While this accessory is expensive, it could serve sales and marketing teams well on the road. Imagine only having to pack along this mod in the included draw-string bag to give your next presentation. While many of us typically use headphones to enjoy music, people also like to share videos they capture and YouTube videos with others. There is also a large market for Bluetooth speakers that go to the beach, outside for summer parties, and wherever you want to enjoy music with others. The JBL SoundBoost speaker snaps on the back of your Moto Z phone and provides 6W of speaker power, 1000 mAh of battery power for 10 hours of music, an integrated kickstand, and speakerphone functionality. The USB Type-C port is found on the front of the JBL SoundBoost so you need to charge it up before attaching it to your Moto Z Force. It sounds good and can take the place of an external portable speaker for some situations. Moto Z Force Droid Edition image and screenshot... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 24 NEXT PREV Software Like all modern Motorola Android phones, you will find a very pure Google experience on the Moto Z Force. I installed the Google launcher because I like to have the Google Now home screen panel on my phones. The quick controls, app drawer, and settings are all stock Android fare. The Moto Z Force Droid launches with Android Marshmallow and the May 2016 Android security patch. Motorola stated it will issue an update soon after the release of the Z Force, but it will not commit to timely monthly updates as we have seen from Samsung and Google. Everything runs smoothly on the Moto Z Force Droid and all has been stable as well. I personally like some of the customizations and enhancements offered by phone makers, but purists will enjoy using the Moto Z Force. Motorola has always offered some cool enhancements and gestures that I am pleased to see continue here on the Moto Z Force Droid. To view and change the default for these enhancements, launch the Moto app on the phone. Enhancements include the twist to launch the camera, chop motion to turn on the flashlight (extremely handy when I go to be late each night), reach to trigger Moto Display, flip to enable do not disturb, pick up to stop ringing, customized Google Now voice command support, and more. I am not a Verizon customer and am used to devices with very little extra software. Verizon went to town on this device and includes VZ Protect, VZ Navigator, Verizon Voice Mail, Slacker Radio, Slotomania, NFL Mobile, Message+, Juice Jam, go90, Genies and Gems, Game of War, Cookie Jam, Cloud, Caller Name ID, Audible, Amazon Kindle, and My Verizon. Apple gets away from having to install all of this bloatware on the iPhone and I hope someday that Android manufacturers will be able to offer phones without these apps. It's fine to have a carrier section of the app store to install apps if the customer wants the app, but it's a shame that carriers can consume internal storage with its preferences. Pricing and competition There are plenty of great Android smartphone options available today for $400 or less. Devices like the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy need to offer unique compelling features to justify the $700 to $900+ selling price. The Moto Z Force Droid starts at $720 with $50 more for 64GB of internal storage. Swappable backs start at $19.99 with Moto Mods priced from $59.99 to $299.99. Check out the CNET review where the Moto Z Force Droid earned 8.2/10 stars. While the Moto Z Force Droid has a premium price, it does offer a shatterproof display, cool Moto gestures and functions, long battery life, and unique expansion capability. The Moto Z and Moto Z Force Droid phones are currently limited to the Verizon network. I switched carriers in the past to gain access to a specific phone and could justify switching to Verizon for the Moto Z Droid Force. However, the phone will eventually be offered as an unlocked model that will be free of the carrier crap so I'll wait to see when that launches. Daily usage experiences and conclusion I had no real expectations for the Moto Z Force Droid so was pleasantly surprised by the rock solid design, camera performance, and interesting approach to modularity. It's a rather big and heavy phone, especially when a Moto Mod is slapped on the back. The Moto Z Droid is thinner and lighter than the Z Force Droid, but it loses the shatterproof display and the camera drops down to a 13 megapixel shooter. The battery on the Moto Z is also quite a bit smaller at 2,600 mAh. If I was going to buy one of these new Verizon Droid phones, I would pay the extra $96 to get the improvemens in the display, camera, and battery. With phones like the Moto G4 Plus offering a similar form factor and core experiences, it can be tough to justify paying three times the cost for the Moto Z Force.

So if you go into your settings for your remarketing search campaign and click on networks, you now have the option to include "search partners." Google said "search partners extend the reach of search ads to hundreds of non-Google websites, as well as Google Video and other Google websites. This change means your audience-targeted bids, keywords, and ads will reach more of your potential customers without any additional work." Here is a screen shot of that setting: Forum discussion at Google+.

The new features include the ability to see how people viewed your lists, i.e. from Google Search or from Google Maps. Also, you can see if they searched directly for your business, i.e. by searching for your business name, address or phone or if they searched by discovery, i.e. by category, product or service. Personally, I still see the old reports in my account, so I assume it is rolling out slowly. Google said "not only will you see the total number of views for your listing, you’ll also see a breakdown of how many are coming from Google Search vs. Maps." Notice, Google removed Google+ data. You can see who visited your listing after searching for it directly, and who discovered your business while looking for a broader category. Forum discussion at Twitter.

The popular navigation app also has a new option to select a Wifi Only mode – potentially saving a fortune in mobile data charges when you go abroad. Alamy 2 Google Maps has unveiled new features in its latest version for Android phones The Wifi Only mode on the Android app limits the app to offline files when connected to 3G or 4G. It replaces Offline Areas in the Settings menu. When selected Google Maps will never use any mobile data – even when you are outside an area downloaded and saved to your device. Instead it will only connect to the internet to load any missing parts of the map when you are connected to a wifi network. Previously with the Offline Areas mode, Google Maps would stop using pre-loaded maps as soon as it got a mobile signal. It meant users might not realise the phone was downloading huge amounts of data through the mobile network.

Google reveals plans to put 'eyes in machines' as digital surveillance fears reach boiling point road rage Google to unleash 'super-powered' traffic wardens which could bring motoring misery to millions The new mode could also save battery life, experts say – crucial when you need to find your way but the power bar is in the red zone. Google announced the new addition on its official blog. It said: “We’ve all been through this – whether in our own backyard or a different country. “You need to get directions, but you don’t have service. Or you do have service – but it’s spotty – so you find yourself staring at the map in a perpetual state of loading while you sit in your car waiting to find out which way to go. “Now, when you know you’ll have spotty service or just want to save on data, you can toggle to ‘Wi-fi only’ to use Google Maps entirely offline on Android. “And the best part is that you can still use other apps and the rest of your phone as you normally would. You might even save on battery life too.” Alamy 2 Google Maps users can now save maps on a memory card and choose a Wifi-Only option to save data and battery life The other major change to the Android version of the app is the ability to save maps and directions to external storage such as a microSD card. It promises to dramatically improve navigating in areas without good mobile coverage – as long as you download the map before you set off. Google will let users choose between internal and external storage before a map is saved for offline viewing. Another update improves Google Maps integration with taxi apps in several countries in Europe and Asia. It should let users compare prices of a number of services at once. Amanda Bishop of Google Maps said: “Commuting around your own city can be a battle and navigating around a foreign land can be ten times tougher. “Using Google Maps offline and comparing between ride service options help make it a little easier so you can spend more time living and less time figuring out how to get places.”   Topics Google Google Maps Holidays Mobile Phone Smartphones Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Read in News SO WHO IS SHE?

Google is on a roll, by making a ton of Olympic 2016 content available for people across the globe, and now they’ve introduced some exclusive features to Google Trends. Google has created a Google Trends Olympic Hub where users can find fun facts, data insights, feature pages on sports and athletes, and more. Throughout the next few weeks, Google Trends will give its users a unique view into the games with a new Trends Hub just for the Olympics. There, you’ll be able to see which athletes, events and moments are captivating audiences and searches worldwide. Google Trends will deliver Search insights revealing what the world is wondering about the events—from fencing to synchronized swimming (and every moment in between!) It’ll also show data interactives like Google’s alternative medal table and top searched sports per country. It’ll also display trending sports and athletes lists, showing what’s of interest at any given moment Google has also introduced an all-new Google Trends Explore page. With a fresh design and features like a color-coded map, users can analyze search data in new ways. For example, you can compare interest in previous Olympic Games over the years. Google has taken the street view to the slums of Rio, and now people thousands of miles away too can experience the real Rio, getting closer to the overall experience, making it more engrossing. The street views goes deep into various favelas in the city, with colorful houses in the horizon. Google had also improved Google Now cards notifying users of their favorite games, and scores. Users can discover the event schedule, medal counts, and athlete information in Google’s Search app. Google is also featuring official broadcasters’ event highlights on YouTube in 60+ countries. Google also released the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games which is Olympic games, but fruit-style. You’ll find fruits participating against each other. Every week the Google Doodle gets a new game which users on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store can enjoy. Computer and Product ...

She also revealed that Google paid $1 billion to be the default search bar on Apple's iPhone. Those figures should have stayed confidential, say Google lawyers, but once a Bloomberg reporter got hold of a transcript of the hearing, they became headline news. Yesterday, Oracle filed court papers (PDF) responding to the accusations. Oracle points out that Hurst's statements were made "in response to probing questions from Magistrate Judge Ryu," and were an "on-the-fly rebuttal of mischaracterizations made by Google's counsel." The statements didn't violate the protective order, Oracle argues, and they fall short of the legal requirements for contempt. "Sanctions... require 'extreme circumstances' and a level of bad faith and willfulness that is not present here," states Oracle in its response. The statements came up during a January 14 hearing over discovery issues, in which Oracle was trying to compel Google to hand over more data, including revenue share data. Google lawyer Robert Van Nest said that the information had already been provided in a deposition. Hurst pulled up the relevant transcript on a laptop in court and sought to explain to the judge that the witness in question "had limited his testimony to what the Google revenue-share percentage with Apple had been 'at one point in time.'" "It was not effective or appropriate to argue about who was right about the contents of the deposition transcript when it could be readily verified," Oracle lawyers explain in their brief. "Ms. Hurst read the transcript to the Court in the heat of an argument to put to rest the dispute about the deposition and did not think to censor her response." A decision on the matter is still at least several weeks away. Google has 10 days to respond to the just-filed brief, and the companies are scheduled to argue the matter in court on September 22. The statements from the January 14 hearing weren't immediately reported. A transcript was made public on January 20, and Google quickly asked to redact and seal the transcript. It was removed from public view on the afternoon of January 21—a few hours after Bloomberg News published a story based on its contents. Google is requesting attorneys' fees and costs required to produce its motion for contempt as well as the filings "that were necessary to reclaim protection of the confidential information." Its brief cites eight motions in all for which it wants to be reimbursed. The company also "leaves to the Court consideration of other remedies or relief that may be appropriate given the current status of this action."

News Technology Google embroiled in Palestine 'airbrush' maps row Mark Chandler Wednesday 10 August 2016 12:06 BST Row: Palestine has never been shown on Google Maps Google Maps Google has denied Palestine ever appeared on its maps after claims the state had been “airbrushed” from the service. The search engine giant said this week there had never been a label for the country on its maps, despite it being recognised by 136 UN members as an independent state. Instead of the solid lines that mark out a country, Google uses a dashed border around the West Bank and Gaza Strip to show them as disputed territories. But a glitch this week caused the labels for both territories to disappear from the service, leading to a furious online reaction using the hashtag #PalestineIsHere. #PalestineIsHere Where is my palestine?Why i can't find it in your map? pic.twitter.com/ZOkxZ6o12T — Tügva Amasya (@tugvaamasya) August 10, 2016 Read more Google worker Vanessa Marcotte's father speaks out after daughter found dead and stripped naked in woods London pro-Palestine demo sees thousands take to the streets Pro-Palestine Tube posters 'an act of vandalism' "You can change the map Google but you can't change the reality," read one response which was typical of the criticism. But the company says that there has never been a 'Palestine' label on Google Maps. Google employees discovered a bug that removed the labels for 'West Bank' and 'Gaza Strip', it has been claimed. The company is said to be working quickly to get the labels back to the area. This week's internet anger followed a petition from March this year signed by more than 250,000 people calling for Palestine to be shown as a separate country to Israel on Maps. They claimed the company had “airbrushed” Palestine out and accused it of “aiding and abetting” Israel.

(Google) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Images 02 1/ 02 Video Audio Google claims a 'bug' removed the terms 'West Bank' and 'Gaza Strip' amid tensions over the tech giant's refusal to acknowledge Palestine's sovereignty. Source: SBS News 10 Aug 2016 - 9:29 PM  UPDATED 11 Aug 2016 - 5:05 PM Tweet Google admitted to online technology magazine 'Engadget' this week that it had accidentally omitted the labels ‘West Bank’ and ‘Gaza Strip’ from its map service. “We discovered a bug that removed the labels for 'West Bank' and 'Gaza Strip'," a spokesperson said. "We're working quickly to bring these labels back to the area."  While it has since restored 'Gaza', the area of West Bank is marked only by a red line. But the apparent glitch led a Gaza-based journalism group to believe that Google had in fact erased the territory of Palestine from Google Maps, which prompted an outcry on social media under the hashtag #Palestineishere. “The Forum of Palestinian Journalists condemns the crime carried out by Google in deleting the name of Palestine, and calls for Google to rescind its decision and apologize to the Palestinian people,” the organisation stated on its website. Shame on you @google !

Google's failure to acknowledge Palestine's sovereignty in line with the UN has prompted hundreds of thousands of people to sign a Change.org petition, which began five months ago to call for Google to recognise Palestine on Google Maps. “The omission of Palestine is a grievous insult to the people of Palestine and undermines the efforts of the millions of people who are involved in the campaign to secure Palestinian independence and freedom from Israeli occupation and oppression,” the petition reads.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 23, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports As Google AMP appears in organic mobile results, some see lower CTRs Mobile More News 10 Aug 16 | Al Roberts Facebook54 Linkedin113 Google+26 Twitter 193 Last week, Google announced that Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) are making their way into the organic mobile SERPs. While AMP is not a ranking signal, at least not yet, this announcement is a milestone for the initiative that Google launched earlier this year in an effort to speed up the mobile web. The search giant’s desire to make mobile web pages load faster is obvious: slow, clunky pages that don’t provide a good user experience threaten Google’s mobile ad business. AMP, which is an open standard that consists of slimmed-down HTML and JavaScript, aims to make it possible for publishers to more easily create performant mobile experiences. But for all of AMP’s virtues, websites that have adopted AMP may not be benefiting from the introduction of their AMP pages into Google’s organic mobile search results. In fact, they could be seeing less traffic. As Barry Schwartz of Search Engine Roundtable detailed, he’s seen a lower CTR from AMP pages. Glenn Gabe of G-Squared Interactive speculates that lower CTRs for AMP results could be due to the fact that users don’t know what AMP is, making the AMP icon and text that appears alongside AMP results a CTR killer: “Looking back the demo and seeing both AMP icons + mobile-friendly tags, I couldn’t help but think that the average user might understand mobile-friendly way more than AMP with a lightning bolt. And if that’s the case, wouldn’t that yield mediocre results for amplified pages in the search results (at least in the short-term)? And couldn’t that possibly lead to even more click through to mobile-friendly pages versus amplified pages?” Share this article Facebook54 Linkedin113 Google+26 Twitter 193 Related articles Google adds real-time data to its Popular Times tool in Search and Maps Google releases new AdWords improvements and stats ahead of Black Friday How marketing will change when 5G and VR collide Five most important search marketing news stories of the week In an effort to test this hypothesis, Gabe created a quick poll that asked respondents if they knew what AMP referred to, and whether they’re be more likely to click on an “AMP” or “mobile-friendly” search result. Not so surprisingly, only three of the 44 people who responded to the poll knew what AMP was, and only two indicated they’d be more likely to click on an “AMP” result compared to 29 who preferred “mobile-friendly.” While a poll of 44 people is far from scientific, Gabe’s logic – that average consumers who aren’t involved with web development and SEO aren’t likely to know what AMP is – seems sound and raises questions about how Google will educate the public about what AMP is and what benefits it offers. The good news is that Google is almost certainly collecting data about its new AMP results and is likely to take action if it notices lower CTRs across the board for these results. In the meantime, early AMP adopters experiencing lower CTRs have a not so pleasant reminder that being an early adopter can sometimes be a double-edged sword.

Powerful Android Adware Makes Its Way Into the Google Play Store GO Apps are still available for download at the time of writing Aug 10, 2016 11:17 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Six apps from a developer named ValerySoftware have found their way into the official Google Play Store and have infected at least 3,000 users, based on their current download counts. The apps, discovered and reported this week by Intel McAfee security experts, are nothing more but hollow shells providing no functionality at all, except for the malicious features. Apps specialized in showing ads, downloading & installing other apps Advertised as all sorts of Minecraft mods, the apps are capable of collecting sensitive information from the phone, downloading Android apps from external sources or the Google Play Store. The malicious apps can also install the previously downloaded apps, uninstall them, and open or close applications on demand, based on commands received from a central command server. Additionally, the malicious app will use advertising SDKs to load and show ads from various vendors, silently tapping the ads behind the scenes. All apps ask users for administrator rights All of this is possible because the apps require administrator rights at installation time. Since the apps are installed from the Google Play Store, users are generally willing to grant them such powers, even if the underlying app is only a silly game mod and doesn't have a reason to require admin privileges. The reason for requiring admin-level access is to make it much harder to remove the apps after they were installed, something that most users providing feedback on the apps' Google Play pages have complained about. "I tried for mabye a month and still won't delete," wrote user Denise Travis. "I hate it and it won't work or delete," said Xavier Martinez. Apps have ties to a well-known cyber-criminal group from Europe Intel McAfee experts noticed that all apps were encrypted and obfuscated at many levels, which might explain why Google didn't detect their malicious behavior during the automated security tests it performs before approving the apps on the Play Store. For its part, Intel McAfee has noticed that the app uses domain names previously associated with other cyber-criminal activity, meaning the apps are part of a well-oiled cyber-crime syndicate. "Based in the domain owner’s information in this malware, we can tie the authors to a group of known cybercriminals in Europe who host and distribute malware," experts wrote. At the time of writing, all malicious ValerySoftware apps reported by Intel McAfee are still available for download. Intel McAfee detects these threats as Android/Agent.FL.

That's certainly an issue that the whole world can nod their heads to in unison and it seems tech giant Google might be preparing a solution for the same. Going by the beta versions, the next update from Google Maps could tell you where to park your car. The Google Maps 9.34 update will include this as a feature and will tell the use where free parking spots are available. As a result, you will need to just drive your car to the location and save you a lot of effort, time and fuel in the process. The feature is yet to be made public and was found in the beta version that is out for initial testing. While this certainly feels like a dream come true for motorists, it isn't clear yet how the company plans to accumulate data with respect to finding free parking spots. The teardown from the application package shows that there are three categories for parking - easy, medium and hard. This could likely mean that the feature would let you know on the generic availability of parking space in a particular area. The map could guide you to the nearest pay and park or free parking zone. A live update on available parking spots at 'pay and park' outlets would be an interesting addition. That said, it needs to be clarified if the feature will be based on time of the day or specific events.

Aug 10th 2016, 12:18 PM 10,005 Views 13 Comments Share2 Tweet Email1 Definitely not unsettling. Nope. Image: Google VR/YouTube AFTER YEARS OF disappointment and false promises, we’ve reached the point where virtual reality (VR) is now not only possible but accessible thanks to smartphones now doubling up as VR displays. One of the companies working on their own platform is Google’s DayDream Labs, which announced its VR platform back in May, and it’s has been experimenting with different ways of preventing harassment and encouraging good behaviour in virtual spaces. While VR can be used to help people suffering from PTSD or depression, the inverse can also be true. The same things you can physically do to make someone feel uncomfortable or harassed, like walking up to someone and standing up against them, apply in VR (and that’s just a mild example) Source: Google VR/YouTube Even though you know you’re in a virtual world, your senses still treat it like the real thing. It’s the same reason why you react when you accidentally walk into a virtual table or try to lean on it. In one of the examples, it showed a poker game played by floating dog heads. The idea was that if someone weren’t happy with the result and tried confronting the other player, the platform would recognise this and turn the screen grey to disorient them. They also disappear and are unable to interact with the space until they return to their original position. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=BoOVVx9CnL8&t=) Source: Google VR/YouTube At the same time, it also looked at ways to encourage users to perform positive actions like high-fives by using fireworks animations and haptic feedback like the controller vibrating to reward it. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=F24l39rkMxI&t=) Source: Google VR/YouTube The reason for that is because Google found that when you place people into a virtual room, one of the first things they’ll do is look for ways to physically interact with each other. As more smartphone makers start bringing out VR headsets to compliment them – Google’s DayDream is a platform which is designed to do just that – more people will be in possession of devices which allow for such experiences.

Users can expect faster page loading times, better security and reduced battery consumption.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Google's plans of blocking Flash on Chrome are about to kick off in version 53, ending things with version 55 by placing HTML5 as the default by then. When September arrives, the browser will receive the update and "de-emphasize Flash in favor of HTML5," and on that day moving forward, the Mountain View-based company says that it should load up pages faster, minimize battery consumption and even keep users more secured on the internet. This goes without saying, but the reason why things will start improving is because HTML5 is significantly lighter in terms of using resources than Flash. Google even points out that more than 90 percent of Flash online load in the background to support various features such as analytics and slow down the whole browsing experience. As mentioned earlier, the changes will get off the ground in September with Chrome 53, and aligning with reports that said Chrome will block Flash by the end of 2016, the major update will take place in December. "In December, Chrome 55 will make HTML5 the default experience, except for sites which only support Flash. For those, you'll be prompted to enable Flash when you first visit the site," Anthony LaForge, curator of Flash in Chrome, says. It should also be cleared up that other than the improvements across the board, Chrome users probably won't notice any changes with how they browse online when version 53 rolls out. Also, interestingly enough, Google already got rid of Flash ads last year and rendered some of them as click-to-play content a few months after with Chrome 42. Various websites and companies have been shunning Flash recently, describing it as a power-hungry plug-in that's also a security risk. As expected, a lot of them turned to HTML5 because it's basically better from any perspective. Long story short, Chrome users should see faster loading times, a more efficient battery usage and better security in general during their time online, especially on websites riddled with Flash. It's also safe to expect far fewer crashes in the foreseeable future — that is, if all pans out. What do you think of Google's latest move with Chrome? Hit us up in the comments section below and let us know what's on your mind. Personally, it's great to see that a lot of websites are starting to adapt HTML5 and that Google is doing away with the heavy plug-in.

Libby Plummer 10 Aug 2016 By Libby Plummer Wednesday 10 August 2016 Shutterstock / 360b Google Chrome is to start phasing out Adobe's Flash in favour of HTML5, which will be the default choice by December. ADVERTISEMENT The long goodbye is due to start in September, with the introduction of Google Chrome 53, which is currently in beta testing mode. "Today, more than 90 per cent of Flash on the web loads behind the scenes to support things like page analytics," explained Google curator of Flash in Chrome Anthony LaForge in a blog post. Read more EE just filled hundreds of 4G blackspots in the UK overnight EE just filled hundreds of 4G blackspots in the UK overnight By Victoria Woollaston "This kind of Flash slows you down, and starting this September, Chrome 53 will begin to block it. HTML5 is much lighter and faster, and publishers are switching over to speed up page loading and save you more battery life. You’ll see an improvement in responsiveness and efficiency for many sites." Google originally unveiled plans to block Flash by default back in May. By the time Chrome 55 lands in December, HTML5 will be the only option for Chrome users with exceptions made for sites that only support Flash. Chrome users visiting a Flash-based site will be prompted to turn it on for that particular page, while HTML5 will be the default. ADVERTISEMENT Users will only need to manually fire up the plugin the first time that they use a Flash site, after which Chrome will note the approval for future visits. Chrome is the latest browser to ditch Adobe's multimedia software, with Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Edge having already moved away from Flash.

Moving forward, the browser will “de-emphasize” Flash in favor of HTML5. The slow bandaid-pull starts in September with Chrome 53. Google’s reasoning for the switch is Flash is — well, Flash: Today, more than 90% of the Flash on the web loads behind the scenes to support things like page analytics. This kind of Flash slows you down, and starting this September, Chrome 53 will begin to block it. HTML5 is much lighter and faster, and publishers are switching over to speed up page loading and save you more battery life. You’ll see an improvement in responsiveness and efficiency for many sites. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat The slow murder of Flash won’t take long, though. By the time Chrome 55 hits in December, Google plans to have HTML5 as the only option for Chrome users — unless a site only supports Flash. If you visit a Flash site, Google will prompt you to turn it on for that page. HTML5 will always be the default. It’s not surprising; we’d been expecting this for some time, and Google is simply following Safari and Edge in moving away from Flash. Flash was good for its time, but it’s 2016 — good riddance to it.

This year, Google has opened up a special Trends Hub, in the Google Trends website, for the Rio Olympics. It aims to help fans keep a track on events and athletes. The new Trends Hub will provide more insights into what people are searching during the event. With more than 10,500 athletes from over 200 countries participating in 306 events, the Google Trends Olympics Hub will help you find "fun facts, data insights, feature pages on sports and athletes, and more." The Trends Hub for Olympics will let you see which athletes, events and moments are taking up the attention of audiences across the world. Worldwide search trends will indicate what people are searching about during the mega event. For example, India has been searching for boxing the most followed by Dipa Karmakar as the most trending Indian athlete. The search insights will reveal what the world is thinking about the events, while data insights will give you a peek into Google's alternative medal tally and top searched sports per country. The trending sports and athletes list will show what is piquing the interest of audiences at any given moment. There is also a new Trends Explore Page that offers an insight into search data from many perspectives. For example, you can compare interest in previous Olympic Games over the years. Google Trends is a web facility that show how often a particular word or a phrase has been searched in the company's own search engine in various languages. The popularity is broken down by countries, regions, cities and languages.

Where's palestine you damn israel's puppet! @google @googlemaps #PalestineIsHere — Valdi Greenwood (@ValdiArief) August 8, 2016 Disgusted by @google @googlemaps doing in a single keystroke what Israel couldn't in nearly 70 years #PalestineIsHere — Marc Heatley (@marcheatley) August 8, 2016 @googlemaps a geography lesson: #PalestineIsHere and exists.The 5 million palestinians in Gaza and West Bank are not in Israel #BDSMovement Related Stories Israel Bans All Palestinians After Attack, Army Says 2-State Mideast Solution Less Likely, French Official Says — Ferran (@ferrangom1973) August 8, 2016 However, it turns out Google never used the label to start with. A search for Palestine — or the West Bank and Gaza Strip — on Google Maps shows a demarcated area where it should be but does not mention it by name. The label of Israel is applied to regions outside the Palestinian areas. Clicking on cities within the Palestinian areas shows them as being in Palestine. Google Maps does not label Palestine as a country. Photo: Google Maps A Google spokesperson told Engadget: “There has never been a 'Palestine' label on Google Maps, however we discovered a bug that removed the labels for 'West Bank' and 'Gaza Strip.' We're working quickly to bring these labels back to the area.” The company’s explanation hasn’t stopped from #PalestineIsHere from trending on Twitter. A five-month-old petition on Change.org asking Google to put Palestine on its Maps has also gained traction the last few days, crossing 250,000 signatures. Many Palestinians and others feeling outraged have said they were switching away from using Google’s services. Microsoft, whose Bing Maps labels Palestine clearly as its own place, is likely to benefit. On the other hand, Apple, which doesn’t separate the region from Israel at all, will not.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Black Friday Deals Blu-ray Players DVRs and Media players Gadgets Headphones Portable Audio Projectors More Surround Sound Systems TVs Trending: Black Friday Deals Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / TV News / Bang & Olufsen unveils new Android TV-powered 4K Beovision 14 Bang & Olufsen unveils new Android TV-powered 4K Beovision 14 by Joe Roberts 10 August 2016 0 shares Read Comments Bang & Olufsen has taken the wraps of its first TV for some years and introduced the new Beovision 14. The new set comes with a 4K resolution and is powered by Google's TV OS Android TV, so it should play nice with Google Cast. There's also an anti-reflection coating on the glass which the company says will reduce reflections by up to 98%, and 360-degree Automatic Picture Control adjusts images based on the ambient light in the room. What's more, the Beovision 14 can be attached to a motorised stand which will allow you to turn the TV in your direction using the remote control. And for the audiophiles, B&O has included the same tech used in its BeoLab 18 loudspeaker in the three-way custom speaker on the front of the TV. Related: What is Ultra HD Premium? Unfortunately, the Beovision 14 is missing some of the more recent TV tech – namely HDR. While you'll get an Ultra HD picture then, the set won't be able to display films and TV shows mastered for High Dynamic Range. Which is a shame, as the technology is set to be the next big thing for TVs. Simply put, it produces a much wider range of colours, brighter whites, and darker blacks while preserving more detail in the image. For now though, you'll have to look elsewhere if you're in the market for a fully future-proofed HDR set. What it lacks in terms of tech, however, the Beovision 14 makes up for in design. B&O's eye for aesthetics has produced a refined-looking set, with something called 'oak wood lamellas' adorning the front of the Beovision 14, and an aluminium frame surrounding the whole thing. It also comes in two sizes: 40 and 55-inches. Related: What is HDR? Of course, all this classiness doesn't come cheap. The 40-inch model is available in Bang & Olufsen stores for £5,190 with oak speaker cover, and £4,495 with cloth speaker cover. If you want to go for the bigger option, the 55-inch model is going for £7,190 with oak speaker cover and £6,495 with a cloth cover. Pretty pricey stuff, especially considering there's no HDR support. Still, there's no denying this is a classy-looking set from a company that produces some seriously high-quality products. The TV will also link with any of your BeoLink Multiroom products and comes with a Bluetooth enabled BeoRemote. With that in mind, if you've got the cash, we'd bet the Beovision 14 is a worthwhile investment, but we're obviously yet to test it out, so stay tuned for a full review.

Pictured: Chris Martin, lead singer of Coldplay, performs with the band during the half-time show at the NFL's Super Bowl 50 between the Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos in Santa Clara, California February 7, 2016.Reuters Is Coldplay going to perform in Mumbai or did Google India just troll on millions of fans? On Wednesday, Aug. 10, the website tweeted that the British boy band will perform in Mumbai on Nov. 19 but mysteriously deleted the post later. Google India's tweet simply stated that Coldplay will perform in Mumbai's MMRDA grounds but didn't give any other details. Almost minutes later, the tweet was deleted. However, many seem to be under the impression that the four member band will perform in the country. Why advertise with us?

On Twitter, news of Coldplay's performance in Mumbai sparked hope among those who are ready to travel the distance in order to watch the band's dreamy songs being performed live. So far, there hasn't been an official confirmation from Coldplay and neither has Google India issued a statement about the tweet. Nonetheless, rumours about the British band's performance in India have been rife for a while now. .@coldplay to perform in Mumbai :D Come already!!!! *November*— Ashna (@AshnaSawhney) August 10, 2016 Fix yourself.. @coldplay is coming to Mumbai!— Nilay (@sanghvi_nilay) August 10, 2016 So Coldplay is coming to Mumbai in November ? Yes please ??✨ pic.twitter.com/Wmru9AIuqG— Jay (@jay96_shah) August 10, 2016 Earlier, many outlets claimed that Coldplay might perform in Mumbai for a charity concert organised by the Global Poverty Project. But the band's official website doesn't include tour dates for the months of October and November. If the band indeed holds a performance in Mumbai, it will afford many an opportunity to see them live and not just at an impromptu gig. The band's frontman Chris Martin surprised everyone after taking to stage during a concert in Delhi last year. Unfortunately, many fans of the singer missed out on his performance.  Coldplay is currently touring the U.S. after the release of their latest album "A Head Full of Dreams."  Also read Where to watch 'Pretty Little Liars' Season 7 episode 7 online Post Comment IBT TV Close Kanye West cuts concert short after Kim Kardashian robbed at gunpoint Why advertise with us?

Its merger with Chinese rival Didi Chuxing (formerly Didi Kuaidi), announced on Aug 1, meant the American ride-hailing firm has given up its operations for a small stake in the Chinese ride-hailing giant. Some commentators have hailed it as a boon for Uber, which has been in a bruising billion-dollar battle with Didi for years. But there is no denying who the loser is in this bout. As The Economist put it: “The brash Silicon Valley giant has done what seemed unthinkable just a few weeks ago: Surrendered.” If it is any consolation, Uber can find plenty of rich shoulders to cry on back home. It has joined a glittering alumni of slain United States tech giants, many of whom still have carcasses rotting in the Chinese cyberspace. They include Google, Yahoo, Amazon, eBay, MySpace, Groupon, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. The record of major American Internet companies in China has been abysmal and there are recurring themes behind their failures. COPY AND PASTE DOESN’T WORK Most of these tech giants committed a classic mistake of replicating its successful business model at home in China. But as a famous management cliche goes, whatever got you here will not get you there. Uber learnt it the hard way. It insisted on using Google maps initially even though the service is not reliable in China. It stuck to credit cards as the mode of payment even though most Chinese still do not own plastic. Didi allowed its customers to pay through mobile app WeChat, which is increasingly the preferred payment method of the Chinese. EBay made the same error when it entered China in 2003. It maintained its global practice of charging for listings, only to be completely outmanoeuvred by Alibaba’s Taobao. The Chinese upstart was free to use. And while eBay continued to be an auction site, Taobao quickly moved towards sales when it became clear the Chinese netizens were uncomfortable and unfamiliar with auctions. SLOW AND STEADY LOSES THE RACE While the Chinese economy moves at breakneck speed, in its online world, the pace goes up a further notch or two. Very often, by the time a US tech giant is ready to enter China, several copycats have already been sucking up market share in the mainland. It is believed that a Chinese cyber clone can be ready in Zhongguancun in Beijing, the Silicon Valley of China, within weeks of a fresh start-up taking off across the Pacific. Take Groupon for example. By the time the group-buying giant was ready to enter China in early 2011, Chinese consumers were already familiar with dozens of domestic copycats. Groupon’s China site, Gaopeng, never took off in a big way. In the wild, wild east of China’s online space, one of its Chinese competitors even bought and set up the Chinese domain Groupon.cn, which at one point did better than Gaopeng. Similarly, Uber did not move fast enough into China. When it finally launched in the country in mid-2014, its main rivals, Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache — which would later merge to become Didi Chuxing — had already covered 434 cities cumulatively. CHEAP IS GOOD; FREE IS BETTER Chinese netizens are extremely sensitive to prices. In fact, they are almost allergic to paying for content or services online. Chinese search engine giant Baidu took off at the turn of the millennium, just when the Internet was growing in the country, because netizens wanted to download pirated songs easily. That was a major reason why many Chinese went online then. Google did not offer that. By the time it caught up with a similar free service in 2009, it was too late. Similarly, Amazon entered China in 2004 as a direct-seller, offering products from major retailers and wholesalers. In contrast, its Chinese rival Taobao preferred a model where it served as a platform for hundreds of thousands of small businesses to sell their goods. This led to a vicious price war among those businesses on Taobao, while consumers picked up cheap purchases and kept coming back for more. Amazon quickly earned a reputation in China for being more expensive than Taobao. Its humiliation was completed in 2015 when it had to open an online store on Alibaba’s online marketplace Tmall. Uber has burned an astonishing US$1 billion (S$1.34 billion) a year in China in a price war with Didi, pampering commuters with fares cheaper than taxis. It was a loss which eventually proved too heavy to sustain. LONG SHADOW OF CHINESE GOVERNMENT Even after overcoming the earlier hurdles, the American tech giants still have to come to terms with the biggest player of all in China — the government. For the likes of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, the censorship apparatus of China has been so crude, wide and long-lasting that they have not even had a chance to create a presence in the country. Access to all three sites from China have been blocked for years by a tool dubbed the Great Firewall of China. The blockage created a parallel cyber universe in China, offering clones like WeChat, Weibo and Youku plenty of space to grow. Other US players such as Google struggled with regulations which seemed determined to make the tech titans’ lives difficult. Censors constantly monitored its search engine, erasing or blocking content, before Google finally exited the market in 2010. Uber, being seen less as a threat to national security, had an easier ride comparatively. But a recent new law passed in China was still regarded as a bane for the firm. The ban on rides operating below cost, which would stop subsidies, is expected to hurt Uber more than Didi. Uber has been heavily dependent on giving subsidies to drivers so as to grow its market share. CHINESE CLONES OUTWIT US MASTERS The American companies have been repeatedly outsmarted by their Chinese rivals, which have adapted their products to suit the Chinese netizens better. WeChat, for instance, has morphed from a WhatsApp clone into an all-in-one Internet platform which allows payments, games, file-sharing, in addition to instant messaging. Sina Weibo, China’s top microblog, has also overtaken Twitter with features popular with the Chinese, such as a wider range of emoticons and easier tracking of comments. Even Didi went one better than Uber, starting its operations with taxi hailing and not private cars so as to ease the angst of taxi drivers and with that relations with the local authorities. Such adaptability are sorely needed by the US tech giants if they wish to succeed in China. Not only must they be fast and nimble, but they have to also be prepared to rip apart their winning formula and offer a vastly different product in China. The Chinese market does come with its peculiarities which demand precision and a unique approach. As Alibaba’s Jack Ma said: “eBay may be a shark in the ocean, but I am a crocodile in the Yangtze River. If we fight in the ocean, we lose — but if we fight in the river, we win.” In the cyberspace of China, with a mouth-watering market of 700 million netizens, the Chinese crocodiles have reigned supreme.

MENU Economy Business Politics and Policy Technology Reflections Arts, Culture & Society Anything But Books Entertainment & Variety Sports All News Authors Search Technology Google can inform, but also deceive Shashwat Dhar Krishanu B. Neog August 10, 2016, 15:21 IST Reality is made of numbers. Data. Statistics. But there are technicalities that limit the credibility of data science. And this applies especially with the internet, whose ubiquity has encouraged the use of data analytics to make assertions about sociological truths. Google searches shed light on information. Google Trends risks showing information in a deceptive light. share this article Has the internet moved on from being a mere ‘virtual’ space divorced from our ‘real’ world to emerging as a space in which the activities of multiple users can help us predict and analyse socio-political behaviour? However nuanced the answer to this question may be, it is proving to be a potentially embarrassing situation for quite a few prominent media outlets. This state of affairs was precipitated recently by a rather singular bit of information from Google Trends: ‘What is the EU’ was the second-most oft-asked Google query in the UK the day after the Referendum results were announced, followed in the third place by the query ‘What will happen if Britain leaves the EU’. Google Trends, as is well-known, is a tool that allows one to find indexed information on search activity that takes place on Google on any subject, over a period of time, and in a specified geographical region. Xenophobia and the ‘ignorant masses’ Owing to the certainty with which these tidbits about the referendum were circulated, they soon dovetailed into the larger narrative of how a certain section of xenophobic, ill-informed British voters had imperiled both Britain and Europe. This narrative was in circulation in reputed news and media outlets like The Washington Post, National Public Radio (NPR), fortune.com, etc. Even the celebrated talk-show host John Oliver featured it in one of his diatribes. The narrative, however, has now been contested by software developer and data analyst Danny Page who, along with Remy Smith, a Political Science student from Northwestern University, Illinois, has shown that the number of people Googling ‘What is the EU?’ in the days after the referendum was actually under a 1,000. The number of people Googling the same question before the elections in May 2016 was around 231 everyday; the spike noted in Google Trends was a result of this low base-line. Page further pointed out that there was no contextualisation of the data, as it did not show if the voters were from the Leave or Remain camp, or eligible for voting, etc. @rohitguptahpf @bencasselman even if you consider the data valid (such as the dates being accurate) the UK has 65m people, 17m voted remain— Daniel P. McGrady (@dmix) June 28, 2016 It must, however, be noted at this juncture that there were events and circumstances that might reinforce this narrative, given the rise in the attacks on immigrants and peoples-of-colour in Britain after the referendum, the varied levels of populist anti-immigration rhetoric championed by the Brexit leaders (and many other parties in Europe), the murder of British Labour MP Jo Cox, the uncertain future of Britain’s already devastated economy and the attendant impoverishment and anger among its working classes (especially white), etc. This turn of events, however, does bring to our attention the need for exercising caution while making analytical generalisations about socio-political phenomena using internet data. Search engines as analytic tools ^Google searches reveal a lot about the human being users. But it's important to be nuanced when interpreting the analytics of such searches. Using Google Trends has proven to be helpful in accurate analysis in other cases. In a paper published in the journal Nature in 2009, four researches from Google along with their colleague from the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention proposed a system whereby it became possible to pinpoint locations of outbreaks of influenza by correlating Google-search queries with other variables. Such approaches have also been tried using the recorded number of visits to particular web-sites and Yahoo search results. For many noted media scholars like Dr. Richard Rogers of the University of Amsterdam, such approaches could spawn new methods of socio-political analysis where empirical data on online-search habits / interests can help researchers in saying something meaningful about the world at large. The adoption of such a method of socio-political analysis seems appropriate in an age where Xerox Corporation scientist Mark Weiser’s vision of ‘ubiquitous computing’ — where computers disappear into the ‘fabric of everyday life’ — increasingly comes true. Internet-enabled computing devices are becoming a rather unremarkable part of our everyday lives, much as Weiser had envisioned. Given this state of affairs, it becomes increasingly meaningless to treat the internet as a ‘cyber-space’ separate from the ‘real world’, the prevalent way of thinking for the greater part of the period since the Internet came into existence. However, the development of this method is still at a nascent stage, and that makes the cavalier interpretations such as those made about the Brexit impinge on the credibility of future attempts at such analysis. The effectiveness of using search-engine queries to build analyses and narratives can be understood by the fact that search engines remain the primary platform for accessing information and content online for most internet-users across the world. But the political implications of search engines hardly end there. The fact that traces of our search queries are maintained in databases is already a source of widespread concern. The selection of results that our Google search queries generate topmost on our screens is decided by algorithms and that has been a source of controversy since the days of Larry Page’s PageRank, Google’s earliest algorithm that ranked websites according to their perceived ‘importance’. Now that there are tools available to capture ‘trends’ on Facebook and Twitter with geographical and temporal pin-pointing capabilities more attempts at such analysis can be expected in the future. Such concerns have only increased over the decades as, now, the search engine is no longer solely responsible for inclusion or exclusion of results to a query; in a process called ‘registrational interactivity’, the algorithms display results based on the past preferences of the users, thus shifting the responsibility for the selection of search results onto the users themselves. In spite of the dubiousness that now clouds the Brexit Google Trends affair, it does reveal the contested nature of the current political environment, where terms like ‘people’, ‘nation’, ‘outsider’, ‘democracy’ etc. are being re-defined in the media and elsewhere. Now that there are tools available to capture ‘trends’ on Facebook and Twitter with geographical and temporal pin-pointing capabilities more attempts at such analysis can be expected in the future. Even though these tools provide real-time data about political behaviour and insights into what goes on in people’s heads at a particular point in time (say before, on, and after the election day), they need to be interpreted in their proper context, with the caveat that such trends may only provide a very limited and superficial understanding of complex socio-political realities particularly in low-income countries, which typically have low levels of internet penetration.

The description read: "Google has no grounds whasoever for omitting Palestine from its maps. The fact that Israel - an artificial state established on Palestinian territory - is clearly designated on Google Maps, while Palestine itself has been "airbrushed" out, is outrageous and deeply offensive to Palestinians. It is the online parallel of Israel's policy of demolishing Palestinian villages and changing Palestinian place names in an effort to erase Palestine from the map. Google is aiding and abetting the Israeli government in this ethnic cleansing program."

Thank you. pic.twitter.com/bbmz7XcRLv — Haya Önügören (@haya_atassi) August 9, 2016 According to Al Arabiya, a Google spokeman wrote to them clarifying the situation of Palestine's apparent obliteration from its maps.  "There has never been a ‘Palestine’ label on Google Maps, however we discovered a bug that removed the labels for “West Bank” and “Gaza Strip”. We’re working quickly to bring these labels back to the area,” the spokesperson said. “As background, our basemap data, which includes information like place names, borders, and road networks, comes from a combination of third-party providers and public sources. While this helps us provide a comprehensive map, it also means that the amount of data we have varies from place to place and you can see this reflected in our maps.” A glitch recently has removed the dotted red lines from what was previously labelled as West Bank and Gaza. In the past, users who searched for Palestine were zoomed into the territory of Israel with dotted red lines around the occupied territories of West Bank and Gaza.  However, Google manages issues of disputed territory by showing different maps to people depending on where they are searching from. And it shows those disputed areas in dotted red lines to allow people to make their own decisions about geopolitical issues. For example, in India, Arunachal Pradesh is shown as a part of Indian territory, whereas a user in China would view it as a part of China and users in the US would see a dotted red line around the border.  This is what seems to be happening to Palestine's position on the map.   1.5k facebook twitter reddit Comment Here Follow @indiatimes Our Channels News Lifestyle Entertainment Health Videos Sports Trending Sections india world sports weird self style Tech who we are travel food bollywood celebscoop hollywood Healthy Living Recipes Inspire Tips & Tricks Buzz Photogallery Indiatimes Lifestyle Network MENS XP iDiva Luxury Ask Men Pursuitist Specials #FRONTLINES #GOFORGOLD #INDIANAMA Other Sites News – TO CricBuzz Happy Trips Business Insider ZoomTv Gizmodo Lifehacker IGN BoxTV Gaana Online Shopping Techradar Daily Deals Gitanjali Shop Satvik Shop WHAT'S HOT ZigWheels FILMIPOP Filmfare Femina Mobile Greetings Follo Jobs Property Astrology Speaking Tree Matrimonial iTimes Ads2book TcNext Romedy Now About us Mobile Apps ARCHIVES sitemap Contact us ABOUT INDIATIMES Privacy Policy Terms & CONDITIONS Copyright © 2016 Times Internet Limited.

Ian McGregor, who runs the Bangkok Bistro in Penrith, says that when people search online for the restaurant, Google lists it as “permanently closed”. It isn't. The 50-seater Thai restaurant in Poet's Walk has traded without interruption since he took it over last October. Mr McGregor, 52, said: “We were made aware of this by a customer three weeks ago. We've even had regulars asking 'are you closed?'. “Penrith is a very touristy town and, although we're still getting locals in, tourists are searching for us on Google and being told we are shut. “We rely on the tourist trade at this time of year. July and August should be the busiest time of year for us and instead we are dead.” He has already had to release one of his five employees because of the slump in trade. He estimates that takings have dipped by between £4,000 and £5,000 in three weeks. Mr McGregor's attempts to get Google to correct the error have come to nothing. He said: “I've not had much response to be honest. I've reported it online but when you ring them you get an answering machine. "I've left messages but nobody has got back.” Google told the News & Star that it would look into Mr McGregor's complaint. However, at the time of going to press Bangkok Bistro was still listed as “permanently closed”. Mr McGregor has looked into bringing a legal claim for damages against Google but has ruled that out as too expensive. He said: “I've been told by a solicitor that I would probably win but would need a couple of hundred thousands pounds behind me to fight the case. "I don't know what else I can do. Google are a massive company and I'm just a tiny business.” He added: “I'd love to know how the error came about. Who told Google that we're closed? "It could have been someone with a grudge against the business. I don't know. Whoever has done it has caused me a lot of grief.” 10 August 2016 12:00PM View comments Comment on this article Email: First name: Last name: Location: Comment: Please enter the code: Generate a new code Nicholas   McDonough , Los Angeles, CA Thursday, 18 August, 2016 at 8:12PM Could be a case of not properly claiming your business.

Palestine, although recognised as a country by the United Nations, has never been on Google Maps. Instead of being demarcated with a solid line that denotes a country border, Google instead defines the Gaza Strip and the West Bank with a dashed border - the mark it uses to outline disputed territories.   Google was forced to explain that it doesn't define Palestine as a country separate from Israel on Maps after a petition signed by 250,000 people described the company's "airbrushing" of Palestine as "deeply offensive" and called for the internet giant to put Palestine on its map.  A glitch that briefly removed the labels for the West Bank and Gaza sparked outrage on social media, with people tweeting under the hashtag #PalestineIsHere.  #palestinenotforsale #PalestineIsHere #Palestine pic.twitter.com/d4AsJlMkei— Qasim Rasheed™ (@Qasimization) August 10, 2016 Dear #Google , Where is #Palestine?

"Recognition of Palestine by Google may even turn out to be as important as recognition by organisations like the UN."  Google said in a response that Palestine had never been marked as a territory on its map, but that a glitch in the software had resulted in Palestinian areas being removed.  "There has never been a 'Palestine' label on Google Maps," said a spokesman for Google. "However, we discovered a bug that removed the labels for 'West Bank' and 'Gaza Strip'. We're working quickly to get these labels back to the area."  Back in 2013 Google "followed the lead of the UN" and updated the Palestinian version of its Search homepage with the description "Palestine" as opposed to "Palestinian Territories". In a significant mile stone in the conflict, the Palestinian flag was raised at the UN's headquarters last year.  The 2013 change on Google's Palestinian site was hailed as a triumph for the Palestinian Authority Credit: Google The company thinks carefully about how to mark disputed regions on Maps. A website called Disputed Territories has collected some of the areas that Google displays differently depending on the country that's looking at it. For example, on maps.google.co.uk Crimea is defined with a dotted line, indicating that the area is occupied territory. But on the Russian site maps.google.ru it's separated from Ukraine with a solid line.  google chrome extensions   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Palestinian Authority Google Israel Palestinian Territories Show more Technology latest 23 Nov 2016, 4:30pm Parking chaos as payment app RingGo offline across the country  23 Nov 2016, 11:24am Facebook 'prepares to suppress posts in bid to enter China' 23 Nov 2016, 11:02am How much of the UK has mobile phone coverage?

Clint Boulton (CIO (US)) 10 August, 2016 02:59 - - - - print email Comments Fully automated, self-driving cars are likely decades away from being a reality, says Nicholas Carr, the author whose books about technology and culture seek to curb the heady enthusiasm regarding the digitalization of everything. Nicholas Carr. “I think a lot of the visions of total automation assume that every vehicle will be automated and the entire driving infrastructure will not only be mapped in minute detail but will also be outfitted with the kind of sensors and transmitters and all of the networking infrastructure that we're going to need,” Carr tells CIO.com. Autonomous car proponents and technology enthusiasts in general will certainly disagree with Carr. No surprise there. In May 2003, the Harvard Business Review published Carr’s book “IT Doesn’t Matter,” which raised the ire of technology luminaries such as Bill Gates and Carly Fiorina by challenging the notion that IT infrastructure provided enterprises with a strategic advantage. Most CIOs didn’t care for it either, feeling as though their roles were being denigrated at a time when CEOs were beginning to understand that some technology, well, does matter. Carr has long since been vindicated. The utility computing model Carr described in 2003 became known as cloud computing. And with each SaaS app an enterprise CIO implements, software as a service becomes commoditized a bit more. [ Related: Nicholas Carr: The Internet is Hurting Our Brains ] Now Carr is back with a new book, “Utopia is Creepy: And Other Provocations,” which W.W. Norton Co. is releasing on Sept. 6. It’s a compendium of essays, from “Is Google Making Us Stupid,” to “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Privacy.” Software may be eating the world, but one thing that perpetually eats at Carr is the irrational exuberance espoused by Silicon Valley, which preach es that technology is the answer to everything. Apps will usher in world peace and end world hunger. At the very least, they’ll enable us to take a nap while tooling around in our API and lidar-fueled motor vehicles. Well, one of these decades, anyway. CIO.com: What is the premise of “Utopia is Creepy?” Nicholas Carr: Utopia is Creepy is a collection of pieces that I've written and posted to my Rough Type blog over the last dozen years. This is kind of Rough Type's greatest hits, as well as some essays that I wrote at the same time, including "Is Google Making Us Stupid," which is probably the best-known of those. When Rough Type hit its 10th anniversary in 2015 I started going back through the posts and I realized there were a lot of pieces that had some resonance. I also started to see was that I’d given a blow-by-blow description of what was going on in the tech world, particularly the rise of what used to be called Web 2.0 and is now known as social media and social networking. It was also a critique of the Silicon Valley ideology -- the sense that the internet and social media was bringing down the barriers to self-expression, freeing people up and if we place our trust in Silicon Valley and the programmers there it would lead to a kind of utopia. It's a collection but one with a theme that runs through it. CIO.com: What are a couple of examples of this Silicon Valley irrational exuberance that comes to mind? Carr: When we saw the resurrection of the internet after the big dot-com bust, there was this sense that the walls of old media and the gatekeepers were coming down and there was golden age of people in control of their own expression and what they read. This was a strong theme back then. There was Wired cover story called “We are the web” that presented this as a whole new world opening up. What we've seensince then has been very different. The old gatekeepers, to the extent they were gatekeepers, have been replaced by companies like Facebook and Google and companies that really now have become the new media companies and are very much controlling the flow of information. If anything we're more deeply in the grip of the new media companies than we ever have been. Another example is a sense that we human beings need to get out of the way and let algorithms and robots take over because in some fashion -- at least this is how it's presented -- robots are more reliable and more perfect and faster than human beings. This is translated by Silicon Valley and others that we're all going to be freed up and won’t have to work anymore and that by handing off our jobs to machines and computers and robots that we'll have all of this time and we'll be more creative. CIO.com: What I’m hearing out of MIT, other academia and from analysts at Gartner and Forrester is that robots will augment and support humans in their work, rather than replace them outright. Carr: There is a well-argued counter philosophy to this sense that ultimately artificial intelligence and robots will take over the bulk of labor. I still think that's a common theme coming out of Silicon Valley from people like Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, who quite explicitly say it may take a little time but ultimately, as Andreessen puts it, software is eating the world and we're going to figure out what happens in the post-work environment. This is a dream that's been around since the Industrial Revolution -- that machines are going to take over -- and it never panned out. Which is not to say there aren't huge technological shifts in the labor force -- there are – but I think it's an expression of faith in computers to solve in a magical way these difficult problems that we're always going to be dealing with. The danger here is that often as a society we're prone to buying into this sense that if we just automate, for example, healthcare suddenly we'll have an efficient system and that will cure a lot of ills. And it has the effect too often of generating complacency, that we don't have to struggle with these things because technology is going to solve these problems. CIO.com: I can see that. Every time we have a major machine learning breakthrough – the computer beating a human in Go comes to mind – the excitement fades as we're reminded of how far we are from true AI. Carr: You have to suspend your disbelief when you're interacting with your computers or your smartphone or Siri to not recognize how far away we are [from AI]. Which is not to downplay our enormous advances. If you look at self-driving cars, particularly when Google announced in 2010 that it had a car running on well-mapped highways that was pretty darn good, that announcement came at a time when people said driving is one thing that computers could never take over because it's all of these tacit skills and instinct and intuition built up. Even there I think we're still further than most people think away from a fully automated vehicle. But nevertheless it if truly amazing what has happened. CIO.com: If you listen to Google, Tesla and others the self-driving technology is far closer than the political reality. How far away are we from fully automated cars? Carr: I think we can get up to 99 percent [of the technology necessary for fully autonomous vehicles] pretty quickly but is that going to be enough? I don't think it is. Because driving has so many uncertainties. It seems to me that in order to get to the point of full automation you're going to have all sorts of infrastructural changes. You're going to have to deal with the fact that the automotive fleet is very long lasting. It takes many years to turn over the cars that people drive, which means you're going to have fully automated vehicles, semi-automated vehicles and human-driven vehicles on the road at the same time and that becomes very, very complicated. I think a lot of the visions of total automation assume that every vehicle will be automated and the entire driving infrastructure will not only be mapped in minute detail but will also be outfitted with the kind of sensors and transmitters and all of the networking infrastructure that we're going to need. And it just seems to me that it will take a long time -- decades. Having said that I think you can see areas where you can isolate automated vehicles. You can envision some kind of system where you automate long-haul trucking. And you can see a king of Google car serving as a taxi in certain situations. But I think this dream of everything being automated in the next 10 years is unrealistic. I could see all of these stages en route where different aspects become automated even if the whole system does not. CIO.com: How do you see the role of the CIO evolving? I see a dual role for CIOs now. As we move toward an era where you’re no longer in control of the IT, such as managing the data center your company runs on, you become the broker between all of the IT capabilities, both in-house and outside – and you become a strategic broker in figuring out how we should get the right mix of capabilities and where they should come from. And I think that you need smart people to do that in companies. The other is a more strategic role of figuring out where we should invest that in a way that will give us competitive distinguish us. That’s an important role whether that has to reside in a CIO-type role or it can move to other places in the company I think that’s always going to be a certain tension.

MENU Economy Business Politics and Policy Technology Reflections Arts, Culture & Society Anything But Books Entertainment & Variety Sports All News Authors Search Technology Google can inform, but also deceive Shashwat Dhar Krishanu B. Neog August 10, 2016, 15:21 IST Reality is made of numbers. Data. Statistics. But there are technicalities that limit the credibility of data science. And this applies especially with the internet, whose ubiquity has encouraged the use of data analytics to make assertions about sociological truths. Google searches shed light on information. Google Trends risks showing information in a deceptive light. share this article Has the internet moved on from being a mere ‘virtual’ space divorced from our ‘real’ world to emerging as a space in which the activities of multiple users can help us predict and analyse socio-political behaviour? However nuanced the answer to this question may be, it is proving to be a potentially embarrassing situation for quite a few prominent media outlets. This state of affairs was precipitated recently by a rather singular bit of information from Google Trends: ‘What is the EU’ was the second-most oft-asked Google query in the UK the day after the Referendum results were announced, followed in the third place by the query ‘What will happen if Britain leaves the EU’. Google Trends, as is well-known, is a tool that allows one to find indexed information on search activity that takes place on Google on any subject, over a period of time, and in a specified geographical region. Xenophobia and the ‘ignorant masses’ Owing to the certainty with which these tidbits about the referendum were circulated, they soon dovetailed into the larger narrative of how a certain section of xenophobic, ill-informed British voters had imperiled both Britain and Europe. This narrative was in circulation in reputed news and media outlets like The Washington Post, National Public Radio (NPR), fortune.com, etc. Even the celebrated talk-show host John Oliver featured it in one of his diatribes. The narrative, however, has now been contested by software developer and data analyst Danny Page who, along with Remy Smith, a Political Science student from Northwestern University, Illinois, has shown that the number of people Googling ‘What is the EU?’ in the days after the referendum was actually under a 1,000. The number of people Googling the same question before the elections in May 2016 was around 231 everyday; the spike noted in Google Trends was a result of this low base-line. Page further pointed out that there was no contextualisation of the data, as it did not show if the voters were from the Leave or Remain camp, or eligible for voting, etc. @rohitguptahpf @bencasselman even if you consider the data valid (such as the dates being accurate) the UK has 65m people, 17m voted remain— Daniel P. McGrady (@dmix) June 28, 2016 It must, however, be noted at this juncture that there were events and circumstances that might reinforce this narrative, given the rise in the attacks on immigrants and peoples-of-colour in Britain after the referendum, the varied levels of populist anti-immigration rhetoric championed by the Brexit leaders (and many other parties in Europe), the murder of British Labour MP Jo Cox, the uncertain future of Britain’s already devastated economy and the attendant impoverishment and anger among its working classes (especially white), etc. This turn of events, however, does bring to our attention the need for exercising caution while making analytical generalisations about socio-political phenomena using internet data. Search engines as analytic tools ^Google searches reveal a lot about the human being users. But it's important to be nuanced when interpreting the analytics of such searches. Using Google Trends has proven to be helpful in accurate analysis in other cases. In a paper published in the journal Nature in 2009, four researches from Google along with their colleague from the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention proposed a system whereby it became possible to pinpoint locations of outbreaks of influenza by correlating Google-search queries with other variables. Such approaches have also been tried using the recorded number of visits to particular web-sites and Yahoo search results. For many noted media scholars like Dr. Richard Rogers of the University of Amsterdam, such approaches could spawn new methods of socio-political analysis where empirical data on online-search habits / interests can help researchers in saying something meaningful about the world at large. The adoption of such a method of socio-political analysis seems appropriate in an age where Xerox Corporation scientist Mark Weiser’s vision of ‘ubiquitous computing’ — where computers disappear into the ‘fabric of everyday life’ — increasingly comes true. Internet-enabled computing devices are becoming a rather unremarkable part of our everyday lives, much as Weiser had envisioned. Given this state of affairs, it becomes increasingly meaningless to treat the internet as a ‘cyber-space’ separate from the ‘real world’, the prevalent way of thinking for the greater part of the period since the Internet came into existence. However, the development of this method is still at a nascent stage, and that makes the cavalier interpretations such as those made about the Brexit impinge on the credibility of future attempts at such analysis. The effectiveness of using search-engine queries to build analyses and narratives can be understood by the fact that search engines remain the primary platform for accessing information and content online for most internet-users across the world. But the political implications of search engines hardly end there. The fact that traces of our search queries are maintained in databases is already a source of widespread concern. The selection of results that our Google search queries generate topmost on our screens is decided by algorithms and that has been a source of controversy since the days of Larry Page’s PageRank, Google’s earliest algorithm that ranked websites according to their perceived ‘importance’. Now that there are tools available to capture ‘trends’ on Facebook and Twitter with geographical and temporal pin-pointing capabilities more attempts at such analysis can be expected in the future. Such concerns have only increased over the decades as, now, the search engine is no longer solely responsible for inclusion or exclusion of results to a query; in a process called ‘registrational interactivity’, the algorithms display results based on the past preferences of the users, thus shifting the responsibility for the selection of search results onto the users themselves. In spite of the dubiousness that now clouds the Brexit Google Trends affair, it does reveal the contested nature of the current political environment, where terms like ‘people’, ‘nation’, ‘outsider’, ‘democracy’ etc. are being re-defined in the media and elsewhere. Now that there are tools available to capture ‘trends’ on Facebook and Twitter with geographical and temporal pin-pointing capabilities more attempts at such analysis can be expected in the future. Even though these tools provide real-time data about political behaviour and insights into what goes on in people’s heads at a particular point in time (say before, on, and after the election day), they need to be interpreted in their proper context, with the caveat that such trends may only provide a very limited and superficial understanding of complex socio-political realities particularly in low-income countries, which typically have low levels of internet penetration.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google Maps New Features are for Emerging Markets August 10, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts GoPro Unveils Telemetric Addition for Footage Captured Through Hero 5 Qualcomm Reveals Quick Charge 4.0; Will Debut with Snapdragon 835 It might be on the top when considering navigation apps, but Google Maps still has got its own issues, and it reaches the peak when stepping down to lower end smartphones. But efforts from the Mountain View Company is now producing some better solutions for this. On Tuesday, Google announced its latest update for the Google Maps app, which aims at providing two new features to the app: Wi-Fi only option, and the option to download to SD cards. That might not exactly sound like a big update, but Google is serving the right dishes with its new update for the target audience, which is the low-end smartphone users from the emerging markets. For a budget smartphone user, relying on internal space might not feel like the best option, and the introduction of downloading to SD card means that they can have a chill pill now. Google’s offline map download have been a catchy feature, but the bulky size of the offline maps often stood as the barrier for low-mid range devices. Even 32GB device users should find it hard to download a map weighing over 2GB considering that the inbuilt storage would mostly be spared for multimedia usage. This along with the usual pre-paid/limited data plan has been a big concern for Google in expanding its Map services’ access in emerging markets. An option to download through Wi-Fi only not only should benefit limited plan subscribers, but also for users who travel abroad, letting them save data roaming charges. Google has been testing the Wi-Fi only mode for over a month. As you can expect, the update is made available for Android devices, and it includes additional features like integrations with Go-Jek and Grab in Southeast Asia, and expansion of Gett, Hailo and MyTaxi support to more European nations.

Photograph: Google Maps Elena Cresci @elenacresci Wednesday 10 August 2016 05.50 EDT Last modified on Thursday 13 October 2016 16.04 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 3 months old Google has been accused of deleting Palestine from Google Maps – but the truth is, it was never labelled by Google in the first place. When searching for Palestine on Google Maps, it shows an outline, but with no label for Palestine and Israel labelled alongside it. While 136 members of the United Nations recognise Palestine as an independent state, the US and much of the west does not. The representation of Palestine on Google Maps has not changed recently, but after the forum of Palestinian journalists released a statement condemning Google, word spread via social media and later news outlets. People began sharing their outrage using the hashtag #PalestineIsHere. Talbia Akbar Khan (@talbiaakbar) Removing #Palestine from the map doesn't mean it ceases to exist. #PalestineIsHere pic.twitter.com/uQfIDcJOka August 9, 2016 Fatih Yağcı (@FatihYagciResmi) Shame on you @google ! How dare you to support Israil and erase Palestine from @googlemaps ! #PalestineIsHere August 9, 2016 A Google spokeswoman said: “There has never been a ‘Palestine’ label on Google Maps, however we discovered a bug that removed the labels for ‘West Bank’ and ‘Gaza Strip’. We’re working quickly to bring these labels back to the area.” A petition from March this year urging Google to include Palestine on their maps has gained traction in the last few days, now with almost 250,000 signatures. While nothing has changed, the online outrage has pointed to questions about how mapping technologies affect people’s understanding of the world. The Washington Post’s Caitlyn Dewey wrote: In their attempts to dispassionately document the physical world online, tech companies often end up shaping our understanding of it, too. That’s not something that we tend to think about often, but it does become pretty obvious when a map changes/is said to have changed, or when we compare different maps against each other. This is not the first time Google has got into hot water over disputed territories – and it’s likely not to be the last. A 2014 project called Disputed Territories documented how Google Maps attempts to stay out of geographical disputes and issues of national identity. For example: users in Russia see a solid boundary line around Russia and Crimea. Outside of Russia, Crimea is surrounded by dashed lines, indicating it as occupied territory.

A Gaza-based journalism forum claims Google changed its maps in late July. By Callum Paton August 10, 2016 10:40 BST The forum said that by deleting Palestine on 25 July Google had attempted to tamper with the memory of Palestinians and ArabsGoogle Maps The hashtag #PalestineIsHere has ignited a firestorm on social media with a petition on change.org to have the Palestinian territories reinstated on Google Maps garnering more than 240,000 supporters. Claims the US internet giant removed Palestine from its maps of the Middle East appears to have originated from The Forum of Palestinian Journalists. "The Forum of Palestinian Journalists condemns the crime carried out by Google in deleting the name of Palestine, and calls for Google to rescind its decision and apologise to the Palestinian people," the Gaza-based group said in a statement on 3 August. The Forum said in its statement that by deleting Palestine on 25 July Google had attempted to tamper with the memory of Palestinians and Arabs as well as the world. However, despite the outrage and the change.org petition, which was started five months ago, well before the journalists issued their statement, the Washington Post reports the maps remain unchanged and Palestine was never officially marked in the first place. Google has employed tactics in Israel and Palestine which it has used consistently in its maps thoughout the world to deal with sensitive and disputed territories. At present the map does not show Palestine but shows the territories delineated by a dotted line. It stretches from Jerusalem in the west to the Jordanian border and then from Hebron to Jenin north to south. The search engine has similarly dealt with tricky cartographical challenges in Kashmir and Crimea but none of these other issues – perhaps unsurprisingly – have provoked such outrage. Twitter users have called Google's depiction of Palestine a "despicable act of erasure" and an explicit backing of Israel in the Middle East. The change.org petition itself accuses Google of "abetting the Israeli government in this ethnic cleansing program". "The fact that Israel - an artificial state established on Palestinian territory - is clearly designated on Google Maps, while Palestine itself has been 'airbrushed' out, is outrageous and deeply offensive to Palestinians. "It is the online parallel of Israel's policy of demolishing Palestinian villages and changing Palestinian place names in an effort to erase Palestine from the map," the website reads. Representatives for Google were not immediately able to comment on this article at the time of publication.

The FCC and FTC want to know why. 11 May 2016 11 Android, iOS, Law & order, Mobile, Vulnerability Post navigation Previous: Former US army contractor sentenced for damaging computer systems, lying about serving in China’s army Next: Judge dismisses police attempt to get Lauri Love’s encryption keys by John Zorabedian 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Dear mobile device manufacturers and carriers: the US government has a lot of questions for you about how you’re protecting consumers from security vulnerabilities. Earlier this week, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) sent letters to mobile carriers seeking answers to questions about how they provide security updates to their customers. At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating the security update processes of eight mobile device manufacturers, including biggies Google, Apple, Samsung and HTC. The FTC ordered the companies to respond to an exhaustively detailed questionnaire. The FCC and FTC investigations into the issue of mobile security updates come nearly 10 months after a critical vulnerability in Android known as the Stagefright bug left 95% of Android devices – potentially 1 billion users – vulnerable to malicious media files. The FCC’s statement on the inquiry noted that an “growing number of vulnerabilities” in mobile operating systems threaten the security and privacy of business and personal communications. Yet the way mobile device manufacturers, OS providers and mobile carriers have responded to vulnerabilities can leave users unprotected “for long periods of time or even indefinitely,” the FCC said: Consumers may be left unprotected, for long periods of time or even indefinitely, by any delays in patching vulnerabilities once they are discovered. To date, operating system providers, original equipment manufacturers, and mobile service providers have responded to address vulnerabilities as they arise. There are, however, significant delays in delivering patches to actual devices – and that older devices may never be patched. As Google announced in its second annual Android security report, released last month, about 30% of Android devices are running older versions of the OS that Google no longer supports with security updates. Google began issuing monthly Android security updates, in August 2015, but only Google-manufactured Nexus devices get updates directly from Google. Android is an open source OS, which allows carriers and mobile device OEMs to create their own custom versions of Android, and the vast majority of Android devices get security updates from the carriers, who may take months to push the updates out. Apple’s security update process for iOS is tightly controlled by Apple, not the carriers, but its process for updating iDevices isn’t exactly transparent. Other non-Android mobile device manufacturers, such as Microsoft and BlackBerry, have their own processes for issuing security updates. How the mobile device makers decide which vulnerabilities to patch, and when, is precisely the kind of information the FTC is seeking in its order. The FTC told the companies that it needs to explain which device models it supports with security updates, which models are no longer supported, how it determines which models receive the updates, and whether and how it communicates that information to consumers. The FTC also demanded to know how the mobile device companies have responded to “each vulnerability that … could result in unauthorized code execution or compromise the confidentiality of consumer data.” For each specific device model identified in response to Specification 5(A), please identify each vulnerability that has affected the specific device model that could result in unauthorized code execution or the compromise of the confidentiality of consumer data. Describe in detail the Company’s response to the vulnerability… The mobile device makers have 45 days to respond to the FTC.

The FCC and FTC want to know why.” Mahhn says: May 11, 2016 at 7:19 pm I’d like to know why the FCC isn’t pushing for encryption for all cell communication. Since ISMI catchers can be purchased or built for as little as $1,500 to $1500. Anyone can ease drop on anyone’s conversations that are not encrypted. Just do a search for ISMI catchers. Reply Paul Ducklin says: May 11, 2016 at 11:27 pm Correct me if I am wrong: this isn’t really about encryption but about authentication. The loophole in GSM that allows a phone to authenticate with a bogus base station was removed in UMTS, the successor to GSM, which requires each side to verify the other… …except that most networks and phones allow fallback to old-school GSM. If there is a way to turn GSM support off on your phone then I am guessing that you might lose coverage more frequently (no fallback) but also be immune to this sort of interception (no fallback). Reply Mahhn says: May 16, 2016 at 1:29 pm I haven’t seen a way to let a phone pick which Cell signal to connect to., not to say it doesn’t exist. While at a sec conf last year I was talking with a guy who was testing some ISMI catching software on his phone, we saw 2 real towers and 4 fakes. Reply Bill Mitchell says: May 11, 2016 at 7:33 pm One answer would be to halt any sales of mobile phones by any manufacturer or mobile service provider until ALL bugs are patched. The idea that you probably have a phone that is not supported is just bad anyway you look at it. Consumers need better protection and deserve it. Reply Paul Adams says: May 12, 2016 at 10:07 am You will never know whether all bugs are patched, so you are stopping the sale of products that use software! Reply Paul Ducklin says: May 12, 2016 at 10:13 am I guess the OP meant “known bugs.” Reply Laurence Marks says: May 11, 2016 at 8:12 pm Wish they would have contacted the “cookie-cutter” tablet manufacturers too. Those folks are even worse than the cell phone manufacturers and carriers. Reply Brian T. Nakamoto says: May 11, 2016 at 9:22 pm It’d be nice if Apple added the last software updates available to the devices—particularly Macs—listed on their “Vintage and obsolete products” page. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624 I suppose one could back it out from the “Apple security updates” page… https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222 Reply Mistersaxon says: May 12, 2016 at 7:33 am That last paragraph though – “please provide a list of exploitable backdoor holes for us that we can compare to the ones we have discovered for ourselves and/or bought from commercial hacking firms” Reply Anonymous says: May 12, 2016 at 9:57 am Agree updates are essential. I have an Sony android phone that I have lost confidence in due to the updates issue – not sure I would purchase another android device. I have issues with Apples walled garden but at least regular updates appear. Reply Kenneth Porter says: August 10, 2016 at 12:04 am Require that phones be able to use 3rd party firmware, so we can keep getting updates from 3rd parties (like CyangenMod) when the original vendor (say, Verizon) has dropped support for an older phone.

Now you can Google it! 17 Apr 2015 14 Data loss, Google, Mobile, Security threats Post navigation Previous: Get into RSA 2015 for free, hear eye-opening talks! Next: Practical IT: What you need to know about email encryption by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Oh, drat. Your Android’s missing. How do you find it? Well, you could use Android Device Manager to locate it, reset its screen lock PIN and/or erase all the data, but that’s a bit of a hunt-menu-select-select scramble unto itself. Now, Google’s making it as simple as plugging a search term into its omnivorous search box. In fact, Google’s new “Find My Phone” is just that: a search term that we can now plug into Google search. All you have to do is make sure you’ve got the most recent version of the Google app installed on the device, Google said in a blog posting: We've all been there — you’ve searched under your car seat, tossed around the sofa cushions and you still can’t find your phone. If you know where your computer is, you can now ask Google to find your Android phone from your desktop. If the pesky phone is hiding nearby, Google can ring it for you — or you can see it on the map if you, say, forgot it at the bar. Just make sure you’ve got the latest version of the Google app installed on your device! After you plug in the “Find My Phone” search term, Google Maps comes up, and Google asks for permission to use your location data. A drop-down menu lets you select which device you’re trying to find, then Google communicates with the phone, eventually presenting a map view of its location that the company says is accurate to 76 feet (at least, that’s the accuracy it gave me for mine): Then, Google gives you the option of making the phone ring its head off, non-stop, at full volume, for 5 minutes, or until you press the power button. It’s always a relief to find your phone’s been hiding under a cushion. But what if your phone instead winds up in the pocket of a thief? Or what if an innocent person picks it up where you left it at the beach or the pub? When it’s in the hands of others, a phone can be the key that unlocks your privacy, given all the personal data it contains, including contacts, naked selfies, Facebook posts, online banking, Snapchats, Amazon purchases and, well, the sky’s the limit. To battle phone-related crime, US law enforcers and politicians have pushed for a mandatory kill switch – i.e., remote-control technology that bricks a phone after it’s stolen, thereby ruining its resale value. Short of a kill switch, there are ways to locate, lock and/or erase a wireless gadget if it gets lost or stolen, Google Device Manager being one. The telecom industry lobbying group CTIA has listings for security remote-command apps for Android, Blackberry, iOS (Apple), Symbian and Windows, as well as instructions on locking a phone BEFORE it’s stolen. Apple, for its part, introduced an activation lock in its iOS 7 mobile operating system. Apple previously had a Find My iPhone feature, but the activation lock took it a step further by not only tracking the lost phone but also enabling users to remotely wipe it. This approach isn’t as drastic as bricking it forever and ever. That’s a good thing, given that a locked iPhone can still display messages if the true owner lucks out and his or her device falls into the hands of a reputable person. Like this guy, who found a lady’s phone on a beach and accidentally posted a selfie to her Facebook account with it! (Happy ending: iPhone + owner = reunited!) Sophos is looking out for happy endings, too: it has a free Mobile Security app for Android that offers a bunch of remote commands you can send to your phone, including Wipe, Lock, Alarm, Locate, Reset passcode, and Message to finder. It also reports the device’s location before the battery runs out, and it provides notification if the SIM card is replaced.

Oh Hell No! So how do I remove this frigging security risk from my phone? I haven’t figured that out yet, and Google, so far, is of no help. How to stop my Google accounts from tracking my phone? Settings – Personal – Accounts – Google – Location Settings. It turns all Google accounts on or off. You can’t just pick one account. How do I stop my Google accounts from wiping my phone? I’m not sure, but it looks like: Settings – Security – Device Administrators – Click on Android Device Manager – Deactivate. Now Google Maps and Google My Tracks isn’t working. HELP.

Reply Lisa Vaas says: April 19, 2015 at 3:01 pm Forgive me if I’m misinterpreting what you wrote, but it sounds like you installed Android Device Manager and then realized that if one of your Google accounts was compromised, your phone could be wiped by the marauder… right? I can’t find a method of uninstalling Device Manager, but you could of course turn off the remote lock/wipe options on the phone: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3265955?hl=en As far as your Google accounts getting compromised goes, it’s a good idea to turn on 2-step verification. https://www.google.com/landing/2step/ I hope that helps…?

Reply Paul Ducklin says: April 18, 2015 at 9:34 am Or the recent Wi-Fi access points it’s seen…they’re also a good source of geolocation data. (The MAC address of an access point generally tells you the vendor; if it’s not a phone, its loction is probably fixed. So, once someone who does have GPS on their phone has seen that access point, and called home with its location, the access point itself becomes a location beacon :-) Reply Lisa Vaas says: April 19, 2015 at 2:50 pm It hasn’t been able to locate my phone unless I turn on Location. Which, obviously, I can’t do if I’ve lost it. Like many people, I turn off location unless I’m using Maps for some reason… Reply Paranoid Android says: April 18, 2015 at 9:23 am Slightly different issue: My Android tablet “failed” on me and I was faced with returning it to the retailer. Now since it “was not working”, whilst I could *send* a “wipe command”, it could not have acted on it (because it was not working!). So it goes back to some workshop somewhere and they get it working and they can then access everything at their leisure? Does a “wipe command” just keep trying and how does it know it has succeeded if the device whilst being wifi enabled is not 3G/4G connected? Fortunately, the retailer managed to reset it for me with the equivalent of the PC Ctrl-alt-del which I did not know about (power button plus sound down button for 30 seconds). And don’t say RTFM there is no FM!

Think of it like the twice-a-year fire drill you do at work. Seems boring at the time, but having a good idea of what it’s like to descend the fire escape in the dark is actually excellent practice.

How am I going to get the code that that google sends to the phone in order to authenticate if I don’t have my phone to begin with? Reply Anonymous says: August 10, 2016 at 2:25 am My thoughts exactly! You can print out a list of one time codes which you would most likely store in your wallet. So if someone steals your wallet and phone I guess you’d have to wait the 3-5 days to your account back and wouldn’t be able to track your phone until then.

If you reckon you've got what it takes to join the Doodler gang, take a look at the job spec. For the rest of us, here are the Mirror's top 5 Google Doodles of all time: 1. Charles Perrault's 388th birthday Are you a fan of Puss in Boots or Sleeping Beauty? Thank Charles Perrault (Photo: Google) Frenchman Charles Perrault only became a writer after losing his job at the age of 67. He went from being a civil servant to specialising in children's stories. His timeless work has been retold by everyone from Walt Disney to the Brothers Grimm. 2. 245th anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven's baptism Some of Beethoven's best work - like Für Elise and the Moonlight Sonata - was inspired by heartbreak (Photo: Google) Ludwig van Beethoven is one of the most famous and influential composers of all time. He is best known for his nine symphonies, which have been described as the "cornerstones of Western civilisation." He was taken out of school at just ten years old, to make money from his musical talent. 3. 162nd birthday of Hertha Marks Ayrton Hampshire-born Marks registered 26 patents between 1884 and her death in 1923 (Photo: Google) Marks was a celebrated engineer, physicist and inventor. She was awarded the Hughes Medal in 1906 by the Royal Society for her work on electric arcs and ripples in sand and water. Lydia Nichols’ doodle shows Ayrton framed by her breakthrough findings. 4. 126th anniversary of Eiffel Tower opening The 1,063 ft tall tower was constructed in early 1889 as the entrance arch to that year's World's Fair (Photo: Google) The doodle features a crew of cheery Gallic workmen busying themselves among the wrought iron girders high above the City of Light. One of the tradesmen has a full beard while another sports an impressively bushy handlebar moustache. Another can be seen with the ubiquitous beret perched atop his head while a colleague applies paint to the structure while wearing a functional par of dungarees. 5. Inge Lehmann's 127th birthday The pioneering female seismologist was born in Copenhagen in 1888 and became an earthquake expert (Photo: Google) The moving doodle depicts the Earth split into two with the core shining brightly from inside. In 1971, Lehmann was awarded the highest honour of the American Geophysical Union, the William Bowie medal in 1971. At the time, she was described as “the master of a black art for which no amount of computerising is likely to be a complete substitute.” Read More Google Doodles Charles Perrault Mountain of Butterflies Sophie Taeuber Pandit Ravi Shankar BKS Iyengar Clara Rockmore Wilbur Scoville George Boole Ludwig van Beethoven Hertha Marks Ayrton Eiffel Tower Opening Inge Lehmann Halloween game Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Mary Seacole Sir Frederick Banting Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Google Google doodles tech all Most Read Most Recent TechnologyThousands of women confess to wanting virtual reality SEX as techy toys become mainstream Over two thousand British women have given their thoughts on the ways technology will improve their sexual fulfillment Black FridayBest tech Black Friday deals 2016: Our pick of the top UK offers on gadgets, gaming and consumer electronics Black Friday takes place on November 25 - here are some of this year's best tech bargains Black FridayWhere to find the best Playstation deals online on Black Friday 2016 Have you got your eye on anything in particular for Black Friday?

Send questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU Austria Vienna’s Erich Obermayer races John Hollins during the 1982 Rotterdam tournament match against Arsenal, bearing the cigarette brand ‘Memphis’ on his shirt. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images Guardian sport Wednesday 10 August 2016 05.15 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 10 August 2016 05.17 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close “Has a club ever had a cigarette brand as a shirt sponsor?” tweets Nick Hayhoe. “Google can’t find one.” Google? Pah! Who needs a multi-billion dollar search engine when you’ve got the Knowledge on hand. Where Google failed, Knowledge readers have succeeded in unearthing several cigarette-based shirt sponsorship deals. First to central Europe. “Austria Vienna had a partnership with the Austrian tobacco company ‘Austria Tabak’ from 1977 to 2004,” writes Michael Gahler. “As a consequence they had the Austrian cigarette brand ‘Memphis’ as the main sponsor on their shirt. They were also renamed to Austria Memphis in 1977. They had Memphis in their official club name until 2004 when a new law prohibited them from having a cigarette brand as a sponsor.” Dale Pyatt emails in with pictorial evidence of FK Saravejo’s sponsorship. “At least they had a couple of excuses, though,” he writes. “One: nearly everyone in the city was so traumatised by the war that almost nobody over the age of three didn’t smoke. Two: thousands of the city’s jobs were, as a direct result, dependent on the Aura cigarette factory. No similarly mitigating circumstances justify the ubiquitous sponsorship of top-flight UK clubs by betting/payday-loan sharks. “When I attended a FK Sarajevo match back in the day, I had a flashback of a ‘Billy the Fish’ cartoon from Viz, in which the advertising hoardings showed two messages side by side: ‘Smoke tabs’ and ‘Government Health Warning: Don’t Smoke Tabs’. There were anti-smoking messages everywhere in Bosnia, but absolutely nobody paid any attention to them, and cigarette companies were just about the only ones with sufficient economic resources to sponsor sports clubs.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest FK Sarajevo shirt, circa 2003. Photograph: Dale Pyatt And the cigarette sponsorship arrangements sometimes went beyond shirts. English cricket had the Benson & Hedges Cup, Colombian football had the Copa Mustang. “I can offer you not only a team being sponsored by a cigarette brand but a whole league,” writes our very own Euclides Montes. “To Colombia, where the league had been cancelled following the killing of a referee in 1989 during the bad days of the drug wars. Enter Mustang cigarettes, who decided they could be the flag-bearers for the wholesome and family-friendly message of unity in football and entered into a fruitful agreement with the league, rebranding it Copa Mustang. Football transfer records broken by teams outside the top division | The Knowledge Read more “It was by all accounts a successful partnership that lasted well into the 21st century. It wasn’t until 2009 that the pesky anti-smoking brigade finally managed to bring in a law against tobacco advertising. So the league is now sponsored by the leading national brand of beer instead. Ho hum! Mustang did manage to squeeze in a shirt sponsorship before their scheme ran out of puff, when during a six-month period in 2002, the brand graced the kits of Millonarios FC (that’s the Millonarios of Di Stefano and Goycochea fame).” Meanwhile, sponsorship in Indonesia led to some very oddly named competitions. “Indonesian football (sadly) has a very close relationship with the tobacco industry,” writes Adi Prasatya. “When our pro league system was rebooted in the mid-90s, the league’s main sponsor was Bentoel, a local tobacco giant. The inaugural season in 1994 was named ‘Liga Dunhill’, a cigarette brand distributed by Bentoel. As part of the sponsorship deal, all clubs must put the Dunhill logo in front of their shirts. “Dunhill lasted for two seasons, and for the third season Bentoel used the league to hawk their Kansas-brand cigarettes, which resulted in the ridiculously named Liga Kansas – no relation whatsoever with the heartland of America. Bentoel has since been acquired by the British American Tobacco. The league is no longer sponsored by the tobacco industry, but their grip on the football scene remains strong. You cannot watch a football game on TV without seeing a cigarette ad.” But the relationship was not all one way. As Ben Marlow writes to point out, West Brom displayed an anti-smoking symbol on their shirts during the 1985-86 season and John Terry has (inadvertently) been involved in the anti-smoking message. Facebook Twitter Pinterest West Brom’s squad for the 1985-86 season pose for a team photograph with their anti-smoking symbols. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images Teams playing under another’s crest Last week Giorgi Pirtskhelani emailed from Tbilisi, Georgia, with a photo from the 1997 top-flight meeting between city rivals Dinamo and Locomotive. “As we see, Locomotive are wearing Manchester City’s 1994-96 away shirt and they played with it for the whole season. There was another case, as well; Tbilisi-based club Merani 91 wore Sheffield Wednesday’s 1995-96 away shirt. I wonder if there are similar cases when one team plays under another’s crest?” We touched on this subject to some extent before when we looked at teams who have to borrow their opponent’s kit. Teams wearing seemingly random kits of other sides seems to be a rarer occurrence, although there are some examples. Which teams have had to wear their opponents' kit? | The Knowledge Read more “In the 1972-73 season, the north-east’s lower-division needle match, Darlington v Hartlepool, was held as usual at Feethams, with the Quakers in their usual white and black kit, and Hartlepool in blue (though not stripes on this occasion),” writes Simon Atkinson. “A close inspection of the badge on the visitors’ shirts, however, revealed a very familiar sight though not in that context. Yes, a lion rampant, the letters ‘CFC’ and the detail: ‘League Cup Final 1972.’ “The reason was that a fire at the Victoria Ground had destroyed a lot of Hartlepool’s kit. Chelsea had taken pity and kindly donated a set of shirts. Having lost that final, of course, Chelsea probably couldn’t get rid of them quickly enough, though the name of the recipient’s ground would have been a bitter reminder since the winners at Wembley had been Stoke City, then of another Victoria Ground.” And here’s a tale from Ian Williams: “In 2005, in the African Champions League, ASFA Yennenga of Burkina Faso turned up in Cape Town to play Ajax. Now, Ajax’s kit is pretty iconic. And Yennenga’s home kit has always been yellow and green, so far as I can determine. But they pitched up with a red away kit. With less than 24 hours to go, they realised they needed a kit, but by this time it was Saturday afternoon, and most sports shops were closed. “No problem – we are a tourist city after all, and South Africa was earmarked to host the 2010 World Cup, so buying a dozen Bafana Bafana shirts proved pretty easy. Slap on a set of numbers, good to go. But some genius decided that playing with the SA badge and flag was bad luck for the Burkinabe. So went to work with a marker pen, and scribbled over both national symbols. Cue outrage from Safa.” Four off? No bother “Recently on Fifa, I managed to guide Real Zaragoza to a 2-1 home win against Barcelona with just nine men,” taps Kevin Leonard. “This got me wondering, what is the most red cards a team has ever had in a single game and still gone on to win?” Drum roll: we think we have a winner. In 2005 Grêmio, under the future Brazil coach Mano Menezes, won an astonishing promotion play-off against Nautico despite being reduced to seven (S-E-V-E-N) men when four of their players were sent off. The only goal was scored by future Manchester United tub Anderson, while Nautico missed two penalties. You can read more about it here. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Knowledge archive “On-loan Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard has just scored four goals on his debut for Birmingham,” wrote Jon Porter-Hughes in 2013. “Has there ever been a more prolific debutant?” It turns out that high-scoring debuts are not quite so uncommon as you would think: just the month before, there was at least a hat-trick of players who scored hat-tricks on their debuts. Fredy Montero, for instance, on loan from Seattle Sounders, scored three as Sporting Lisbon beat FC Arouca 5-1. In the Bundesliga, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang marked his debut for Borussia Dortmund with three goals in a 4-0 win against Augsburg, and not a scuffer among them. In the Eredivisie, meanwhile, Zakaria Bakkali started life at PSV’s Philips Stadion with a trio of goals against NEC Nijmegen (and funnily enough, another PSV player, Jürgen Locadia, scored a hat-trick on his league debut last season). Footballers playing in major international finals after club relegations | The Knowledge Read more They add their names to a list that includes the likes of Fabrizio Ravenelli, who put three past Liverpool on his Middlesbrough debut at the start of the 1996-97 season (by the way, John Barnes’s goal in that game is delightful); Wayne Rooney, who scored three against Fenerbahce on his Manchester United debut nine years ago, and none of them from closer than 18 yards; and Alan Shearer, who had previously come on as a sub for Southampton but made his full debut against Arsenal and scored three of the four goals that secured Southampton victory in April 1988. It made him the youngest player ever to score a top-flight hat-trick. These three-goal slackers obviously didn’t match Lingard’s feat, but there are those who have. Earlier in 2013, as the German club Energie Cottbus began their pre-season schedule, Charles Takyi made his debut in a 17-1 drubbing of Mullroser and scored four goals before being replaced at half-time. Perhaps it doesn’t really count, but for the sake of completeness, you should also know about Patrick Weihrauch, who was – at the time of writing – yet to play a competitive match for Bayern Munich but scored four when he played in their sharpener against a Wildenau Weiden Fans XI. And while we’re on training matches, we ought to nod to Emmanuel Ake, who stayed in Denmark in February 2012 just about long enough to score five goals on debut for Svebolle, who beat Frederiksberg 7-4 that day. Flicking back through the archives, we found a few further examples, all of them from bona fide competitive matches to boot. First to St James’ Park, where on the first day of the 1989-90 season Micky Quinn, top scorer for relegated Portsmouth the season before, marked his arrival with four goals in Newcastle’s 5-2 win over Leeds United. The visitors actually took a 2-1 lead after Quinn had opened the scoring from the penalty spot, but the tide turned in the second half. The crowd were beside themselves by the time Quinn ran through an exposed Leeds defence to slot his fourth past Mervyn Day. “Oh my word, it’s that man Quinn again!” This would become a recurring phrase that season, as Quinn scored 34 league goals and 39 in all competitions. Now to Turf Moor, January 1957, where a 17-year-old Ian Lawson was about to make his debut for Burnley in an FA Cup third-round match against Chesterfield. Within four minutes of kick-off, Lawson had given Burnley the lead and with the last kick of the game he scored his fourth to round off a thumping 7-0 win. In the next round, by the way, Burnley beat New Brighton 9-0, with Lawson scoring another three. And, finally, all the way back to November 1934, where Arthur Milne celebrated his move from Brechin Vics to Dundee United with four goals in United’s 9-6 league win over Edinburgh City. In his three years at the club he scored 85 goals in 81 games. • For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive. Can you help? “The recent Joy of Six regarding pitches reminded me of a story when Wales where playing a friendly against Brazil and narrowed the pitch before the game to counter the threat of the Brazilian wingers. However, I can’t seem to find any evidence of this happening, can anyone collaborate this, or is it a case of my overactive imagination?” asks James Hamilton. “So Liverpool recently signed Alex Manninger, 14 years after he left Arsenal,” notes Michael Britton. “Is this the longest break a player has had in between Premier League stints?” “Back in the day on Championship Manager (99-00 I think), Alan Shearer managed to play 39 Premier League games in a season without any 39th game happening,” writes Justin. “He did this by moving from Newcastle to Man Utd mid season when his new team had a game in hand over his old team. He thus managed to play 39 games by playing every game available for both teams before and after his move. My question then is whether something like this has happened in real life and by how many games extra has a player played?” “The Republic of Ireland wound up their Euro 1980 qualifying group on 6 February 1980 with a 2-0 defeat to England at Wembley (England had already sealed their place in the finals the previous November),” writes Oliver Farry. “Just six weeks later Ireland got their (heroic but ultimately unsuccessful) qualifying campaign for World Cup 1982 under way with a 3-2 win in Cyprus. Is this the shortest gap ever between qualifying campaigns?” Andrew Toothill (@ARToothill) @TheKnowledge_GU Victor Giro has 'PC' on the back of his shirt.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 08:24, Thu, Aug 11, 2016 GOOGLE • GETTY • EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSGoogle Maps now lets you save maps and directions for offline viewing, saving data and battery life Google has announced another update for its hugely-successful Google Maps app. The US search firm has included a slew of new features that should prove popular with those looking to save money or mobile data. It should also dramatically improve navigating in areas without a solid mobile internet connection. The headline new feature is Wifi-Only mode, which limits the app to offline files only when connected to 3G or 4G, could save you battery life, too. WiFi Only mode replaces Offline Areas in the Settings menu. Google Maps (which recently revealed the UK's best kept secret) will never use any mobile data – even when you are outside an area downloaded and saved to your device. Instead it will only connect to the internet and load any missing parts of the map when you are connected to a wifi network. GOOGLEWiFi Only mode can be easily activated with a toggle in the settings menu within the app Previously with the Offline Areas mode, Google Maps would stop using pre-loaded maps as soon as it got a whiff of mobile signal. That means it would continue to chomp through your mobile data plan, unless your device was set to Aeroplane Mode. We’ve all been through this – you need to get directions, but you don’t have service. Or you do have service – but it’s spotty Amanda Bishop, Google Maps Product Manager WiFi Only mode can be easily activated with a toggle in the settings menu within the app. Google announced the new addition on its official blog, writing: "We’ve all been through this – whether in our own backyard or a different country. "You need to get directions, but you don’t have service. Or you do have service – but it’s spotty – so you find yourself staring at the map in a perpetual state of loading while you sit in your car waiting to find out which way to go. "Now, when you know you’ll have spotty service or just want to save on data, you can toggle to “Wi-fi only” to use Google Maps entirely offline on Android.  "And the best part is that you can still use other apps and the rest of your phone as you normally would. You might even save on battery life too." GOOGLEGoogle started with including Uber prices, but now includes a swathe of other ride providers Elsewhere, the new version of Google Maps also adds the ability to save offline files to external storage. That means those with additional microSD storage will be able to save their in-built storage for apps by offloading their saved maps to the external memory. Google will let users choose between internal and external storage before a map is saved for offline viewing. The amount of available MBs on each device will also be presented before Google Maps users choose between the two storage locations.

Finally, the latest update to Google Maps also improves the integration of ride service tools. Google has added support for GO-JEK, Grab, Gett, Hailo, and MyTaxi in cities throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Poland, Italy, Austria, Russia, and Israel. Google Maps Product Manager, Amanda Bishop said: "Commuting around your own city can be a battle and navigating around a foreign land can be ten times tougher. "Using Google Maps offline and comparing between ride service options help make it a little easier so you can spend more time living and less time figuring out how to get places." The news comes as Google hinted at plans to accurately predict how long drivers can expect to drive around the block waiting for a parking space to open-up at their destination. According to clues in the latest beta release, the world's most popular navigation app could be set to include text-based alerts that informs you about any potential parking shortages. Google won't be actively tracking the status of each parking space. Instead, the data appears to be a guesstimate based on the total number of spaces, and the number of vehicles in the area, while also taking into account contextual information – like the time of day, whether or not there is a nearby sell-out sporting event or music concert. Still, it should give those without local knowledge a rough idea about the state of parking at their chosen destination.

News World Google worker Vanessa Marcotte's father speaks out after daughter found dead and stripped naked in woods Tom Powell Wednesday 10 August 2016 08:52 BST Concerned: police are advising caution after 'horrible' murder of Vanessa Marcotte The father of a Google employee found dead and stripped naked after going for a jog has issued an appeal to track down her killer. John Marcotte, 64, has spoken out about the pain of losing his only child Vanessa, 27, in a “horrible set of circumstances”. He said: “How can anything ever be alright again when your only child has been horribly murdered?” “I ask people to pray that whoever did this is caught. She was the best kid in the world. Read more Google employee Vanessa Marcotte found dead after going jogging in woods “She was 100 per cent into her job. She graduated top of her class. She knew how smart she was.” Ms Marcotte, who worked for Google in New York City, was last seen at 1pm on Sunday when she went for a run in the woods near her mother’s house in Massachusetts. Her body was found by police with sniffer dogs at 8pm the same day, with burns on her hands and feet. Police are also investigating a sexual assault. District Attorney Joseph Early said: “People should be concerned, we are asking them to use an abundance of caution. Much-loved: Ms Marcotte worked for Google in New York City and enjoyed sports “We have a horrible set of facts, horrible set of circumstances and we are going to do everything we can to make sure that this investigation is carried out.” A Google spokesman said: “Vanessa Marcotte was a much-loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports. “We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends.” It comes just a week after a similar murder in New York City, where Karina Vetrano, 30, was found sexually assaulted and strangled near her home after going for a run. Her mother Cathy had a message for the fugitive killer at a press conference on Sunday, stating: “I guarantee you – you will pay forever.” Mr Early said there is “nothing at this point” to connect the murder to that of Ms Vetrano last week, who was also killed while jogging near her home in Queens, New York.

Say What!? Previous Reinventing SEO Next Brands Beat Generics Neofeudal Web Publishing Best Practices Guide At the abstract level, if many people believe in something then it will grow. The opposite is also true. And in a limitless, virtual world, you can not see what is not there. The Yahoo Directory Before I got into search, the Yahoo! Directory was so important to the field of search there were entire sessions at SES conferences on how to get listed & people would even recommend using #1AAA-widgets.com styled domains to alphaspam listings to the top of the category. The alphaspam technique was a carry over from yellow page directories - many of which have went through bankruptcy as attention & advertising shifted to the web. Go to visit the Yahoo! Directory today and you get either a server error, a security certificate warning, or a redirect to aabacosmallbusiness.com. Poof. It's gone. Before the Yahoo! Directory disappeared their quality standards were vastly diminished. As a webmaster who likes to test things, I tried submitting sites of various size and quality to different places. Some sites which would get rejected by some $10 directories were approved in the Yahoo! Directory. The Yahoo! Directory also had a somewhat weird setting where if you canceled a directory listing in the middle of the term they would often keep it listed for many years to come - for free. After many SEOs became fearful of links the directory saw vastly reduced rates of submissions & many existing listings canceled their subscriptions, thus leaving it as a service without much of a business model. DMOZ At one point Google's webmaster guidelines recommended submitting to DMOZ and the Yahoo! Directory, but that recommendation led to many lesser directories sprouting up & every few years Google would play a whack-a-mole game and strip PageRank or stop indexing many of them. Many have presumed DMOZ was on its last legs many times over the past decade. But on their 18th birthday they did a spiffy new redesign. Different sections of the site use different color coding and the design looks rather fresh and inviting. Take a look. However improved the design is, it is unlikely to reverse this ranking trend. Lacking Engagement Why did those rankings decline though? Was it because the sites suck? Or was it because the criteria to rank changed? If the sites were good for many years it is hard to believe the quality of the sites all declined drastically in parallel. What happened is as engagement metrics started getting folded in, sites that only point you to other sites become an unneeded step in the conversion funnel, in much the same way that Google scrubbed affiliates from the AdWords ecosystem as unneeded duplication. What is wrong with the user experience of a general web directory? There isn't any single factor, but a combination of them... the breadth of general directories means their depth must necessarily be limited. general directory category pages ranking in search results is like search results in search results. it isn't great from the user's perspective. if a user already knows a category well they would likely prefer to visit a destination site rather than a category page. if a user doesn't already know a category, then they would prefer to use an information source which prioritizes listing the best results first. the layout for most general web directories is a list of results which are typically in alphabetical order rather than displaying the best result first in order to sound authoritative many directories prefer to use a neutral tone If a directory mostly links to lower quality sites Google can choose to either not index it or not trust links from it. And even if a directory generally links to trustworthy sites, Google doesn't need to rank it to extract most the value from it. The trend of lower traffic to the top tier general directory sites has happened across the board. Many years ago Google's remote rater guidelines cited Joeant as a trustworthy directory. Their traffic chart looks like this. And the same sort of trend is true for BOTW, Business.com, GoGuides.org, etc. There is basically nothing a general web directory can do to rank well in Google on a sustainable basis, at least not in the English language. Even if you list every school in the city of Winnipeg that page can't rank if it isn't indexed & even if it is indexed it won't rank well if your site has a Panda-related ranking issue. There are a couple other issues with such a comprehensive page: each additional listing is more editorial content cost in terms of building the page AND maintaining the page the bigger the page gets the more a user needs something other than alphabetical order as a sort option the more listings there are in a tight category the more the likelihood there will be excessive keyword repetition on the page which could get the page flagged for algorithmic demotion, even if the publisher has no intent to spam. Simply listing things by their name will mean repeating a word like "school" over 100 times on the above linked Winnipeg schools page. If you don't consciously attempt to lower the count a page like that could have the term repeated over 300 times. Knock On Effects In addition to those web directories getting fewer paid submissions, most are likely seeing a rise in link removal requests. Google's "fear first" approach to relevancy has even led them to listing DMOZ as an unnatural link source in warning emails to webmasters. What's more, many people who use automated link clean up tools take the declining traffic charts & low rankings of the sites as proof that the links lack value or quality. That means anyone who gets hit by a penalty & ends up in warning messages not only ends up with less traffic while penalized, but they also get extra busy work to do while trying to fix whatever the core problem is. And in many cases fixing the core problem is simply unfeasible without a business model change. When general web directories are defunded it not only causes many of them to go away, but it also means other related sites and services disappear. Editors of those web directories who were paid to list quality sites for free. Web directory review sites. SEOs, internet marketers & other businesses which listed in those directories Now perhaps general web directories no longer really add much value to the web & they are largely unneeded. But there are other things which are disappearing in parallel which were certainly differentiated & valuable, though perhaps not profitable enough to maintain the "relevancy" footprint to compete in a brand-first search ecosystem. Depth vs Breadth Unless you are the default search engine (Google) or the default social network everyone is on (Facebook), you can't be all things to all people. If you want to be differentiated in a way that turns you into a destination you can't compete on a similar feature set because it is unlikely you will be able to pay as much for traffic-driven partnerships as the biggest players can. Can niche directories or vertical directories still rank well? Sure, why not. Sites like Yelp & TripAdvisor have succeeded in part by adding interactive elements which turned them into sought after destinations. Part of becoming a destination is intentionally going out of their way to *NOT* be neutral platforms. Consider how many times Yelp has been sued by businesses which claimed the sales team did or was going to manipulate the displayed reviews if the business did not buy ads. Users tend to trust those platforms precisely because other users may leave negative reviews & that (usually) offers something better than a neutral and objective editorial tone. And that user demand for those reviews, of course, is why Google stole reviews from those sorts of sites to try to prop up the Google local places pages. It was a point of differentiation which was strong enough that people wanted it over Google. So Google tried to neutralize the advantage. Blogs The above section is about general directories, but the same concept applies to almost any type of website. Consider blogs. A decade ago feed readers were commonplace, bloggers often cross-linked & bloggers largely drove the conversation which bubbled up through mainstream media. Google Reader killed off RSS feed readers by creating a fast, free & ad-free competitor. Then Google abruptly shut down Google Reader. Not only do whimsical blogs like Least Helpful or Cute Overload arbitrarily shut down, but people like Chris Pirillo who know tech well suggest blogging is (at least economically) dead. Many of the people who are quitting are not the dumb, the lazy, and the undifferentiated. Rather many are the wise trend-aware players who are highly differentiated yet find it impossible to make the numbers work: The conversation started when revenues were down, and I had to carry payroll for a month or two out of my personal account, which I had not had to do since shortly after we started this whole project. We tweaked some things (added an ad or two which we had stripped back for the redesign, reminded people about ad-blockers and their impact on our ability to turn a profit, etc.) and revenue went back up a bit, but for a hot minute, you’ll remember I was like: “Theoretically, if this industry went further into the ground which it most assuredly will, would we want to keep running the site as a vanity project? Probably not! We would just stop doing it.” In the current market Google can conduct a public relations campaign on a topic like payday loans, have their PR go viral & then if you mention "oh yeah, so Google is funding the creation of doorway pages to promote payday loans" it goes absolutely nowhere, even if you do it DURING THE NEWS CYCLE. So much of what exists is fake that anything new is evaluated from the perception of suspicion. While the real (and important) news stories go nowhere & the PR distortions spread virally, the individual blogger ends up feeling a bit soulless if they try to make ends meet: "The American Mama reached tens of thousands of readers monthly, and under that name I worked with hundreds of big name brands on sponsored campaigns. I am a member of virtually every ‘blog network’ and agency that “connects brands with bloggers”. ... What’s the point of having your own space to write if you’re being paid to sound like you work for a corporation? ... PR Friendly says “For the right price, I will be anyone you want me to be.” ... I’m not saying blogging is dying, but this specific little monster branch of it, sponsored content disguised as horribly written “day in the life” stories about your kids and pets? It can’t possibly last. Do you really want to be stuck on the inside when it crumbles?" If you can't get your own site to grow enough to matter then maybe it makes sense to contribute to someone else's to get your name out there. I recently received this unsolicited email: "Hello! This is Theodore, a writer and chief editor at SomeSiteName.Com I noticed that you are accepting paid reviews online and you will be glad to know that now you can also publish your Sponsored content to SomeSite via me. SomeSite.Com is a leading website which deals in Technology, Social Media, Internet Stuff and Marketing. It was also tagged as Top 10 _____ websites of 2016 by [a popular magazine]. Website Stats- Alexa Rank: [below 700] Google PageRank: 6/10 Monthly Pageviews: 5+ Million Domain Authority: 85+ Price : $500 via PayPal (Once off Payment) Let me know if you are interested and want to feature your website product like nothing! This will not only increase your traffic but increase in overall SEO Score as well. Thanks" That person was not actually a member of that site's team, but they had found a way to get their content published on it. In part because that sort of stuff exists, Google tries to minimize the ability for reputation to flow across sites. The large platforms are so smug, so arrogant, they actually state the following sort of crap in interviews: "There's a space in the world for art, but that's different from trying to build products at scale. The one thing that does make me a little nervous is a lot of my designer friends are still focused building websites and I'm not sure that's a growth business anymore. If you look at people who are doing interesting work, they tend to be building inside these platforms like Facebook and finding ways to do interesting work in there. For instance, journalists. Instant Articles is a really great way for stories to be told." Sure you can bust your ass to build up Facebook, but when their business model changes (bye social gaming companies, hello live streaming video) best of luck trying to follow them. And if you starve during the 7 lean years in between when your business model is once again well aligned with Facebook you can't go back in time to give yourself a meal to un-starve. Content Farms Ehow.com has removed *MILLIONS* of pages of content since getting hit by Panda. And yet their ranking chart looks like this What is crazy is the above chart actually understates the actual declines, because the shift of search to mobile & increasing prevalence of ads in the search results means estimates of organic search traffic may be overstated significantly compared to a few years prior. A half-decade ago a bootstrapped eHow competitor named ArticlesBase got some buzz in TechCrunch because they were making about $500,000 a month on about 20 million monthly unique visitors. That business was recently listed on Flippa. They are getting about a half-million unique monthly visitors (off 95%) and about $2,000 a month in revenues (off about 99.6%). The negative karma with that site (in terms of ability to rank) is so bad that the site owner suggested on Flippa to publish any new content from new authors onto different websites: "its not going to get to 0 as most of the traffic is not google today, but we would suggest to push out the fresh daily incoming content to new sites - thats where the growth is." Now a person could say "eHow deserves to die" and maybe they are right. BUT one could easily counter that point by noting... the public who owns the shares owns the ongoing losses & many top insiders cashed out long ago Google was getting a VIG on eHow on their ride up & is still collecting one on the way down (along with funding other current parallel projects from the very same people with the very same Google ad network) Demand Media's partner program where they syndicate eHow-like content to newspapers like USA Today keeps growing at 15% to 20% a year (similar process, author, content, business model, etc. ... only a different URL hosting the content) look at this and you'll see how many publishing networks are still building the same sort of content but are cross-marketing across networks of sites. What's more some of the same names are at the new plays. For example, Demand Media's founder was the chairman of an SEO firm bought by Hearst publishing & his wife is on the about us page of Evolve Media's ModernMom.com The wrappers around the content & masthead logos change, but by and large the people and strategies don't change anywhere near as quickly. Web Portals & News Sites As the mainstream media gets more desperate, they are more willing to partner with the likes of Demand Media to get any revenue they can. You see the reality of this desperation in the stock charts for newspaper companies. Or how about this chart for Yahoo.com. It doesn't look particularly bad, especially if you consider that Yahoo has shut down many of their vertical sites. Underlying flat search traffic charts misses declining publisher CPMs and the click traffic mix shift away from organic toward paid search channels as search traffic shifts to mobile devices & Google relentlessly increases the size of the search ads. Yahoo may still rank #3 for keyword x, but if that #3 ranking is below the fold on both mobile and desktop devices they might need to rank #1 to get as much traffic as #3 got a couple years ago. Yahoo! was once the leading search portal & now they are worth about 1/5th of LinkedIn (after backing out their equity stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan). The chart is roughly flat, but the company is up for a fire sale because organic search result displacement & the value of traffic has declined quicker than Yahoo! can fire employees & none of their Hail Mary passes worked. Ms. Mayer compared the [Polyvore] deal to Google’s acquisition of YouTube in 2006, arguing that “you can never overpay” for a company with the potential to land a huge new base of users. ... “Her core mistake was this belief that she could reinvent Yahoo,” says a former senior executive who left the company last year. “There was an element of her being a true believer when everyone else had stopped.” The same line of thinking was used to justify the Tumblr acquisition, which has went nowhere fast - just like their 50+ other acquisitions. Yahoo! shut down many verticals, fired many workers, sold off some real estate & is exploring selling their patents. Chewing Up the Value Chain Smaller devices that are harder to use means the gateways have to try to add more features to maintain relevance. As they add features, publishers get displaced: The Web will only expand into more aspects of our lives. It will continue to change every industry, every company, and every life on the planet. The Web we build today will be the foundation for generations to come. It’s crucial we get this right. Do we want the experiences of the next billion Web users to be defined by open values of transparency and choice, or the siloed and opaque convenience of the walled garden giants dominating today? And if converting on mobile is hard or inconvenient, many people will shift to the defaults they know & trust, thus choosing to buy on Amazon rather than a smaller ecommerce website. One of my friends who was in ecommerce for many years stated this ultimately ended up becoming the problem with his business. People would email him back and forth about the product, related questions, and basically go all the way through the sales process with getting him to answer every concern & recommend each additional related product needed, then at the end they would ask him to price match Amazon & if he couldn't they would then buy from Amazon. If he had more scale he might have been able to get a better price from suppliers and compete with Amazon on price, but his largest competitor who took out warehouse space also filed for bankruptcy because they were unable to make the interest payments on their loans. We live in a society which over-values ease-of-use & scale while under-valuing expertise. Look at how much consolidation there has been in the travel market since Google Flights launched & Google went pay-to-play with hotel search. Expedia owns Travelocity & Orbitz. Priceline owns Kayak. Yahoo! Travel simply disappeared. TripAdvisor is strong, but even they were once a part of Expedia. How different are the remaining OTAs? One could easily argue they are less differentiated than this article about the history of the travel industry makes Skift against other travel-related news sites. How many markets are strong enough to support the creation of that sort of featured editorial content? Not many. And most companies which can create that sort of in-depth content leverage the higher margins on shallower & cheaper content to pay for that highly differentiated featured content creation. But if the knowledge graph and new search features are simply displacing the result set the number of people who will be able to afford creating that in-depth featured content is only further diminished. Over 5 years ago Bing's Stefan Weitz mentioned they wanted to move search from a web of nouns to a web of verbs & to "look at the web as a digital representation of the physical world." Some platforms are more inclusive than Google is & decide to partner rather than displace, but Bing's partnership with Yelp or TripAdvisor doesn't help you if you are a direct competitor of Yelp or TripAdvisor, or if your business was heavily reliant on one of these other channels & you fall out of favor with them. Chewing Up Real Estate There are so many enhanced result features in the search results it is hard to even attempt to make an exhaustive list. As search portals rush to add features they also rush to grab real estate & outright displace the concept of "10 blue links." There has perhaps been nothing which captured the sentiment better than .@mattcutts I think I have spotted one, Matt. Note the similarities in the content text: pic.twitter.com/uHux3rK57f— dan barker (@danbarker) February 27, 2014 The following is paraphrased, but captures the intent to displace the value chain & the roll of publishers. "the journeys of users. their desire to be taken and sort of led and encouraged to proceed, especially on mobile devices (but I wouldn't say only on mobile devices). ... there are a lot of users who are happy to be provided with encouragement and leads to more and more interesting information and related, grouped in groups, leading lets say from food to restaurants, from restaurants to particular types of restaurants, from particular types of restaurants to locations of those types of restaurants, ordering, reservations. I'm kind of hungry, and in a few minutes you've either ordered food or booked a table. Or I'm kind of bored, and in a few minutes you've found a book to read or a film to watch, or some other discovery you are interested in." - Andrey Lipattsev What role do publishers have in the above process? Unpaid data sources used to train algorithms at Facebook & Google? Individually each of these assistive search feature roll outs may sound compelling, but ultimately they defund publishing. Looks like Symptom Cards will lead to additional, more-focused searches (& not to third party sites.) #seo pic.twitter.com/vhkz5ZflMJ— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) June 20, 2016 Not a "Google Only" Problem People may think I am unnecessarily harsh toward Google in my views, but this sort of shift is not a Google-only thing. It is something all the large online platforms are doing. I simply give Google more coverage because they have a history of setting standards & moving the market, whereas a player like Yahoo! is acting out of desperation to simply try to stay alive. The market capitalization of the companies reflect this. Google & Facebook control the ecosystem. Everyone else is just following along. "digital is eating legacy media, mobile is eating digital, and two companies, Facebook and Google, are eating mobile. ... Since 2011, desktop advertising has fallen by about 10 percent, according to Pew. Meanwhile mobile advertising has grown by a factor of 30 ... Facebook and Google, control half of net mobile ad revenue." - Derek Thompson The same sort of behavior is happening in China, where Google & Facebook are prohibited from competing. As publishers get displaced and defunded online platforms can literally buy the media: “There’s very little downside. Even if we lose money it won’t be material,” Alibaba's Mr. Tsai said. “But the upside [in buying SCMP] is quite interesting.” The above quote was on Alibaba buying the newspaper of record in Hong Kong. As bad as entire industries becoming token purchases may sound, that is the optimistic view. :D Facebook's Instant Articles and Google's AMP those make a token purchase unnecessary: "I don't think it's any secret that you're going to see a bloodbath in the next 12 months," Vice Media's Shane Smith said, referring to digital media and broadcast TV. "Facebook has bought two-thirds of the media companies out there without spending a dime." Those services can dictate what gets exposure, how it is monetized, and then adjust the exposure and revenue sharing over time to keep partners desperate & keep them hooked. “If Thiel and Nick Denton were just a couple of rich guys fighting over a 1st Amendment edge case, it wouldn't be very interesting. But Silicon Valley has unprecedented, monopolistic power over the future of journalism. So much power that its moral philosophy matters.” - Nate Silver Give them just enough (false) hope to stay partnered. All the while track user data more granularly & run AI against it to disintermediate & devalue partners. TV networks are aware of the risks of disintermediation and view Netflix with more suspicion than informed SEOs view Google: for all the original shows Netflix has underwritten, it remains dependent on the very networks that fear its potential to destroy their longtime business model in the way that internet competitors undermined the newspaper and music industries. Now that so many entertainment companies see it as an existential threat, the question is whether Netflix can continue to thrive in the new TV universe that it has brought into being. ... “ ‘Breaking Bad’ was 10 times more popular once it started streaming on Netflix.” - Michael Nathanson ... the networks couldn’t walk away from the company either. Many of them needed licensing fees from Netflix to make up for the revenue they were losing as traditional viewership shrank. And just like Netflix, Facebook will move into original content production. The Wiki Wikipedia is certainly imperfect, but it is also a large part of why other directories have went away. It is basically a directory tied to an encyclopedia which is free and easy to syndicate. Every large search & discovery platform has an incentive for Wikipedia to be as expansive as possible. The bigger Wikipedia gets, the more potential answers and features can be sourced from it. More knowledge graph, more instant answers, more organic result displacement, more time on site, more ad clicks. Even if a knowledge graph listing is wrong, the harm done by it doesn't harm the search service syndicating the content unless people create a big deal of the error. But if that happens then people will give feedback on how to fix the error & that is a PR lead into the narrative of how quickly search is improving and evolving. "Wikipedia used to instruct its authors to check if content could be dis-intermediated by a simple rewrite, as part of the criteria for whether an article should be added to wikipedia. There are many rascals on the Internets; none deserving of respect." - John Andrews Sergy Brin donates to fund the expansion of Wikipedia. Wikipedia rewrites more webmaster content. Google has more knowledge graph grist and rich answers to further displace publishers. I recently saw the new gray desktop search results Google is tested. When those appear the knowledge graph appears inline with the regular search results & even on my huge monitor the organic result set is below the fold. The problem with that is if your brand name is the same brand name that is in the knowledge graph & you are not the dominant interpretation then you are below the fold on all devices for your core brand UNLESS you pay Google for every single click. How much should a brand like The Book of Life pay Google for being a roadblock? What sort of tax is appropriate & reasonable? How high will you bid in a casino where the house readjusts the shuffle & deal order in the middle of the hand? I recently did a search on Bing & inside their organic search results they linked to a Mahalo-like page called Bing Knows. I guess this is a feature in China, but it could certainly spread to other markets. If they partnered with an eBay or Amazon.com and put a "buy now" button in the search results they'd have just about completely closed the loop there. Broad Commodification The reason I started this article with directories is their role is to link to sites. They are categorized collections of links which have been heavily commodified & devalued to the point they are rendered unnecessary and viewed adversely by much of the SEO market (even the ones with decent editorial standards). Just like links got devalued, so did domain names. And, as mentioned above in the parts about blogging, content farms, web portals & news sites ... the same trend is happening to almost every type of content. Online ad revenues are still growing quickly, but they are not flowing through to old media & many former leading bloggers consider blogging dead. Big platform players like Google and Facebook broaden cross-device user tracking to create new relevancy signals and extract most the value created by publisher. The more information the platform owns the more of a starving artist the partners become. As partners become more desperate, they overvalue growth (just like Yahoo! with Polyvore): "It's the golden age right now," [Thrillist CEO Ben Lerer] said. "If you're a digital publisher, you have every big TV company calling you. When I look at media brands, if a media brand disappeared tomorrow, would I notice?" he said. "And there are a bunch of brands that have scale, and maybe a lot of money raised, and maybe this and that, but, actually, I might not know for a year. There's so many brands like that. Like, what does it really stand for? Why does it exist?" Disruption is not a strategy, but the whole point of accelerating it & pushing it (without an adequate plan for "what's next") is to re-establish feudal lords. The web is a virtual land where the commodity which matters most is attention. If you go back in time, lords maintained wealth & control through extracting rents. A few years ago a quote like the following one may have sounded bizarre or out of place These are the people who guard the company’s status as what ranking team head Amit Singhal often sees characterised as “the biggest kingmaker on this Earth.” But if you view it through the some historical context it isn't hard to understand "The nobles still had the power to write the law, and in a series of moves that took place in different countries at different times, they taxed the bazaar, broke up the guilds, outlawed local currencies, and bestowed monopoly charters on their favorite merchants. ... It was never really about efficiency anyway; industrialization was about restoring the power of those at the top by minimizing the value and price of human laborers." - Douglas Rushkoff Google funding LendUp & ranking their doorway pages while hitting the rest of the industry is Google bestowing "monopoly charters on their favorite merchants." Headwinds The issue is not that the value of anything drops to zero, but rather a combine set of factors shrinks down the size of the market which can be profitably served. Each of these factors eat at margins... lower CPMs the rise of ad blockers (funded largely by some big ad networks paying to allow their own ads through while blocking competing ad networks) rise of programmatic ads (which shift advertiser budget away from publisher to various forms of management) larger ad sizes: "Based on early testing, some advertisers have reported increases in clickthrough rates of up to 20% compared to current text ads. " increase of vertical search results in Google & more ads + self-hosted content in Facebook's feed shift of search audience to mobile devices which have no screen real estate for organic search results and lower cost per click (there's a reason Google AdSense is publishing tips on making more from mobile) increased algorithmic barrier to entry and longer delay times to rank The least sexy consultant pitch in the world: "Sure I can probably rank your website, but it will take a year or two, cost you at least $80,000 per year, and you will still be below the fold even if we get to #1 because the paid search ads fill up the first screen of results." That isn't going to be an appealing marketing message for a new small business with a limited budget. The Formula “The open web is pretty broken. ... Railroad, electricity, cable, telephone—all followed this similar pattern toward closedness and monopoly, and government regulated or not, it tends to happen because of the power of network effects and the economies of scale” - Ev Williams. The above article profiling Ev Williams also states: "An April report from the web-analytics company Parse.ly found that Google and Facebook, just two companies, send more than 80 percent of all traffic to news sites." The same general trend is happening to almost every form of content - video, news, social, etc.. a big platform over-promotes a vertical to speed up buy-in (perhaps even offering above market rates or other forms of compensation to get the flywheel started) other sources join the market without that compensation & then the compensation stream gets yanked displacement of the source by a watered down copy (eHow or Wikipedia styled rewrite), or some zero-cost licensing arrangement (Facebook Instant Articles, Google AMP, syndicating Wikipedia rewrites) strategic defunding of the content source promise of future gains causing desperate publishers to lean harder into Google or Facebook even as they squeeze more water out of the rock. Hey, sure your traffic is declining & your revenue is declining faster. You are getting squeezed out, but if you trust the primary players responsible for the shift & rely on Instant Articles or Google's AMP this time will be different. ...or maybe not... Facts & Opinions When I saw some Google shills syndicating Google's "you can't copyright facts" pitch without question I cringed, because I knew where that was immediately headed. A year later the trend was obvious. The Internet commoditized the distribution of facts. The "news" media responded by pivoting wholesale into opinions and entertainment.— Naval Ravikant (@naval) May 26, 2016 So now we get story pitches where the author tries to collect a few quote sources to match the narrative already in their head. Surely this has gone on for a long time, but it has rarely been so transparently obvious and cringeworthy as it is today. How modern journalism works pic.twitter.com/i2CRnwAWZy— Nick Cohen (@NickCohen4) June 15, 2016 And if you stray too far from facts into opinions & are successful, don't be surprised if you end up on the receiving end of proxy lawsuits: Can we talk about how strange it is for a group of Silicon Valley startup mentors to embrace secret proxy litigation as a business tactic? To suddenly get sanctimonious about what is published on the internet and called News? To shame another internet company for not following ‘the norms’ of a legacy industry? The hypocrisy is mind bending. The desperation is so bad news sites don't even attempt to hide it. And part of what is driving that is bot-driven content further eroding margins on legitimate publishing. Google not only ranks those advertorials, but they also promote some of the auto-generated articles which read like: As many as 1 analysts, the annual sales target for company name, Inc. (NYSE:ticker) stands at $45.13 and the median is $45.13 for the period closed 3. The bearish target on sales is $45.13 and the bullish estimate is $45.13, yielding a standard deviation of 1.276%. Not more than 1 investment entities have updated sales projections on upside over the last week while 1 have downgraded their previously provided sales targets. The estimates highlight a net change of 0% over the last 1 weeks period. Sales estimated amount is a foremost parameter in judging a firm’s performance. Nearly 1 analysts have revised sales number on the upside in last one month and 1 have lowered their targets. It demonstrates a net cumulative change of 0% in targets against sales forecasts which were given a month ago. In latest quarterly period, 1 have revised targeted sales on upside and 1 have decreased their projections. It demonstrates change of 4.898%. I changed a few words in each sentence of that quote to make it harder to find the source as I wasn't trying to out them specifically. But the auto-generated content was ranked by Google & monetized via inline Google AdSense ads promoting the best marijuana stocks to invest in and warning of a pending 80% stock market crash coming soon this year. Hey at least it isn't a TOTALLY fake story! Publishers get the message loud and clear. Tronc wants to ramp up on AI driven video content at scale: "There's all these really new, fun features we're going to be able to do with artificial intelligence and content to make videos faster," Ferro told interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin. "Right now, we're doing a couple hundred videos a day; we think we should be doing 2,000 videos a day." All is well, news & information are just externalities to a search engine ad network. No big deal. "With newspapers dying, I worry about the future of the republic. We don’t know yet what’s going to replace them, but we do already know it’s going to be bad." - Charlie Munger Build a Brand Build a brand, that way you are protected from the rapacious tech platforms. Or so the thinking goes. But that leads back to the above image where The Book of Life is below the fold on their own branded search query because there is another interpretation Google feels is more dominant. The big problem with "brand as solution" is you not only have to pay to build a brand, but then you have to pay to protect it. And the number of search "innovations" to try to siphon off some late funnel branded traffic and move it back up the funnel to competitors (to force the brand to pay again for their own brand to try to displace the "innovations") will only continue growing. And at any point in time if Disney makes a movie using your brand name as the name of the movie, you are irrelevant and need of a rebrand overnight, unless you commit to paying Google for your brand forever. Having an offline location can be a point of strength and a point of differentiation. But it can also be a reason for Google to re-route user traffic through more Google owned & controlled pages. Further, most large US offline retailers are doing horrible. Almost all the offline growth is in stores selling dirt cheap unbranded imported stuff like Dollar General or Family Dollar & stores like Ross and TJ Maxx which sell branded item remainders at discount prices. And as Amazon gets more efficient by the day, other competitors with high cost structures & less efficient operations grow relatively less efficient over time. The Wall Street Journal recently published an article about a rift between Wal-Mart & Procter & Gamble: “They sell crappy private label, so you buy Swiffer with a crappy refill,” said one of the people familiar with the product changes. “And then you don’t buy again.” In trying to drive sales growth, P&G is resorting to some Yahoo!-like desperate measures, included meetings where "Some workers donned gladiator-like armor for the occasion." Riding on other platforms or partners carries the same sorts of risks as trusting Google or Facebook too much. Even owning a strong brand name and offline distribution does not guarantee success. Sears already spun out their real estate & they are looking to sell the Kenmore & Craftsman brands. The big difference between the web and offline platforms is the marginal cost of information is zero, so they can quickly & cheaply spread to adjacent markets in ways that physically constrained offline players can not & some of the big web platforms have far more data on people than governments do. It is worth noting one of the things that came out of the Snowden leaks is spooks were leveraging Google's DoubleClick cookies for tracking users. As desperate stores/platforms see slowing growth they squeeze for margins and seek to accelerate growth any way possible. Chasing growth ultimately leads to the promise of what differentiates them disappearing. I recently bought some "hand crafted" soaps on Etsy, which shipped from Shenzen. I am not sure how that impacts other artisinal soap sellers, but it makes me less likely to buy that sort of product from Etsy again. And for as much as I like shopping on Amazon, I was uninspired when a seller recently sent me this. Amazon might usually be great for buyers & great for affiliates, but hearing how they are quickly expanding their private label offerings wouldn't be welcome news for a merchant who is overly-reliant on them for sales in any of those categories. The above sort of activity is what is going on in the real world even among brands which are not under attack. The domestic economic landscape is getting quite ugly: America’s economy today is in some respects more concentrated than it was during the Gilded Age, whose excesses prompted the Progressive Era reforms the FTC exemplifies. In sector after sector, from semiconductors and cable providers to eyeglass manufacturers and hotels, a handful of companies dominate. These giants use their market power to hike prices for consumers and suppress wages for workers, worsening inequality. Consolidation also appears to be driving a dramatic decline in entrepreneurship, closing off opportunity and suppressing growth. Concentration of economic power, in turn, tends to concentrate political power, which incumbents use to sway policies in their favor, further entrenching their dominance. And the local abusive tech monopolies are now firmly promoting the TPP: "make it more difficult for TPP countries to block Internet sites" = countries should have less influence over the web than individual Facebook or Google engineers do. In a land of algorithmic false positives that cause personal meltdowns and organizational breakdowns there is nothing wrong at all with that! I kept waiting. For a year and a half, I waited. The revenues kept trickling down. It was this long terrible process, losing half overnight but then also roughly 3% a month for a year and a half after. It got to the point where we couldn’t pay our bills. That’s when I reached out again to Matt Cutts, “Things never got better.” He was like, “What, really? I’m sorry.” He looked into it and was like, “Oh yeah, it never reversed. It should have. You were accidentally put in the bad pile.” Luckily the world can depend on China to drive growth and it will save us. Or maybe there is a small problem with that line of thinking... Beijing’s intellectual property regulator has ordered Apple Inc. to stop sales of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the city, ruling that the design is too similar to a Chinese phone, in another setback for the company in a key overseas market. Can any experts chime in on this? Let's see... First, there is Wal-Mart selling off their Chinese e-commerce operation to the #2 Chinese ecommerce company & then there's this from the top Chinese ecommerce company: “The problem is the fake products today are of better quality and better price than the real names. They are exactly the same factories, exactly the same raw materials but they do not use the names.” - Alibaba's Jack Ma Published: June 20, 2016 by Aaron Wall in publishing & media Previous Reinventing SEO Next Brands Beat Generics New to the site?

Say What!? Previous Brands Beat Generics Next How I Learned to Start Loving Social Media's Darkside Facebook's Panda Update So far this year publishers have lost 52% their Facebook distribution due to: increased ad load (another record quarter for Facebook!!!) shifting of the news feed "relevancy" algorithm toward friends promotion of new formats, like live video (if they subsidize it with direct payments, they're also algorithmically subsidizing its distribution) Instant Articles may have worked for an instant, but many publishers are likely where they were before they made the Faustian bargain, except they now have less control over their content distribution and advertising while having the higher cost structure of supporting another content format. When Facebook announced their news feed update to fight off clickbait headlines, it sure sounded a lot like the equivalent of Google's Panda update. Glenn Gabe is one of the sharpest guys in the SEO field who regularly publishes insightful content & doesn't blindly shill for the various platform monopolies dominating the online publishing industry & he had the same view I did. Wow, just realized this is a Panda-like Facebook algo update. "posts shared from domains & Pages will appear lower" https://t.co/IurVgPeL8D— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) August 4, 2016 Further cementing the "this is Panda" view was an AdAge article quoting some Facebook-reliant publishers. Glad we have already shifted our ways. Nice to see them moving in the same direction we are. etc. ... It felt like reading a Richard Rosenblatt quote in 2011 about Demand Media's strong working relationship with Google or how right after Panda their aggregate traffic level was flat. January 27, 2011 Peter Kafka: Do you think that Google post was directed at you in any way? Richard Rosenblatt: It’s not directed at us in any way. P K: they wrote this post, which talks about content farms, and even though you say they weren’t talking about you, it left a lot of people scratching their heads. R R: Let’s just say that we know what they’re trying to do. ... He’s talking about duplicate, non-original content. Every single piece of ours is original. ... our relationship is synergistic, and it’s a great partnership. May 9, 2011 Kara Swisher: What were you trying to communicate in the call, especially since investors seemed very focused on Panda? R R: What I also wanted to show was that third-party data sources should not be relied on. We did get affected, for sure. But I was not just being optimistic, we wanted to use that to really understand what we can do better. K S: Given Google’s shift in its algorithm, are you shifting your distribution, such as toward social and mobile? R R: If you look at where trends are going, that’s where we are going to be. K S: How are you changing the continued perception that Demand is a content farm? R R: I don’t think anyone has defined what a content farm is and I am not sure what it means either. We obviously don’t think we are a content farm and I am not sure we can counter every impact if some people think we are. A couple years later Richard Rosenblatt left the company. Since the Google Panda update eHow has removed millions of articles from their site. As a company they remain unprofitable a half-decade later & keep seeing YoY media ad revenue declines in the 30% to 40% range. Over-reliance on any platform allows that platform to kill you. And, in most cases, you are unlikely to be able to restore your former status until & unless you build influence via other traffic channels: I think in general, media companies have lost sight of building relationships with their end users that will bring them in directly, as opposed to just posting links on social networks and hoping people will click. I think publishers that do that are shooting themselves in the foot. Media companies in general are way too focused on being where our readers are, as opposed to being so necessary to our readers that they will seek us out. - Jessica Lessin, founder of TheInformation Recovering former status requires extra investment far above and beyond what led to the penalty. And if the core business model still has the same core problems there is no solution. "I feel pretty confident about the algorithm on Suite 101." - Matt Cutts Some big news publishers are trying to leverage video equivalents of a Narrative Science or Automated Insights (from Wochit and Wibbitz) to embed thousands of autogenerated autoplay videos in their articles daily. But is that a real long-term solution to turn the corner? Even if they see a short term pop in ad revenues by using some dumbed-down AI-enhanced low cost content, all that really does is teach people that they are a source of noise while increasing the number of web users who install ad blockers. And the whole time penalized publishers try to recover the old position of glory, the platform monopolies are boosting their AI skills in the background while they eat the playing field. The companies which run the primary ad networks can easily get around the ad blockers, but third party publishers can't. As the monopoly platforms broadly defund ad-based publishing, they can put users "in control" while speaking about taking the principle-based approach: “This isn’t motivated by inventory; it’s not an opportunity for Facebook from that perspective,” Mr. Bosworth said. “We’re doing it more for the principle of the thing. We want to help lead the discussion on this.” ... Mr. Bosworth said Facebook hasn't paid any ad-blocking software company to have its ads pass through their filters and that it doesn’t intend to. Google recently worked out a deal with Wikimedia to actually cite the source of the content shown in the search results: it hasn’t always been the easiest to see that the material came from Wikipedia while on mobile devices. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we’ve been working to change that. While the various platforms ride the edge on what is considered reasonable disclosure, regulatory bodies crack down on individuals participating on those platforms unless they are far more transparent than the platforms are: Users need to be clear when they're getting paid to promote something, and hashtags like #ad, #sp, #sponsored --common forms of identification-- are not always enough. The whole "eating the playing field" is a trend which is vastly under-reported, largely because almost everyone engaged in the ecosystem needs to sell they have some growth strategy. The reality is as the platform gets eaten it only gets harder to build a sustainable business. The mobile search interface is literally nothing but ads in most key categories. More ads. Larger ads. Nothing but ads. And a bit of scrape after the ads to ensure the second or third screen still shows zero organic results. @glenngabe those SERPs look even sexier when there are 3 or 4 AdWords above the knowledge graph. pic.twitter.com/tjdCuPBrCQ— aaron wall (@aaronwall) June 22, 2016 And more scraping, across more categories. Google monopolist not satisfied with above the fold they've now claimed "page 2" cc @kaufer #byeorganic pic.twitter.com/qGXmt2Z5K5— Jeremy Stoppelman (@jeremys) August 5, 2016 What's more, even large scaled companies in big money fields are struggling to monetize mobile users. On the most recent quarterly conference call TripAdvisor executives stated they monetize mobile users at about 30% the rate they monetize desktop or tablet users. What happens when the big brand advertisers stop believing in the narrative of the value of precise user tracking? We may soon find out: P&G two years ago tried targeting ads for its Febreze air freshener at pet owners and households with large families. The brand found that sales stagnated during the effort, but rose when the campaign on Facebook and elsewhere was expanded last March to include anyone over 18. ... P&G’s push to find broader reach with its advertising is also evident in the company’s recent increases in television spending. Toward the end of last year P&G began moving more money back into television, according to people familiar with the matter. For mobile to work well you need to be a destination & a habit. But there is tiny screen space and navigational searches are also re-routed through Google hosted content (which will, of course, get monetized). In fact, what would happen to an advertiser if they partnered with other advertisers to prevent brand bidding? Why that advertiser would get sued by the FTC for limiting user choice: The bidding agreements harm consumers, according to the complaint, by restraining competition for, and distorting the prices of, advertising in relevant online auctions, by reducing the number of relevant, useful, truthful and non-misleading advertisements, by restraining competition among online sellers of contact lenses, and in some cases, by resulting in consumers paying higher retail prices for contact lenses. If the above restraint of competition & market distortion is worth suing over, how exactly can Google make the mobile interface AMP exclusive without earning a similar lawsuit? AMP content presented in the both sections will be “de-duplicated” in order to avoid redundancies, Google says. The move is significant in that AMP results will now take up an entire phone screen, based on the example Google shows in its pitch deck. Are many publishers in a rush to support Google AMP after the bait-n-switch on Facebook Instant Articles?

Google says it's been able to drop the price of such VMs because its cloud has grown and it's become more efficient at identifying resources it can toss into the preemptive pool.

Subhrojit Mallick Aug 10, 2016, 12.15 PM IST FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinReddit Google Image Credit During I/O 2012, when Google first unveiled its voice-based digital assistant Google Now, the company promised it will bring people search results before they even searched for them. Google has been inching closer to realizing this dream with every new update to the Google Now app. According to a tipster, a new update is coming to the Now app which will allow users to set specific interests to get updates about, directly from Google as Now cards. The tipster has sent Android Police four screenshots that show an 'Explore Interests' page which allegedly will be a new way to keep track of various interests. Interests are varied and numerous. You can ask Google to update you on specific people including sports personalities, celebrities, politicians, etc. Know when the latest season of your favorite TV show is airing and read the reviews of the latest movies. You can also keep track of stocks. All and every update to the selected category will come up as a Now card on Google Now. What's so great about this new feature is that after setting it up, you can stay updated about almost anything directly within the Google app, without even searching for it. The Google Now update seems to be a precursor to Google's much ambitious Google Assistant, its answer to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. The Google assistant allows users to have natural language conversation with the app, much like the other digital assistants. Not much is known about the new feature as of yet, but it will first show up in two new products: Google Home and Allo. Before this, Google had updated its Google Now On Tap feature, which is the flagship feature of Android Marshmallow, with the option of instant translation. Highlight the text and summon Google Now with a tap and you will see a translate option in the menu that pops up.

The most recent nail being driven in comes courtesy of Google. Fast on the heels of Apple’s Safari browser, Google has announced that Chrome will prioritise HTML5 content over Flash wherever possible. Adobe Flash popped up at an awkward time for the internet. Developers wanted to do a lot more with the web than HTML standards allowed. Features like streaming multimedia content, rich interactions and animations, all these were close to impossible to implement. With Flash, Adobe offered a powerful tool that could do all this and more. But even then, it was an imperfect solution and for that, Adobe is entirely to blame. The original YouTube app on iOS had to convert flash videos for playback on the iPhone This was in the early 2000s, long before the iPhone and at a time when H.264 (you’ll know it as mp4 video today) wasn’t a mainstream codec. Early HTML was mostly about text and images, rich pages and embedded content wasn’t as easy to implement as with Adobe Flash. There was no real HTML standard when it came to streaming and animation and interaction was much easier to implement via Flash. We call the solution imperfect because Flash, while easy to implement, was a little hard to fine-tune. In fact, we rarely notice the good implementations of Flash, partly because there are so few of them and the bad ones, they completely ruin our browsing experience. Steve Jobs with the iPhone in 2007. Reuters To make matters worse, Flash was, and still is, a completely closed platform. As Steve Jobs himself put it in his famous “Thoughts on Flash” editorial, if something is positioning itself as a standard, it needs to be open. Apple’s iOS is a closed system, for example, but the standards it’s built on are all open-source. This makes for a more secure, reliable platform that is constantly updated. On a side-note, Apple developed WebKit using open-source standards and it proved to be so good, that Google used it right until their transition to Blink in 2013. Coming back to the topic at hand however, Adobe Flash’s closed and proprietary nature forced any developer that used Flash to be entirely dependent on Adobe for updates, features, libraries and more. Something that Adobe has never managed to stay on point with, especially when it comes to security. This is not ideal for either a developer or a user. If nothing else, Flash has developed quite a reputation for developing security holes. As Wired put it, the security holes almost seem like features now. In the early 2000s, streaming video and audio services had no option but to use Flash. If you remember the birth of YouTube in 2005, all video on the site was Flash video until very recently. Today more than 8 percent of the internet still relies on Flash, Web-based games, streaming video (even on modern sites like FIA’s WRC home page) and ads are still reliant on Flash. Almost all of this is down to the ease with which one can create flash content, and the reluctance of a certain group of people to upgrade. Why else would Internet Explorer (IE) still command about 10 percent market share (IE 6,7,8 and 9). Flash is dying, even Adobe knows that, but as Pixlr’s CEO points out, people outside the “tech bubble” don’t really care what they’re using as long as it works. This makes Flash more of a necessary evil than anything else, but it’s still more evil than it’s necessary. Like Safari, Opera, Edge and Firefox before it, Google is also not really killing off Flash just yet. All they’re doing is prioritising HTML5 content over Flash content. If you come across a site with Flash content, Google won’t stop you from viewing it. As one developer points out, HTML5 is still not good enough or reliable enough to completely replace Flash, but it’s getting there. Of course, making Flash open-source would go a long way towards improving its chances. I doubt Adobe would ever do that, however. Flash needs to die, but before that happens, HTML needs to stabilise fully. Hopefully, that will happen soon.
