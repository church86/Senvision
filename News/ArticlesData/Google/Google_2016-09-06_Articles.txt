Quality and relevance are different things, yet we often discuss them as if they were the same. SEOs have been optimizing for relevance all this time, but are now being asked to optimize for quality. This post will discuss what that means and how to do it, with a focus on what I believe to be the single most effective and scaleable tactic for improving your site's overall level of quality in most situations. You need BOTH quality AND relevance to compete these days. First, let's establish what we're talking about here, which is quality. You can have relevancy (the right topic and keywords) without quality, as shown here: This MFA site is highly relevant for the phrase "Chairs for Baby." But it also sucks. "...babies are sensitive, delicate individuals who need cautious. So choosing a right Chairs For Baby is your gentle care." WTF? It doesn’t matter how relevant the page is. The only way to get that page to rank these days would be to buy a lot of links, but then you're dealing with the added risk. After a certain point, it’s just EASIER to build a better site. Yes, Google has won that battle in all but the most hyper-competitive niches, where seasoned experts still find the reward:risk ratio in their favor. OK, now that we've established that quality and relevance are different things, but that you need both to rank, how do you optimize for quality? Quality Indicators Tactics (How to Optimize for Quality) Grammar, spelling, depth Hire a copy editor. Learn to write better. Expertise, Authority, Trust (EAT) Make content deep and useful. Call out your awards, certifications, news coverage, and use trust symbols. Make it easy to contact you, and easy to find policies like terms of service, returns, and privacy. PageRank (PR) from links Build high-quality links. There are thousands of great articles out there about it. Reviews Ask your best clients/customers. Short-clicks Improve Out-of-Stock pages with in-stock alerts and related products. Be less aggressive with your pop-up strategy. Also see query refinements, pages per visit, and dwell time. Query refinements Only attract the "right" audience and deliver what you promised in the search results. Choose keywords by relevance, not just volume. Think about query intent. Dwell time on site Make your pages stickier by improving the overall design. Add images and video. Run GA reports on the stickiest traffic sources and develop a strategy to increase traffic from those sources. Pages per visit Improve internal linking, suggest related content, customize 404 pages. Split up long posts into a series. Conversion rates Do A/B testing, make your messaging very clear, follow CRO best practices. Ad placements No ads above the main content on the page and do not have an annoying amount of ad blocks or pop-ups. CTR from SERPs Craft better title tags, URLs, and descriptions. Grab attention. Gain trust. Make them want to click. Add schema markup when appropriate. Page speed Visit https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/. Mobile experience Responsive and/or adaptive design, less text, easy navigation, loads lighting fast, shorter forms. There are many ways to improve the quality of your site. Some are obvious. Others are more abstract. All of these quality indicators together make up your site's overall level of quality. For more, check out the keyword agnostic ranking factors and the engagement metrics from SimilarWeb areas in the Moz Search Engine Ranking Factors report. We've already established that Google knows the relative quality of a page. Let's assume — because it is very likely — that Google also knows the relative quality of your entire site. And let's call that your sitewide QualityRank (QR) (h/t Ian Lurie, 2011). What's the most effective, scalable, proven tactic for improving a website's QR? In a word: Pruning. Learn more about it here. Pruning requires doing a content audit first, which you can learn more about here. It's nothing groundbreaking or new, but few clients come in the door that can't substantially benefit from this process. Sometimes pruning is as easy as applying a noindex tag to all pages that have had zero organic search traffic over the course of a year. You may be surprised how many enterprise-level sites have huge chunks of the site that fit that criteria. Other times it requires more analysis and tougher decisions. It really all depends on the site. So let's look at some pruning case studies. Three things to remember: 1. Significant portions of the sites were removed from Google's index. 2. Pruning was not the only thing that was done. Rarely do these things happen in a vacuum, but evidence points to pruning as a major contributor to the growth examples you're about to see. 3. You can read more about Inflow's research in our case studies section. 1800doorbell had technical issues that made it possible to identify cruft and prune big chunks of the site quickly. This contributed to a 96% increase in revenue from organic search within six months. The dip at the end has to do with how the timeline was generated in GA. Growth was sustained. We're not the only ones finding success with this. Go check out the Ahrefs case study for another example. Here's a compelling image from their case study: Ahrefs saw amazing results after performing a content audit and pruning their blog. If you weren't already convinced, I hope by now it's clear that performing a content audit to determine which pages should be improved and which should be pruned from Google's index is an effective and scalable SEO tactic. That being established, let's talk about why this might be. We don't know exactly how Google's ranking algorithms work. But it seems likely that there is a score for a site's overall level of quality. Does QualityRank actually exist as a calculation in Google's organic algorithm? Probably not under that name and not in this simplistic form. But it DOES seem likely that something similar would exist, especially since it exists for PPC. The problem I have with the PPC equivalent is that it includes relevance factors like keyword use in their metric for "quality." Google needs a way to measure the overall quality level of each site in order to rank them properly. It's just probably much more mathematically complicated than what we're talking about here. The point of discussing QualityRank as a framework for pruning is to help explain why pruning works. And to do that, we don't need to understand the complex formulas behind Google’s ranking algorithms. I doubt half of the engineers there know what's going on these days, anyway. Let’s imagine a site divided into thirds, with each third being assigned a QualityRank (QR) score based on the average QR of the pages within that section. The triangle below represents all indexable content on a domain with a QR of 30. That sitewide QR score of 30 comes from adding all three of these sections together and dividing by three. In the real world, this would not be so simple. I hope the mathematicians out there will grant me some leeway for the sake of illustrating the concept. This is the same site after removing the bottom 50 percent from the index: Notice the instant lift from QR 30 to QR 40 just by removing all LOW QR pages. That is why I say pruning is the most effective way to raise your site’s overall quality level for better rankings, IF you have a lot of low-quality pages indexed, which most sites do. Time to switch analogies Pruning works because it frees up the rest of your content from being weighed down by the cruft. "Cruft" includes everything from a 6-year-old blog post about the company holiday party to 20 different variants with their own landing pages for every product. It also includes pages that are inadvertently indexed for technical reasons, like faceted navigation URLs. Remove the bottom half of this iceberg and the rest of it will "rise up," making more of it visible above the surface (i.e. on the first 2–3 pages of Google). The idea of one page being weighed down by another has been around at least since the first Panda release. I'm not writing about anything new here, as evidenced by the many resources below. But I’m constantly surprised by the amount of dead weight most websites continue to carry around, and hope that this post motivates folks to finally get rid of some of it. Your choices are many: 404, 301, rel ="canonical", noindex, disallow... Some of the resources below will help you decide which solutions to use for your unique situation.

You explained Quality Rank (QR) in details here but not so much the "Relevance Rank" (RR). At what point does a low-quality website can outrank a high-quality one due to it's relevancy. For example, will a website with 100% QR / 40% RR rank higher than 60% QR / 80% RR? Another important thing is understanding the value of quality indicators. Obviously backlinks are the top factor for SE, but what would you recommend focusing on?

On some of our bigger sites, 85% of the pages are crawled less than once a month. Pruning the lower quality pages would certainly increase the crawl frequency on more interesting parts of our site. Working in publishing however it's not easy to convince my colleagues to prune articles. Apart from the content audit you mentioned, checking the log files can also reveal valuable information on "useless" or duplicate pages. On one site we discovered that old urls from previous versions of the site were still returning 200 status. These url's couldn't be found by crawling the site, but Googlebot remembered them & kept on crawling them. Part of them where "empty" pages, the others where duplicates of existing pages. We eliminated these pages (too soon however to see if there is an impact on traffic) 3 0 Reply <p>Nice post as usual Everett. </p>

Better crawlability is definitely one of the main reasons to prune your site. I'm not sure improving the existing content is the reason though. This is because we've seen this work at scale with just the pruning part, not the improving part. In other words, we removed low quality pages without improving others in some cases and noticed similar effects.

I'm curious about how much of a factor that is. I'm more concerned with the why than anything else. I suppose that it could be that some sort of engagement factor is actually being considered by Google (I don't want to open a can of worms on that debate) and that poor engaging content is negatively impacting the overall site performance. It could also be that NLP is a larger part of the algorithm than I would have expected and by removing extraneous pages, there's improvements to semantic closeness. Interesting in any case. 4 0 Reply <p>I can be wrong. That's okay :)</p>

<p>Have you tried to measure indexing changes? I'm curious about how much of a factor that is. I'm more concerned with the <em>why</em> than anything else. </p>

<p>Interesting in any case.</p> Submit Cancel Everett Sizemore 2016-09-07T08:39:33-07:00 Do you mean measuring the amount of indexed pages? Yes, and - on sites that need to be pruned - we'll typically see rankings and traffic improve as the amount of indexed pages in GSC goes down. I'm not sure we could isolate all of the variables to reach the level of certainty we'd all like in this industry. We just do what we find works and try to retroactively figure out what's going on in many cases, which is what I've done here. The can of worms I want to open is the one that follows advice from Googlers telling SEOs that Rel= "Canonical" on massive sites is the way to solve the cruft problem, and that a Noindex tag is superfluous. They've actually warned AGAINST pruning, which boggles my mind considering how much money they probably spend crawling, indexing and ranking all the cruft on the open web. Rel "Canonical" to another page doesn't remove a URL from the index, though the page to which it canonicalizes will be the one to show up. You can test this by searching with highly specific queries that surface non-canonical pages, such as these: https://t.co/iHpheuzYoW . Still indexed. Noindex,Follow still allows the pages to be crawled, but log file analysis will probably show you that these pages are now being crawled much less frequently. More importantly, as explained above, they are no longer "indexed" by Google, which seems to have an effect in-and-of itself. Telling Google "This URL is equivalent to this other URL" is not the same as saying "This URL should not be in your index". I also want to make sure it is clear that I'm not talking about pruning "instead of" improving. Improving the page is the better option in most cases. This is a matter of scale and prioritization. As for the effect being due to closer semantics, that is one of the reasons I pointed out the difference between quality and relevancy. You may need to prune highly "relevant" pages in terms of the semantic closeness to your main topics, but I suspect you'll still see the lift by removing relevant, but low-quality, URLs from the index.

For example, it would rank a property portal above a real estate company when someone is searching for "real estate company." Just because the portal is a behemoth containing many real estate companies, this does not make it more relevant, since it is not actually a "real estate company." Google needs to figure this out and apply fairness and relevance to it's results. There are many many examples like this across ALL sectors. 1 0 Reply <p>We think that Google has a real challenge on it's hands to determine the most relevant results.

Given that many people search for shoes by color, that could potentially be one to leave indexed and optimized. Maybe facets and category pages are the same thing on some platforms. Then it just becomes a matter of scale. Having 100 canonical category landing pages indexed may be necessary for your business, but if you have 10,000 of them indexed it may be time to adjust your strategy. 1 0 Reply <p>DCRader, I would make those static category pages instead of facets if they get a lot of search volume.

The platform can be accessed from multiple devices, including mobile and PCs. While many people do not see YouTube as a social network, Google is working on a plan to bring out the social attributes of this video sharing platform. In short, the search engine giant wants to make YouTube more of the same with the likes of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn, among others. According to the latest rumors, Google is working on a new YouTube feature that will let users more than just comment on the videos shared on the platform. Dubbed Backstage, the feature will make the video sharing platform become better at social networking than what is currently offers. With Backstage, YouTube users will reportedly be able to share a lot more than the videos they’ve watched. These include photos, links, polls, text posts as well as exclusive videos. In this way, the platform will be adding new ways of interaction, something it hopes will eventually let the millions who are subscribed to the service reply to posts in different ways – be it using videos, photos, texts or other type of comments. Apparently, this feature has an internal name within the company and its rich replies. For a start, Google will only roll out this rich replies feature to select YouTube accounts, probably those with massive followers. The feature will reportedly get its own tab beside the Home button. Possible release set for this year While the news of a Backstage feature on YouTube is still a rumor, the same reports add that the platform might go social before the end of this year. Google has struggled in this niche, with Google+ failing miserably, the efforts to take a different approach with this video sharing app could just be another attempt by the company to compete with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. With this in mind, it should be interesting to see how this Backstage YouTube feature fits in.

Google Dumbs Down Safe Browsing Alerts to Help Out Lesser-Skilled Webmasters GO Google simplifies warning for hacked websites Sep 7, 2016 23:10 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google has announced new changes to the Google Search Console, more specifically, to the Safe Browsing alerts that inform users about security-related problems found on their sites. Google's Safe Browsing technology allows users to report suspicious sites, which are then blocked in browsers that implement the Safe Browsing API, such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. For us, the regular users, Safe Browsing is the red alert pages we see every day when navigating to a website hosting malicious content. But there's another side to Safe Browsing warnings that most of us don't know about, and that's the alerts the owners of these sites receive when their website is marked as malicious. While crooks hosting malicious websites don't care about these warnings, there are many hacked websites belonging to legitimate businesses that want their website removed from the Safe Browsing blacklist and returned to regular Google search results. New alert explanations available via Google Search Console dashboard If the webmaster has an account in the Google Search Console, a dashboard for managing the interactions between Google's search services and webmasters, the site admin can see why Google banned their website. In an update announced a few days ago, the Google Security team is revealing new and improved explanation messages for the Google Search Console, related to Safe Browsing warnings. Webmasters visiting this dashboard will now be able to know exactly why their site has been banned and where to look for the malicious content. Warnings will cut down the time needed to clean websites, file an appeal More in-depth explanations will help the webmaster cut down the time required to clean out their website, without the need to hire a web security professional to scan their site and get to the bottom of the problem. Additionally, this also reduces the time needed to file an appeal (site review) with Google and have the site reinstated. "The updated information provides more specific explanations of six different security issues detected by Safe Browsing, including malware, deceptive pages, harmful downloads, and uncommon downloads," explains Kelly Hope Harrington, from Google's Safe Browsing Team. Since these warnings are shown in the Google Search Console, webmasters are encouraged to register their sites with Google's dashboard, which will also notify them via email of any problems when they pop up.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS Google will block Flash in Chrome 53 By Mark Wilson Published 3 months ago 10 Comments Tweet Following the lead of Apple with Safari in macOS Sierra, and Mozilla with Firefox, Google has announced that Chrome will begin to block Flash content. Starting with Chrome 53 in September, Google will "de-emphasize Flash in favor of HTML5". Google says that the decision has been made to improve security, performance, and battery life, and it builds on an earlier change that made some Flash content click-to-play rather than loading it by default. Flash is very much a lumbering technology of the past, and Google points out that "more than 90 percent of Flash on the web loads behind the scenes to support things like page analytics". But what's happening with version 53 of Chrome is just the start. Towards the end of the year, things will start to get even more serious as the death knell sounds louder than ever for Flash: In December, Chrome 55 will make HTML5 the default experience, except for sites which only support Flash. For those, you’ll be prompted to enable Flash when you first visit the site. Aside from that, the only change you’ll notice is a safer and more power-efficient browsing experience. It has been a long, slow journey, but it's starting to feel as those the days of Flash truly are numbered, paving the way for HTML5 to takeover properly.

Facebook announced earlier this year that they were shutting down Parse on January 28th, 2017 and new signups to the service aren’t possible. With that surprise announcement, this forced developers relying on the service to start looking for alternatives that they could migrate their data to. Because of this news, I thought I should revisit the topic and cover how to use a different Backend as a Service platform to manage data for your Android application. For this tutorial, I’ll be looking at Firebase, a popular backend platform acquired by Google in October 2014. You should always weigh the pros and cons of relying on a BaaS as opposed to building your own. Parse is not the first BaaS platform to shut down (e.g., StackMob) and won’t be the last. As a developer relying on one of these platforms, you should always be ready to migrate and have a backup plan. With Firebase, you can store and sync data to a NoSQL cloud database. The data is stored as JSON, synced to all connected clients in realtime, and available when your app goes offline. It offers APIs that enable you to authenticate users with email and password, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Google, anonymous auth, or to integrate with existing authentication system. Other than the Realtime Database and Authentication, it offers a myriad of other services including Cloud Messaging, Storage, Hosting, Remote Config, Test Lab, Crash Reporting, Notification, App Indexing, Dynamic Links, Invites, AdWords, AdMob. In this article, you’ll create a simple To Do app that will show how to save and retrieve data from Firebase, how to authenticate users, set read/write permissions on the data and validate the data on the server. More from this author Creating a Backend for Your iOS App Using Firebase Adding Maps to an Android App with Google Play Services You can find the code for this project on GitHub. Setting up the Project To get started, create a new project named To Do. Set Minimum SDK as API 15 in the next window and select Basic Activity in the next. Click Finish on the last window, leaving the settings at their default. Before starting the Android project, head over to firebase.google.com and create an account. After logging in to your account, head over to the Firebase console and create a project that will hold your app’s data. Enter a name and country/region for the project. The country/region represents the country/region of your organization/company. Your selection also sets the appropriate currency for your revenue reporting. After setting a name (I used SPToDoApp) and region for the project, click on the Create Project button. This will create a project and its console will open. From the project’s console, click on the Add Firebase to your Android App option. Enter your Android project’s package name in the window that pops up. If your app is going to use certain Google Play services such as Google Sign-In, App Invites, Dynamic Links, e.t.c. then you will have to provide the SHA-1 of your signing certificate. This app won’t be using any of these services, so leave this field empty. If you wish to add these services to your app, head over to this page for information on using keytool to get the SHA-1 hash of your signing certificate. The page contains instructions for obtaining both release and debug certificate fingerprints. When done, click on the Add App button. Clicking on Add App will download a google-services.json file to your computer. The next page of the dialog box gives instructions of where to place the downloaded JSON file. Locate the downloaded file and move it into your Android project’s app module root directory. The JSON file contains configuration settings that the Android app needs to communicate with the Firebase servers. It contains details such as the URL to the Firebase project, the API key, etc. In the previous version of Firebase, you had to store these manually in your app’s code, but now the process has been simplified with the use of one file that contains the needed data. If you are using version control and storing your code in a public repository, you should consider placing the google-services.json file in the .gitignore file, so that this information isn’t available to the public. When finished, click Continue on the dialog window and you will be given further setup instructions. To your Project-level build.gradle file, add the following to the buildscript > dependencies node. This is done to include the Google services plugin for Gradle which loads the google-services.json file that you downloaded. classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'
 Make sure you are editing the right gradle file. Then in your App-level build.gradle file, add the following at the bottom of the file to enable the Gradle plugin. apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
 Again, make sure it’s the right build.gradle file. Then add the following dependencies to the same file. Firebase has different SDKs for its features. Here you add the library needed to use the Realtime Database and the one needed for Authentication. compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-database:9.4.0'
compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:9.4.0'
 Create an empty activity by selecting the File -> New -> Activity -> Empty Activity menu item and name it LogInActivity. Create another and name it SignUpActivity. Change the contents of the activity_log_in.xml layout file to: < ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

 activity_main.xml has an include tag that points to and loads content_main.xml. The app will display the To Do items in a list view that will occupy most of the screen. At the bottom of the screen, will be an edit text field and a button to add items to the list. With the app’s UI set up, you’ll now look at how to save and retrieve data to and from Firebase. Security and Rules Before retrieving and saving data from the Firebase server, you need to set up authentication and add rules that restrict access to data and validate user input before it’s saved. Authentication The Firebase API has built-in methods for email/password, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Google and anonymous authentication. This tutorial will use email and password authentication. Head over to the Firebase console and open your project’s Dashboard by clicking on the project. If you select Database from the left panel, you will be able to see project’s data that is in JSON format. Firebase stores all database data as JSON objects. There are no tables or records. When you add data to the JSON tree, it becomes a key in the existing JSON structure. At the moment you can only see the root node. If you hover over a node, you will see + and x controls that you can use to add data to the tree and delete that node respectively. From the left panel, click on Auth and then select the Sign In Method tab on the right. Enable Email/Password authentication from the given providers. In Android Studio, add the following method to MainActivity. private void loadLogInView() {
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, LogInActivity.class);
    intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
    intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK);
    startActivity(intent);
}
 This navigates to the Login view and clears the activity stack. This prevents the user going back to the main activity when they press the Back button from the login view. Add the following variables to the class. private FirebaseAuth mFirebaseAuth;
private FirebaseUser mFirebaseUser;
 Then add the following to the bottom of onCreate(). // Initialize Firebase Auth
mFirebaseAuth = FirebaseAuth.getInstance();
mFirebaseUser = mFirebaseAuth.getCurrentUser();

if (mFirebaseUser == null) {
    // Not logged in, launch the Log In activity
    loadLogInView();
}
 Here you check for the logged in user. If the user isn’t logged in, getCurrentUser() will return null, otherwise it will return a FirebaseUser object which will contain details of the logged in user. If the user isn’t logged in, loadLogInView() is called which redirects the user to the Login view. Run the app and you should be redirected to the Login page. Add the following to LogInActivity. protected EditText emailEditText;
protected EditText passwordEditText;
protected Button logInButton;
protected TextView signUpTextView;
private FirebaseAuth mFirebaseAuth;
 Change the onCreate() method of the LogInActivity class to: @Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_log_in);

    // Initialize FirebaseAuth
    mFirebaseAuth = FirebaseAuth.getInstance();

    signUpTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.signUpText);
    emailEditText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.emailField);
    passwordEditText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.passwordField);
    logInButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.loginButton);

    signUpTextView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            Intent intent = new Intent(LogInActivity.this, SignUpActivity.class);
            startActivity(intent);
        }
    });

    logInButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
            String email = emailEditText.getText().toString();
            String password = passwordEditText.getText().toString();

            email = email.trim();
            password = password.trim();

            if (email.isEmpty() || password.isEmpty()) {
                AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(LogInActivity.this);
                builder.setMessage(R.string.login_error_message)
                        .setTitle(R.string.login_error_title)
                        .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.ok, null);
                AlertDialog dialog = builder.create();
                dialog.show();
            } else {
                mFirebaseAuth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
                        .addOnCompleteListener(LogInActivity.this, new OnCompleteListener<authresult>() {
                            @Override
                            public void onComplete(@NonNull Task</authresult><authresult> task) {
                                if (task.isSuccessful()) {
                                    Intent intent = new Intent(LogInActivity.this, MainActivity.class);
                                    intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
                                    intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK);
                                    startActivity(intent);
                                } else {
                                    AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(LogInActivity.this);
                                    builder.setMessage(task.getException().getMessage())
                                            .setTitle(R.string.login_error_title)
                                            .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.ok, null);
                                    AlertDialog dialog = builder.create();
                                    dialog.show();
                                }
                            }
                        });
            }
        }
    });
}
 This initiates the view elements and the FirebaseAuth object, which is the entry point of the Firebase Authentication SDK. An event listener is added to the Sign Up text view that will open the Sign Up activity when tapped. Another event listener on the Login button performs validation on the user input, ensuring the user entered text for both fields. It then calls the Firebase server with signInWithEmailAndPassword(). The function takes the user email and password and returns a Task of AuthResult.You check if the Task is successful and redirect the user to the MainActivity, otherwise show them an error message. Below is the error message gotten from trying to login a user that hasn’t registered. You might want to show the user a better message than the one returned by task.getException().getMessage() in your app. You can check for the Exception returned to determine the error message to show the user. You can get one of the following exceptions when authentication fails: FirebaseAuthInvalidUserException thrown if the user account corresponding to email does not exist or disabled. FirebaseAuthInvalidCredentialsException thrown if the password is wrong. Apart from signInWithEmailAndPassword(), you can use the following to log in the user: signInWithCredential(AuthCredential) – Tries to sign in a user with the given AuthCredential. Use this method to sign in a user into your Firebase Authentication system. First retrieve the credential either directly from the user, in case of EmailAuthCredential, or from a supported authentication SDK, such as Google Sign-In or Facebook. signInAnonymously() – Signs in the user anonymously without requiring any credential. This method creates a new account in your Firebase Authentication system, except in the case where there was already an anonymous user signed in into this app. signInWithCustomToken(String) – Tries to sign in a user with a given Custom Token. Use this method after you retrieve a Firebase Auth Custom Token from your server, to sign in a user into your Firebase Authentication system. With the Login functionality done, let’s set up Sign Up.

 The createUserWithEmailAndPassword() method tries to create a new user account with the given email address and password. If successful, it also signs the user into the app. A Task of AuthResult is returned with the result of the operation. You check to see if registration was successful and redirect the user to MainActivity, otherwise show them an error message. In your app, you can check for the exception thrown to decide on the error message you will show to your users. The following are the possible exceptions thrown in case of an error in creating an account. FirebaseAuthWeakPasswordException thrown if the password is not strong enough FirebaseAuthInvalidCredentialsException thrown if the email address is malformed FirebaseAuthUserCollisionException thrown if there already exists an account with the given email Run the app. If you tap on the Sign Up text view on the Log In view, the Sign Up view will open. Register an account. By default, firebase does some default validation on the data. For example, your password has to be at least 6 characters long. If you also try to sign up with an invalid email, you will get the following error. If registration is successful, you will be directed to the MainActivity. If you look at the Firebase Console, you should be able to see the created user under Auth > Users. The Firebase team built an open source library called FirebaseUI that simplifies the process of adding Authentication and connecting common UI elements to the Firebase database. Read the documentation to learn more about the library. Authorization and Data Validation Identifying your user is only one part of security. Once you know who they are, you need a way to control their access to data in your Firebase database. Firebase has a declarative language for specifying rules that live on the Firebase servers and determine the security of your app. You can edit them on the Database > Rules tab. The Security Rules allow you to control access to each part of your database. By default, Firebase has security rules that require users to be authenticated. {
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
 Firebase Database Rules have a JavaScript-like syntax and come in four types: .read – Describes if and when data is allowed d to be read by users. .write – Describes if and when data is allowed to be written. .validate – Defines what a correctly formatted value will look like, whether it has child attributes, and the data type. .indexOn – Specifies a child to index to support ordering and querying. .read and .write rules cascade, so the following ruleset grants read access to any data at path /foo/ (can also refer to it as the node foo) as well as any deeper paths such as /foo/bar/baz. Note that .read and .write rules shallower in the database override deeper rules, so read access to /foo/bar/baz would still be granted in this example even if a rule at the path /foo/bar/baz evaluated to false.  {
  "rules": {
    "foo": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": false
    }
  }
}
 .validate rules do not cascade. Modify the rules as shown and hit Publish. {
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid",
        "items": {
          "$item_id": {
            "title": {
              ".validate": "newData.isString() && newData.val().length > 0"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
 In the above rules, auth != null && auth.uid == $uid restricts read and write permission of data on the users node (as well as its child nodes) to the user whose uid matches the id of the logged in user (auth.uid). The $uid is a variable that holds the value at that node and not the name of the node itself. With this rule, not only will the user need to be authenticated to read or write any data to the node and its children, but they will also only have access to their own data. The Firebase Database Rules include built-in variables and functions that allow you to refer to other paths, server-side timestamps, authentication information, and more. You can use these variables and functions to build expressive rules. These variables and functions give rules power and flexibility, allowing you to refer to other paths, server-side timestamps, e.t.c. In the apps rules, you use the built-in variable auth. This variable is populated after your user authenticates. It contains data about the user including auth.uid, a unique, alphanumeric identifier that works across providers. The available variables are: now – The current time in milliseconds since Linux epoch. This works particularly well for validating timestamps created with the SDK’s firebase.database.ServerValue.TIMESTAMP. root – A RuleDataSnapshot representing the root path in the Firebase database as it exists before the attempted operation. newData – A RuleDataSnapshot representing the data as it would exist after the attempted operation. It includes the new data being written and existing data. data – A RuleDataSnapshot representing the data as it existed before the attempted operation. $variables – A wildcard path used to represent ids and dynamic child keys. auth – Represents an authenticated user’s token payload. Firebase stores data in JSON format. In our database, each user will have an array of to-do items named items. Each item will have a title. In the above, you add some data validation that ensures that data written to /users//items must be a string greater than 0 characters long. Therefore, an item with an empty title won’t be saved. Make sure you click on the Publish button, otherwise the rules won’t be saved. You should see a “Rules published” message. Validation rules are great but they shouldn’t replace data validation code in your app. You should still validate input in you app to improve performance. Saving and Retrieving Data Add the following variables to MainActivity: private DatabaseReference mDatabase;
private String mUserId;
 Then change onCreate() as shown. @Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    Toolbar toolbar = (Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.toolbar);
    setSupportActionBar(toolbar);

    // Initialize Firebase Auth and Database Reference
    mFirebaseAuth = FirebaseAuth.getInstance();
    mFirebaseUser = mFirebaseAuth.getCurrentUser();
    mDatabase = FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().getReference();

    if (mFirebaseUser == null) {
        // Not logged in, launch the Log In activity
        loadLogInView();
    } else {
        mUserId = mFirebaseUser.getUid();

        // Set up ListView
        final ListView listView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.listView);
        final ArrayAdapter<string> adapter = new ArrayAdapter<>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, android.R.id.text1);
        listView.setAdapter(adapter);

        // Add items via the Button and EditText at the bottom of the view.
        final EditText text = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.todoText);
        final Button button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.addButton);
        button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                mDatabase.child("users").child(mUserId).child("items").push().child("title").setValue(text.getText().toString());
                text.setText("");
            }
        });

        // Use Firebase to populate the list.
        mDatabase.child("users").child(mUserId).child("items").addChildEventListener(new ChildEventListener() {
            @Override
            public void onChildAdded(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot, String s) {
                adapter.add((String) dataSnapshot.child("title").getValue());
            }

            @Override
            public void onChildChanged(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot, String s) {

            }

            @Override
            public void onChildRemoved(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {
                adapter.remove((String) dataSnapshot.child("title").getValue());
            }

            @Override
            public void onChildMoved(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot, String s) {

            }

            @Override
            public void onCancelled(DatabaseError databaseError) {

            }
        });
    }
}
 You create a reference to the root node of the database with FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().getReference(). You then set a listener on the Add New Item button that saves data to Firebase when clicked. There are four methods for writing data to the Firebase Realtime Database: setValue() – Write or replace data to a defined path, such as users/<user -id>/<username>. push() – Add to a list of data. Every time you call push(), Firebase generates a unique key that can also be used as a unique identifier, such as user-posts/<user -id>/<unique -post-id>. updateChildren() – Update some of the keys for a defined path without replacing all of the data. runTransaction() – Update complex data that could be corrupted by concurrent updates. In our code, data is saved with: mDatabase.child("users").child(mUserId).child("items").push().child("title").setValue(text.getText().toString());
 .child gets a reference to the specified node if it exists or creates it if it doesn’t exist. The above will save the entered text at the path /users/<user id>/items/<item id>/title. .push() generates a new child location using a unique key. You use it to generate a unique key for each item added. .setValue() writes or replaces data to the defined path. To retrieve data from Firebase, add a listener to the database reference with addChildEventListener(). You can listen for the following types of events that retrieve data: ValueEventListener: onDataChange() Read and listen for changes to the entire contents of a path. ChildEventListener: onChildAdded() – Retrieve lists of items or listen for additions to a list of items. Suggested use with onChildChanged() and onChildRemoved() to monitor changes to lists. ChildEventListener: onChildChanged() – Listen for changes to the items in a list. Use with onChildAdded() and onChildRemoved() to monitor changes to lists. ChildEventListener: onChildRemoved() – Listen for items being removed from a list. Use with onChildAdded() and onChildChanged() to monitor changes to lists. ChildEventListener: onChildMoved() – Listen for changes to the order of items in an ordered list. onChildMoved() events always follow the onChildChanged() event that caused the item’s order to change (based on your current order-by method). Our simple app only allows items to be removed or added to the list, so use onChildRemoved() and onChildAdded() respectively. The listener receives a DataSnapshot, which is a snapshot of the data. A snapshot is a picture of the data at a particular location in a Firebase database at a single point in time. Calling getValue() on a snapshot returns the Java object representation of the data. The possible types returned by getValue() are Boolean, String, Long, Double, Map<string , Object>, and List<object>. If no data exists at the location, the snapshot will return null and it’s a good idea to check for null before you try using the data. Finally, add the retrieved data to the list view. If you run the app and add some items, they will be added to the list and to the database. You can add data from the Firebase console by clicking on the green + control on a node and entering the data. Just make sure you enter data in the correct format or the Android app will crash when it tries reading the data. In a production app, you should add validation to ensure it doesn’t crash when it gets the wrong data. To add an item from the Console, click the + on the items node and add the following to the name field. You have to enter the full path //title. /123/title
 Add “This was added using the console” to the value field and hit Save. The item will be added to the data and if you look at your Android app, the list will have updated itself with the item. The current app sends a String to the server. This works, but for a more complex app, your model objects will be more complex. Firebase allows you to pass your own custom Java object to DatabaseReference.setValue() read data into an object with DataSnapshot.getValue() , provided the class that defines it has a default constructor that takes no arguments and public getters for the properties to be assigned. For more on this check the documentation. To see this in action, create a class named Item and change it to: package com.echessa.todo;

        return title;
    }

    public void setTitle(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }
}
 Change the Add New Item button’s on click listener to: button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    public void onClick(View v) {
        Item item = new Item(text.getText().toString());
        mDatabase.child("users").child(mUserId).child("items").push().setValue(item);
        text.setText("");
    }
});
 This uses an Item object to save data to the database. The contents of the Item are mapped to child locations in a nested fashion. Run the app and you should still be able to add data to the list and see the saved data on the server console. Deleting Data Your app can now save data and retrieve it to populate a list view. Next it needs to allow users to delete items from a list and Firebase. Add the following to the bottom of the else block in onCreate() in the MainActivity class: // Delete items when clicked
listView.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {
    public void onItemClick(AdapterView< ?> parent, View view, int position, long id) {
        mDatabase.child("users").child(mUserId).child("items")
                .orderByChild("title")
                .equalTo((String) listView.getItemAtPosition(position))
                .addListenerForSingleValueEvent(new ValueEventListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {
                        if (dataSnapshot.hasChildren()) {
                            DataSnapshot firstChild = dataSnapshot.getChildren().iterator().next();
                            firstChild.getRef().removeValue();
                        }
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void onCancelled(DatabaseError databaseError) {

                    }
                });
    }
});
 This sets an onclick listener on the list view and queries the database when an item is tapped. It searches the Firebase database for the item with a title equal to the string at the tapped location. With a more complex app you might want to search for something that is unique to the object, like an id. It then removes the first occurrence of the item from the database. The listview is automatically updated. Run the app and you will be able to delete an item from Firebase by tapping on it in the Android app. Logging Users Out Calling signout() invalidates a user’s token, and logs them out of your app. Change the following lines in onOptionsItemSelected(). This logs out the user and redirects them to the Login view. if (id == R.id.action_logout) {
    mFirebaseAuth.signOut();
    loadLogInView();

 Data Droid In this tutorial you learned how to use Firebase to manage your Android app’s user data. This was an introductory tutorial and Firebase offers plenty of features not covered which you can explore further in the documentation. I’d love to hear your comments, ideas and experiences using Firebase in your apps. More: baas, database, FireBase, parse, storage Meet the author Joyce Echessa I am a web developer who dabbles in mobile development from time to time. You can find me on Twitter @joyceechessa to see what I’m up to. http://www.thecheesyanimation.com/Interior-Design-&-Rendering.html edie lowther Useful article and I think Firebase is one of them http://tech.3si.vn tranhieu please write cloud Backend for iOS , just for funny ^^ http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa I’ll see if I can get an article on iOS done. Thanks for reading. Juan Luis Sánchez Did they make the article for iOS? Hkr Youcef it’s very good thenx bro Victor Rodriguez Nice tutorial !, one silly question, how do you clear text field after insert an item? http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa You could add the following at the bottom of the Add New Item button on click listener’s onClick() method (right after the call to Firebase). text.setText(“”); Victor Rodriguez Again, super nice tutorial, I love Firebase – Android combination. I have been looking for housr, adn I can’t find how to -> Click Cloud and then select the checkbox to add Firebase to your app. This option does not appears in my Android Studio ! http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa Sorry for the late reply. You probably found the solution, but I’ll answer for anyone who might need it later. For the option, navigate to File > Project Structure from the Android Studio menu. A window will open that will have the option Cloud on its left panel. If you select Cloud, then the right panel will present the Firebase option. If you still can’t find it, you can do what this option does manually. All it adds is the dependency in the gradle file: compile ‘com.firebase:firebase-client-android:2.5.2+’ and also adds internet permission to the manifest file: So you can add them yourself. I hope that helps. JULIUS AMEH Thank you so much for this. I used it and all was working well but when i tried my app on a JellyBean device, i always get the error message “The specified email address is invalid”. Please help Ngô Cương why I fill info then click button “Sign up”. it send notification “the specitied authentication provider is not enabled for this firebase” Marian Vasile Caraiman I’m getting same error. Did you manage to solve it ? I tried from Firebase console to add the google-service.json and to add references to google-services package, without any luck. I updated my Android Studio to get latest updates from “Beta channel”, still nothing changes. http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa Have you enabled Email/Password Sign-in provider on Firebase? Marian Vasile Caraiman Yes, I did that. I also used the “use firebase in your Android app” that provides a json file to import in the project and make use of google-services, still without luck http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa Then I really don’t know what could be the problem. Checking the Firebase java docs, I see the below description for the error: public static final FirebaseSimpleLoginErrorCode AuthenticationProviderNotEnabled The specified auth provider is not enabled for your Firebase. Enable it in your App Dashboard. But if you say you have enabled it and are still getting the bug, then I don’t know what could be up. Maybe the issue is with Firebase. At the moment, they seem to have an issue with authentication for some users on Android. The following message is on the Android docs page at the moment of writing this: We are currently investigating an issue affecting Firebase Authentication on some Android devices. We recommend not launching an Android app using Firebase Authentication to production until this is resolved. But the issue seems fairly recent and it’s not the same error you are getting: We are investigating an issue with Firebase Authentication on Android. Affected developers will see the FirebaseApiNotAvailableException error on some devices running Google Play Services 9.0.83. So basically ¯_(ツ)_/¯ :-) Maybe wait it out (if it’s their bug, it might get fixed) or file an issue. Marian Vasile Caraiman thank you for looking into this. I guess it’s Firebase error and I will play with Google Play Services versions to see if I get over it. RV Hi, Did you manage to solve this problem? Marian Vasile Caraiman Not yet, I didn’t have time to dig more. Mourad Yahia Thank you for this awesome tutorial ! This saved my day =) thank you !! http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa Thanks. I’m glad it helped kneth sokot Hi thank you for a very helpful tutorial, I learnt a lot. I have only one question, can you tell us how to upload image please? Explaining how we can do that with this To Do app. http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa You wouldn’t upload images to Firebase directly. You can either have the images hosted on a server and save their url to Firebase with whatever object is connected to the image(s). Or you can convert the image to a base64 string and then save that to Firebase. If you can do the first solution, that might be preferable. You will only be storing a simple string (the url) on Firebase so you won’t run into bandwidth and storage limits as fast as with the other solution, but if you can’t host the images somewhere else, then go with the latter. Code to convert an image to base64 can be found here I hope that helps. kneth sokot Thank you very much Joyce for the reply. You are so very kind. May God continue to bless you with the knowledge. :)) http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa In light of yesterday’s Google i/o keynote, I should change my answer. Google has upgraded Firebase, so now it’s possible to store images and other files on Firebase. Here is an article of the changes made to Firebase. The feature you are looking for is called Firebase Storage. Documentation can be found here kneth sokot Thank you Joyce for those links. You are truly a blessing. Jah bless =) Jendrik Hi, thanks for your great tutorial! Maybe you can help me. I need a server, who does stuff with the received data (json-files and/or strings). But I can´t find any examples who show me how to do that. I´ve got no idea how to build an jsp and servlet for example. Could you give me a link? Thanks a lot Jendrik James Cosgrave Great tutorial you helped me understand a lot Mahesh Battula Hi I need a advice. I am want to build a social app, now that Parse is shutting down, is Firebase a good choice ? Or should I any other service ? I want something which is as easy as Parse so that I can concentrate on my app. I read that using Amazon services takes time to build backend. With firebase can get started quickly ? http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa Hi Mahesh, Sorry for the late reply. Firebase is ideal if your app doesn’t involve complex data processing. Firebase provides data storage, data validation and authentication. If your app requires complex data processing, then you should look into another service that allows you to write custom server-side code. Parse has this, it’s called Parse Code. You can write your own server-side code that does more than what the service offers. Here is a list of alternatives to Parse with brief summaries of what they offer. You might find it useful in making your decision. I can’t give you a definite answer without knowing the complete project spec. If it’s a simple social app, then Firebase can be sufficient. If it is complex, then it might have some requirements that will not be able to be accomplished by using Firebase alone. Junie Negentien hello, where can i Download the whole code? I got problems in testing your tutorial. Thanks Jinal Patel I am getting this error on sign up FirebaseError: Projects created at console.firebase.google.com must use the new Firebase Authentication SDKs available from firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa Hi, Since writing the tutorial, Firebase underwent a whole revamp. The APIs were upgraded and a lot of the changes aren’t backwards compatible. That’s why the tutorial as it stands, produces so many bugs. I’m updating it this week, so expect working instructions later on in the week or early next week. I’ll post here again once it has been updated. http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa The article is now up to date with the new Firebase version nitish kumar Did u get way to solve the problem. http://www.echessa.com/ Joyce Echessa Hi. Here is a link to that. I hope that helps.

Using research and targeted advertising, the initiative by London-based startup Moonshot CVE and Google’s Jigsaw technology incubator targets potentially violent jihadis and directs them to a YouTube channel with videos that refute ISIS propaganda. In the pilot program countering ISIS, the so-called Redirect Method collected the metadata of 320,000 individuals over the course of eight weeks, using 1,700 keywords, and served them advertisements that led them to the videos. Collectively, the targets watched more than half a million minutes of videos. The event at Brookings was primarily about the existing program aimed at undermining ISIS recruiting. “I think this is an extremely promising method,” said Richard Stengel, U.S. undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs. Ross Frenett, co-founder of Moonshot, said his company and Jigsaw are now working with funding from private groups, including the Gen Next Foundation, to target other violent extremists, including on the hard right. “We are very conscious — as our own organization and I know Jigsaw are — that this [violent extremism] is not solely the problem of one particular group,” Frenett said. “Our efforts during phase two, when we’re going to focus on the violent far right in America, will be very much focused on the small element of those that are violent. The interesting thing about how they behave is they’re a little bit more brazen online these days than ISIS fan boys,” Frenett said. He noted that this new target demographic is more visible online. “In the U.K., if someone in their Facebook profile picture has a swastika and is pointing a gun at the camera, that person is committing a crime,” Frenett said. “In the U.S., there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. So we found that when we’re looking for individuals that are genuinely at risk of carrying out violence, that they’re relatively open online.” Adnan Kifayat, head of global security ventures at Gen Next Foundation, said he is optimistic about applying the ISIS approach to North America. “Our interest is in countering extremism … particularly in the homeland,” he told The Intercept. Gen Next Foundation, based in Newport Beach, California, was founded by a group of young executives, authors, entrepreneurs, and others to fight terrorism. In the ISIS pilot program, the YouTube channel pulls pre-existing videos that, according to Yasmin Green, the head of research and development for Jigsaw, “refute ISIS’s messaging.” One video is from a woman who secretly filmed her life in ISIS-controlled Raqqa. Another shows young people in Mosul, their faces obscured by keffiyehs for their protection, talking about life under the Islamic State. “The branding philosophy for the entire pilot project was not to appear judgmental or be moralistic, but really to pique interest of individuals who have questions, questions that are being raised and answered by the Islamic State,” Green said. The next phase will also home in on changes in users’ behavior. “The idea that you can’t measure consumption patterns online is frankly absurd,” Frenett said.

My advice? Focus on content marketing. What is content marketing? In basic terms, it’s the creation and publishing of content related to your business and/or industry. Usually it’s writing (or videotaping) and maintaining a company blog. Why is content marketing so valuable? Because if it’s done properly, you’re providing useful and relevant information to those who flock to Google and other search engines looking for answers to their questions. Every business wants to be ranked near the top of search results for keywords or phrases most relevant to their business, products or industry. Google used to use the number (and quality) of links from other websites as the most influential factor when they ranked websites. That was before they discovered unethical “black hat” SEO companies were artificially manipulating results through the use of fake websites called “link farms” as well as other tactics. Now Google has overhauled their algorithms and begun rewarding websites that produce relevant and fresh information. How does this actually impact online marketing? When done correctly, companies that produce regular content (such as blog posts) on a consistent basis often see a huge jump in traffic. Why does this have such an impact on online traffic? The speculation within the industry is that Google wants to reward websites that provide information that is most helpful to users searching for the best answers. So if you’re a healthcare practice that consistently provides quality answers to questions asked by potential patients, Google will index your content and reward you by showing it to a larger audience. How well does this work? Take a look at the Google analytics for one of our clients, an OB/GYN clinic. They began blogging on a consistent basis just over two years ago. As you can see, the number of sessions (basically site visits) increased from approximately 10,000 to more than 45,000 per month. The number of pageviews jumped from around 16,000 to 55,000+. The average duration of each site visit decreased from an average of 1:05 to about 35 seconds – we think this number changed because of the huge increase in mobile users/visitors (those looking up the site for its new address and directions. Still, in nearly every other key analytic category we’ve seen impressive results. Now, can we say that blogging is the only reason for such dramatic results? Probably not. We are implementing other tactics for them that also contribute – but these are also based on the strategy of creating and sharing content via social media channels, newsletters and other outlets. While nobody (other than their engineers) completely knows how Google’s search algorithms work, the company does release information and provide general guidance to webmasters who want to follow best practices (and earn high rankings). And they have confirmed that sites that consistently produce information most relevant to their users are conforming to their recommended best practices. Good content creation doesn’t just happen overnight. It requires careful thought and analysis based on your industry, customers and trends. As a business owner (or manager), you are already an expert in your field – you already know what questions your customers (or patients) ask most frequently. Use this knowledge to plan out your first 5-10 articles or posts. Think about which questions you get asked the most related to your business or industry. Most likely, there are hundreds (or thousands) of others who are asking the exact same questions – but in Google. Don’t you want to be the one providing the right answer? If you don’t have time to write the posts yourself, consider investing in a freelance writer – it’s probably not as expensive as you think. Check out the site Zerys – you can post your topic, number of words desired, tone of article, etc. and have writers bid on the project (usually on a per word basis). It will take some trial and error to find the writer(s) you feel work best for your situation – and it will also still take time to edit and massage the articles most likely. But if done correctly, it will get you 80% there. Building and managing a small business is hard work. Believe me, as a fellow business owner I understand the challenges most SMBs face when you have one (or a few) people wearing multiple hats trying to keep up with all of the demands that come with the responsibilities. In an ideal world you will have the budget and resources to manage multiple marketing programs that help increase your visibility. But if you only had to pick one – go with content creation.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, September 8, 2016 Updated: 5:00 PM, September 8, 2016 BRUSSELS - U.S. tech giants Google <GOOGL.O> and Facebook <FB.O> are among multinationals spending more in Brussels as the European Commission eyes new business regulation after last week handing Apple a 13-billion-euro tax demand. A new annual filing by Google to the EU's Transparency Register showed it spent roughly 15-20 percent more on lobbying European Union officials and lawmakers last year than in 2014, itself some three times as much as in the year before that. A review by Reuters of EU lobbying budgets of a handful of leading U.S. firms which have been in the spotlight of European regulatory debates showed Google among the biggest spenders of all corporations, reporting a budget of 4.25-4.50 million euros ($4.8-5.1 million) in 2015. That compared to 3.5-4.0 million euros the year before and 1.25-1.5 million euros in 2013. A spokesman for the company, which has been served with three sets of charges in the past two years by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, said its 14 staff involved in lobbying in Brussels were there to provide information. "European politicians have many questions for Google and about the Internet. We're working hard to answer those questions, helping policymakers understand our business and the opportunity for European businesses to grow online," he said. Google's annual Transparency Register filing, publicized on Wednesday by anti-corruption group Transparency International, appeared online coincidentally on Aug. 30. On that day European Competition Commissioner Vestager ordered Apple to pay a record $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland after ruling that the U.S. firm had effectively had illegal subsidies from Dublin. The iPhone maker did not respond to a request for comment on its lobbying in Brussels, where it has been advertising since July for a new government affairs manager to "represent Apple's position with policymakers". Its EU declaration of spending a modest 800,000-900,000 euros last year and employing just five staff working part-time on lobbying has prompted speculation that it may have underplayed its hand -- though EU officials insist that they are not influenced by high-pressure corporate lobbying. WAKING UP Daniel Freund from the Brussels office of Transparency International said businesses could benefit from devoting resources to relationships with EU officials in a city where an expansion of regulatory powers for the Commission and European Parliament in the past few years has seen Brussels start to rival Washington in numbers of professional lobbyists. "A strong lobbying presence would smooth relations with the EU institutions, establish personal relationships, prevent spats," Freund said. "The (2009) Lisbon Treaty means more competences have shifted to Brussels and companies are waking up to this fact." Facebook, whose WhatsApp messaging service could be affected by an upcoming reform of the EU's telecoms rules and which also has an interest in new data protection rules, spends much less than Google -- 700,000-800,000 euros last year -- but is expanding its small team of people lobbying for it in Brussels. A staff that numbered just two last year is now four and a fifth person is being recruited, a spokeswoman said. "Our team has increased in size as our company has grown and as such we are currently recruiting one extra person," she said. Its advert for a Public Policy Manager reads: "As Facebook has become part of the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world, policy makers in many countries naturally wish to talk to us, and we wish to talk to them." Google's spending surge has come since Vestager's arrival in 2014 brought what many competition experts see as a more confrontational approach from the Commission. It is now similar to that of Microsoft, according to the latter's public filing. Microsoft, which lost heavily in the European court after years of legal battles with the Commission over its market dominance that began in the 1990s, declined comment. Amazon, which faces a similar tax investigation to Apple related to its relations with the Luxembourg government, declined comment. It employs six people on EU lobbying with a budget of 1.5-1.75 million euros, according to its filing. Uber, the ride hailing app company which has lobbied the Commission to do more to open up national taxi and transport markets to its smartphone-based services, has built a presence in Brussels over the past two years and now employs three people with a budget of 400,000-500,000 euros. Of global tech firms not based in the United States, Apple's smartphone competitor Samsung spent 2.5-2.75 million euros last year with a staff of nine, its Transparency Register filing shows. The South Korean company declined to comment.

If you’re in the business of selling holidays online it’s worth swotting up on the Google Panda Update. Put simply: Google‘s latest development could impact massively your website’s rankings. The update is a development in Google’s algorithm, designed to help people find more high-quality websites from search. Initially tested in the US, at the beginning of this week it was rolled out globally to all English-language Google users. Search behaviours have changed, just like Google’s algorithm, so if your search strategy is still about trying to out-smart Google’s algorithm, working the loopholes and simulating relevance, then it’s time to re-think your approach. Google values three main things:  Structure, content and authority and it’s always trying to improve the results it returns based on these three pillars. This means your content creation and link building should be inspired by your customers and you should be aiming to cultivate genuine authority for your brand. So we have ten tips for travel brands trying to build their website’s authority, which are ethical and will ensure you aren’t negatively impacted by Panda and future updates. 1. Create something amazing! Interesting, insightful or entertaining content will always win and naturally attract links from other websites. So consider creating useful tools, video or resources, which you can talk about to attract visitors and links. 2. Encourage sharing. “Likes” and “Re-tweets” are now widely accepted as clear signals of a web-page’s reputation which helps Google decide how important you are. So if everyone’s talking about the amazing guide to Cyprus on your Cyprus page, Google is likely to recognise this and reward the page with higher rankings. Once you’ve created something amazing why wouldn’t you make it easy for people to share with their friends and colleagues? Adding social sharing buttons like ‘Tweet this” and “Like this” to your website is simple and helps create a buzz online about your brand. Also keep an eye out for the imminent launch of Google’s own +1 button which you can add to your web pages to help encourage sharing of your amazing content. 3. Get to know the relevant media and engage in conversations. Comment on blogs and in forums and add to the discussion, using links in signatures or on profiles. Although not all will benefit SEO they still help to create a natural link profile and build a solid reputation, which will open up other link building opportunities and attract visitors to your website. 4. Apply to directory sites that are relevant to your industry and product. Online directories are just like phone books. As long as you choose genuinely relevant directories, it’s absolutely an ethical way to build your website’s reputation. 5. Look for ways to work with sites to add value. Rather than pushing your brand or products onto websites, take the time to build a relationship. By finding out what websites need or want you’re more likely to come away with a result you both benefit from, as well as opening up more opportunities to work together in the future. Websites are often screaming out for good quality, insightful or  interesting content, so contact a few blogs in your area of expertise and offer to write a guest post in exchange for a credit (and a link). 6. Amplify your existing PR activity. It doesn’t always have to be about creating something new. Take a look at the materials your marketing and PR teams have created; they may already have created great assets, which with good media knowledge could be leveraged as link magnets. 7. Don’t use link brokers. Links have become a saleable entity on the web and buying them has become part of the online economy. However, they’re against Google’s terms and conditions, so the ‘benefit’ can be removed at any time. Plus they’re only rented so they can also be removed at any time! 8. Don’t pay for editorial coverage. Paid for editorial coverage is called an advertorial – which put plainly is advertising. If you create something amazing, editorial sites will be falling over themselves to write about  it (and link to it) – so why pay for something you could get for free? If you want to build genuine brand authority get into your customers mindset, research the media networks they interact with and create something that appeals to these networks and their readers. 9. Don’t setup unrelated reciprocal links. Reciprocal links can be beneficial when they’re individually managed through relevant websites. However, there’s no benefit from exchanging links with websites that have nothing to do with your industry or product – so don’t waste your time! 10. Don’t copy content. Google doesn’t like identical content duplicated all over the web and neither do online publishers. You can spot regurgitated, re-written content, built-just-for-search engines a mile off, so if you’re contacting websites with something to offer, make sure it’s original and tailored to the website’s audience.

Reply 5 years ago   Krsna If we publish a relevant article related to a post of our Website at Google Blogpost and Tumblr with a deep link to the Website’s article itself? Does it will be an ethical way of building one-way text links? Please suggest. Reply 6 years ago   Travel Copywriting A useful article, great to hear the experts say what we have thought for a while that content is king albeit good quality, relevant, interesting and unique content. We set up Travel Copywriting a year ago with the aim to help the travel community have better content and to help aspiring travel writers get paid work. Not everyone has the time or abilities to write great content themselves so our writers do it for them. We have been outsourcing our services to a number of clients and have seen very positive results. In particular on Adventure Sports Holidays (our own site admittedly!) we have been adding 10,000+ words a month in the form of blogs, guides and articles and have seen traffic to our site more than double year on year for the first 1/4 of 2011. I am sure this is in a large part down to the constant addition of new, interesting and unique content.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google vanquishes Quadrooter flaws in September Android security patch Software Google vanquishes Quadrooter flaws in September Android security patch By Bindu Nair - Google has finally vanquished the Quadrooter vulnerability in its latest Android security bulletin for the month of September. The tech giant has further broken down its release into three security patch level strings to provide greater flexibility for its Android partners. To recap, the Quadrooter flaw first reared its head about a month ago and is composed of four different vulnerabilities. According to security firm Check Point, the issue could potentially affect over 900 million Android devices which were powered by Qualcomm SoCs. Left untreated, Quadrooter could allow hackers to gain access to a person’s phone via a malicious app, letting them remotely control their smartphone. Post this scare, Google issued a statement clarifying that its August security patch shields people from 3 out of 4 of these flaws. Also Read: Android 7.0 Nougat starts rolling out for Nexus devices The latest September patch now takes care of the last one left vulnerable namely CVE-2016-5340. Google was also quick to point out that its long-standing Verify Apps and SafetyNet features are meant to identify and get rid of malicious apps which could cause havoc by exploiting problems like Quadrooter. Google’s pre-existing safety mechanisms seems to have done an adequate job in protecting Android devices. The company claims there have been no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse arising from the new issues covered in the September bulletin. The September Android security patch is now being beamed out as a single OTA update to Nexus devices and should roll out to other products soon.

The move is among a series of steps taken recently by Dianne Greene, the highly regarded enterprise computing executive who now runs Google's cloud computing division, to make Google a central player in corporate computing. For Box, the deal represents an opportunity to broaden its suite of applications and potentially reach new customers who now use Google Docs. Box will serve as a "third-party content repository" for Google Docs, according to the announcement. Box shares jumped 2 percent on the news to $14.52 on the New York Stock Exchange, its highest price in a year. Alphabet shares were down a fraction at $807.99 on the Nasdaq. Box Chief Executive Officer Aaron Levie said in an interview that the goal was to bring "modern productivity tools" to a neutral platform where customers could integrate software and services from a variety of companies. He pointed to similar deals to integrate Microsoft's 360 software application - which compete with Google Docs - with Box. The trend, he said, was toward "more interoperability between companies." He praised Greene and Google for pursuing collaboration. "In the past nine months, we've seen huge investment in the ecosystem," Levie said. Companies including Google, Amazon.com Inc, International Business Machines Corp and others are all racing for a piece of the next-generation corporate computing business as big companies increasingly move their computing operations to big shared data centers known as the cloud.

Contents 1 History 2 Prefs 3 Documentation 4 Engineering 4.1 Code walkthrough 5 QA 6 Telemetry 7 Links History Google Safe Browsing was an anti-phishing extension released by Google on labs.google.com in December 2005. Google has released this extension to the Mozilla Foundation under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 in order that it might be used as part of Firefox if desired. We've landed this change on the trunk as a global extension as of 7 March 2006. You can read the discussion that lead up to to its integration in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329292 Google started migrating their Safe Browsing to version 4 of the protocol in 2015. We are currently working on integrating V4 in our code base with a incremental approach. That is, we will be landing V4 patches progressively and leave the V2 stack up and running until the V4 is extensively tested and the Shavar server has been upgraded to V4. In other words, V2 and V4 will co-exist for a while to ensure we don't break Safe Browsing. See the V4 implementation plan for the milestones and bugs involved.

Sounds confusing? Well in its most simple form, SEO relates to trying to get your website listed as high up in the Google or Bing search results page as possible. In theory, the higher up your site appears in the search results, the more likely you are to gaining additional traffic to your event website. Simple stuff right? Let’s get started on some basic tips so you can get started. SEO Audit Before you start on your SEO journey, it is important to understand where you currently stand in terms of SEO and your site. To do this, we recommend carrying out an SEO audit. There are great free resources available out there that will help you analyse your site, along with helping your efforts in terms of keyword research and competitor analysis. Try SEMrush Site Audit to get started. Create a sitemap Building a sitemap for your website ensures that you can be found when a topic or search term is inputted into the Google search engine. Sometimes you might want to hide a certain page or blog article from your website if it’s no longer timely, but you can still index this page by adding it to your sitemap. The more URLs you index with Google, the better chance you have of appearing in their search rankings. A clear sitemap allows Google to understand your website and the happier Google is with your site, the higher you show in their rankings. For more information on building a sitemap click here. Keywords throughout website When writing content for your website you want to think about the search terms that a user would use if they were searching for information about a given topic. This does not mean using the keywords in every sentence, as search engines will recognise this spamming technique and you could ultimately be disadvantaged in the search results rankings. Place the keywords within the title and near the top of your content for best results. Using long-tail keywords (3-4 word phrases specific to your offering) can also be very effective in increasing relevance. If you have an idea of a phrase that a user is likely to search for that’s specific to your content, then use this long-tailed keyword to improve your chances of gaining a higher ranking. Start a blog! By adding a blog to your website and ensuring you update it regularly, with relevant information, is a great way of improving SEO and gaining more traffic to your site. Every new blog is essentially another URL that can be added to your sitemap and gives you more content to plug-in keywords. The more content and keywords you can include in your website, the more likely Google will be able to find relevant information on your site to suggest to users in the search results. Pretty simple huh? Just remember, although producing more content is going to, in theory, help with SEO, there is no point in creating content for content’s sake. Ensure you balance the ‘quality vs quantity’ spectrum and adhere to producing blog entries that are likely to benefit your target audience. Inbound link building Utilising social media is a great way to promote that blog content you’ve just created and provide another platform for users to reach your website. You can also gain additional traffic through referrals from external websites that post links back to your site. How? Well, there are plenty of ways to achieve this. Try to build partnerships with relevant publishers who will find your original content relevant and are able to post this content to their own site (with links back to the original source, i.e. your website). Are you sending press releases to relevant industry websites? By having these published on various sites you’ll experience additional inbound traffic from external sources. Ensure you review inbound links from time to time so you know that the sources referring traffic are those you want to be associated with (i.e. completely relevant to your event/site). So there you have it! A very basic introduction to SEO. It’s a subject that can get quite complex and requires a certain level of experience to really capitalise on gaining the most from SEO. But even some very simple steps can be taken immediately that will boost your site traffic and help to bring in some additional ticket sales for your event.

 Google's cloud chief explains why she partnered with Box when she already has a competing product Eugene Kim Sep. 7, 2016, 3:58 PM 1,970 facebook linkedin twitter email print Diane GreeneBusiness Insider Google and Box just announced a pretty significant partnership that could be a sign of more things to come.  Under the new partnership, Google Docs users will now be able to edit and collaborate directly within Box while also saving files in Box's cloud platform. It's a new development in the enterprise file storage industry because Google Drive already has a similar service that lets users store and edit files. At BoxWorks on Wednesday, Google's cloud chief Diane Greene explained why the partnership makes sense, despite competing with Box in the same space. She said: "It’s really fun to work with other companies. I think that’s the huge appeal for me of Google Cloud, taking it out to every company and partnering with all these companies and every company is so interesting. We aren’t going to build it all." Greene also added that Google is actively forming partnerships in the broader work and productivity space, including in the infrastructure level where things like data analysis and machine learning is increasingly becoming important. She said: "We’re also just in general partnering with companies in the cloud a lot around helping them moving to the cloud and working with their data. So we’re taking our world class engineers and having them work with our customers and it’s really well-received from both sides." Broader partnerships is just one of the many things Greene has brought to Google Cloud since being hired last November to lead the company's cloud efforts. She's expanded the company's enterprise sales team while creating the office of the CTO to handle technical questions and larger customer needs. She's also created smaller units to focus on specific industries, like finance or retail. But the new partnership also brings to question how serious Google is in the enterprise file storage space. According to a recent Gartner report, Google wasn't in the "leaders" category, and is considered to be lagging behind smaller players like Box, Dropbox, and Egnyte. And it doesn't seem like Google will surprise its partners by secretly investing in a competing product, according to Greene. "People are sometimes surprised, and ask, 'Aren’t you building that?' No, no, we will partner, but we will never surprise you. If we’re building it, you’ll know," she said.

[Photo: Flickr user Manel] Steven Melendez 09.07.16 4:30 PM An experimental division of Google parent Alphabet is harnessing Google’s advertising technology to help stop the spread of ISIS. "ISIS is a terrorist group unlike any that we’ve seen before," says Yasmin Green, the head of research and development at Jigsaw, an internal tech incubator focusing on international security issues. "They’ve been successful in capturing both physical territory and digital territory." The extremist group has reportedly lost physical territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months, but security experts have long warned that its sophisticated media strategy—involving videos, social media, and even glossy print publications—still enables the group to attract supporters from around the world. "With the widespread horizontal distribution of social media, terrorists can identify vulnerable individuals of all ages in the United States—spot, assess, recruit, and radicalize—either to travel or to conduct a homeland attack," Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey told Congress last year. "The foreign terrorist now has direct access into the United States like never before." Jigsaw, formerly known as Google Ideas, concluded an 8-week pilot program earlier this year, using the same technologies that let commercial advertisers target internet users most likely to be interested in their products to identify users demonstrating sympathies toward ISIS. Then, says Green, online ads pointed them toward content, in both English and Arabic, delivering alternative viewpoints in ways that can actually change their minds. "They usually made their decision to join [ISIS] based on partial information," she says of those who've joined the terror group in the past. "That’s really the bet we’re making here, is that with better information, individuals will be empowered to make better choices." Before launching the test campaign, members of the Jigsaw team did extensive field research, meeting with former ISIS sympathizers and members of targeted communities from Iraq to London, trying to understand everything from how they use mobile phones to what motivated their initial sympathies for the terror group. They then formulated an advertising campaign targeting internet users whose search keywords indicated a potential for radicalization, not just an interest in mainstream news coverage of terrorism or events in the Middle East. "We were factoring in these types of things: supportive slogans, deferential terms for the Islamic State, preferences for ISIS-produced content," says Green. For instance, ISIS sympathizers are more likely to use an Arabic-language slogan meaning "remaining and expanding," and they're more likely to use certain terminology for the group itself and political concepts it embraces, like the return of the Islamic political institution known as the caliphate, she says. A Google advertising tool called the Keyword Planner, which uses Google’s substantial data collections to suggest additional relevant keywords to target for an ad campaign, helped find additional terms to target with ads, she says. And while the company didn’t do any offline tracking of targeted users, so it can’t say how many people may have actually been dissuaded from joining ISIS, it still saw encouraging signs from the pilot. "Over 8 weeks, in Arabic and English, that this pilot ran, it reached an estimated 320,000 unique individuals, half of which we believed showed signs of positive sentiment toward the Islamic State," Green says. And, she says, the click-through rate of the ads Jigsaw placed were on average 70% higher than others targeting the same keywords. But simply placing advertisements is only half the battle: Green and her team also had to decide what kinds of content those ads would promote. They quickly decided to curate existing content online, rather than producing new material, but that still left a lot of choices to be made. And sending users to videos or blog posts that just offer "facile parody" of ISIS, use terminology that's seen as overly derogatory, or simply come off as overly preachy will just alienate the people Jigsaw is trying to reach, she says. "It turns out a lot of the content being produced in this space, I liken it to showing smokers their lungs with nicotine [damage] on the side of the cigarette packet," she says. And even mainstream Western news sources, like the BBC, can be seen as biased by potential ISIS recruits, Green says the team learned through field research. They decided, instead, to focus on citizen journalism and documentary footage showing the realities of life under ISIS and the struggles the group has been having militarily, along with material highlighting the religious debate around some of the Islamic concepts ISIS cites and testimony from former ISIS supporters who had left the group. "Those were among the most compelling," Green says. "These were individuals who had just come back—they were until very recently subscribing to ISIS ideology." Ultimately, users targeted by the ads collectively watched about 500,000 minutes of video, she says. And as the project expands, Green hopes to work with external funding organizations and advertising groups to expand to other languages and potentially even enable deradicalization experts to work one-on-one with potential ISIS recruits who are posting on YouTube and social media networks. The efforts may one day expand to combat other forms of extremism, such as white supremacist movements, she says. Since shortly after it was founded in 2010 as Google Ideas, the group has been in contact with former extremists of a variety of stripes, looking to learn why young people are drawn to such movements. Jigsaw’s project isn’t the only effort to focus on countering ISIS propaganda: Obama administration officials have met with executives from Hollywood movie studios and social media companies like Snapchat and Facebook to discuss ways to limit and counter the group’s global reach. And while the pilot program arose within Alphabet, a company central to internet advertising, Green says there’s no reason a similar project couldn’t begin elsewhere. "There’s no really secret sauce here," she says. "This is really just about setting the target audience as those who already engaged, informing the campaigns with insights from defectors and former members, and getting the insights to design really good campaigns."

Move Beyond the Google Search Box More than ever, your customers’ and prospects’ attention is scattered in 100 digital directions. You can't rely on Google alone to help customers find your company and to cater to your brand fans. Customers' online journeys take them all over the place. They travel online like a blindfolded unicyclist bouncing down a mountain trail, at night, in a snowstorm.  With four out of every 10 people finding visuals more engaging than text, brands have an incredible opportunity to show up with the right image at the right place and time — to capture that magical moment when a Twitter user sees a tweet linking to an Instagram post, clicks through to the second social network and immediately sees an apparel brand tagged in that Instagram post. Within seconds, a pair of shoes (or watch or hat) is in that user’s shopping cart, ready to be purchased. Digital marketing and customer experience today veers increasingly toward serendipity — where finding something online by chance is a very real likelihood. We spend hours on end browsing feeds and clicking on anything that attracts our interest.  Why shouldn’t that interest come from a brand on occasion?  Google search is still a great way to connect with audiences, but marketers are now challenged to be wherever consumers go, utilizing new methods that may be less direct and more unexpected. Witness it in the methods behind hashtag marketing and analytics on Instagram, Pinterest embracing visual search and Twitter letting users add stickers to their photos that function like hashtags.  Here’s how to capitalize on an increasingly visual social media world ripe for chance encounters between users and brands. Use Serendipity to Your Digital Marketing Advantage Keeping up with new ways for brands to engage with consumers (and, consumers to engage with brands) can feel overwhelming.  Social marketing success requires us to challenge our assumptions about the channels where users love to get lost. Think of it as an opportunity for companies to capitalize on methods in which serendipity reigns — and embrace the art (and in some cases, science) of being there for your audiences’ unstructured journey of discovery. Defining what it means to search for and find a brand or product is changing, but companies shouldn’t fear this sort of serendipitous search. Instead, find the opportunities to take advantage of it. Start thinking bigger about what a well-planned and context-aware digital experience can do for content discovery. In many ways, serendipitous journeys take some of the control out of the digital experience — both for the user and the brand. That doesn’t mean brands should sit back and let things happen.  When I think about the changing social interaction landscape, my mind goes to the hashtag marketing and Pinterest visual search described above. But there’s more. Ditto Labs has created a visual search algorithm for businesses to apply to their social media accounts. The algorithm analyzes photos across each channel and identifies brand logos to reveal whose products appear in an image. This info — along with who is sharing it — presents tremendous opportunities to seek out everyday brand ambassadors and connect your brand with an individual or audience. With Ditto, a brand would see when a guy wearing a Nike cap, Ray-Ban sunglasses and North Face jacket uploaded a photo of himself to Instagram. Any of those brands using Ditto’s tech could conceivably reach out to the individual to gauge his openness to having the photo shared on their own account. Commit to a Wider-Reaching DX Strategy With an eye toward serendipitous search and discovery, it’s important to understand and acknowledge all the places and ways prospects can discover your brand.  Consumers won’t press “purchase” until they’ve gathered all the information they need. In fact, they may not be buyers until that fortunate moment when “need” or “want” crosses social media paths with your brand or product. Creating a strategy that lets them bump into your brand while searching on the sites they already visit can provide some inspiration, introduce or reinforce your brand promise, and social media users amass information that allows them to take action. Being on the right social platforms with the right hashtags and the right messaging can indicate that you understand your unique audience and what they’re looking for when they pick up a phone, tablet or laptop.  And you quickly turn a moment of serendipity into a valuable brand interaction. The rise of alternative search and discovery options doesn’t spell the end of the digital experience as we know it. But it does mean that brand marketers need to expand their approach and make room for the ways today’s consumers interact with their surroundings. We’ve barely scratched the surface with the possibilities around search and discovery options, and new techniques are continually coming to life for immersive, visual, omnipresent discovery.  Think about this: Now that consumers everywhere are armed with a camera and an internet connection, we’re not far from the time when every object could be searchable. For brands, it’s a massive opportunity to expand reach, catch consumers’ attention in the right place at the right time, and ultimately make a connection that pays off for the customer and for your brand.

Thanks to machine-learning algorithms, Google Photos can detect the landmarks in your photos. Third-party developers can use these powerful algorithms in their own apps, too, and Google is trying to sell them on why they should. Google uses a multi-step process, which its developers refer to as a "landmark mining pipeline," to identify which point of interest you've caught in front of your lens. Here's how it works, according to a post on Google's engineering blog: "If the pipeline identifies an image as a possible landmark, it is sent to the next step of the pipeline for clustering. Photos are then clustered in two ways: by geolocation data and by visual match. One cluster is mapped to a single landmark. For example, a cluster could include multiple photos of the Statue of Liberty taken at different angles, some with objects in the foreground, and some with textual metadata that helps identify the landmark. Once a cluster is identified, the pipeline generates the associated metadata for the landmark: its name, Knowledge Graph mid, and latitude / longitude coordinates. Clusters that aren't associated with a real landmark are discarded." The secret weapon is that, thanks to all those different angles and metadata, the algorithms can identify not only the landmark, but also whether or not you've taken a photo of something similar. Did you visit the Statue of Liberty replica in Paris's River Seine? Google knows. Snap a picture of the mini Eiffel Tower at Las Vegas's Paris Hotel? Google will tell you. //Related Articles 17 Tricks to Master Google Photos Using a Google Cloud API, third-party apps and websites can send Google a picture of a landmark and get back its name, latitude and latitude coordinates, and a "bounding box" indicating where the landmark was found in the image. There is a catch, however. The landmarks-recognition algorithm also computes a match score, which reflects how confident it is that the image is actually a landmark. The score must be above a certain threshold to be recognized. Developers have been able to use this API since last December, as part of a suite of machine-learning algorithms that can recognize characters, offensive content, faces, logos, and more. But accurate image recognition is a serious technological hurdle, and Google's decision to walk developers through the process is likely intended to boost the number of API calls so it can increase its algorithm's confidence level.

Seems like Google found that test a little suspect. Big G pumps out Chrome updates on a regular (and rather rapid) cadence, and over the past twelve months  they’ve put a lot of effort into making it more efficient. According to a blog post they just published, those efforts have really paid off. The version of Chrome that its users are browsing with today is about 25% easier on laptop batteries than the one they used last year. Google’s comparison video shows two Surface Books running Chrome side-by-side, one with version 46 and the other running the current stable build (53). At the 8:27 mark, the older version packs it in. The latest Chrome keeps the good times rolling for another 2 hours and 25 minutes. That’s a very different result than the one we saw from Microsoft’s tests. In case you missed their browser battery rundown, Microsoft’s setup looked a lot like Google’s except with a big digital time clock perched on top. In the Microsoft test, the Surface Book running Chrome only lasted a little over 4 hours. Edge — which won the contest handily — squeezed out another 3 hours. But even Edge fell well short of the 10-plus hours Chrome managed in Google’s test. Either there are some major differences in the two testing methods, or Microsoft has done some terrific work on the Surface Book’s overall battery life. Any way you slice it, it’s great to know that everybody seems very intent on making our laptops last as long as possible between charges.

Comments By Blair Hanley Frank Follow IDG News Service | Sep 7, 2016 11:29 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Cloud Storage Enterprise Applications IT Industry Google G Suite Google Comments For a very long time, Google has focused on building its own productivity software to serve everyone from consumers to massive enterprises, and then locking people into its core experience. That all changed on Wednesday. The company announced that it's partnering with Box to let users of the enterprise cloud storage and content services platform edit documents with Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, but keep them stored inside Box. It's a vast departure from the company's previous direction, which required people to store files edited with Docs inside Google Drive. Google said that the company is working on turning its Docs productivity suite into an open platform, and is open to working with other storage providers in a similar way. Google Drive will still remain the default storage system for Docs, Sheets and Slides, even as the company pushes its open platform strategy. The move provides security advantages for shared users of Box and Google Docs. Administrators will be able to manage access to documents using the same Box management console that they're used to, while still letting users work with the Docs suite. It's also a boon for end users, who will be able to find documents from Google's productivity suite in the same cloud storage system where they keep other files. In order to use Google Docs with Box, enterprise customers will need a paid Google Apps subscription. Consumers will be able to use Box as the storage service for Google Docs for free. The move is emblematic of Google's heightened enterprise focus under the leadership of Diane Greene, the executive vice president of Google Cloud Enterprise. Greene has been instrumental in forging partnerships aimed at appealing to large businesses, something that Google hasn't always succeeded at. Other recent moves have included an expanded partnership with Okta focused around providing enterprises with identity management services. Google and Box will also work together on making Box content available in Google Springboard, an artificial intelligence-powered assistant aimed at giving employees the information they need from a variety of services, including Gmail, Google Calendar and third-party services like Box. The two companies haven't said when the fruits of their partnership will actually appear. But the move means that both companies' products could become more appealing -- enterprises using Google Apps might be more likely to subscribe to Box, and vice versa.

How about a Google one? Half of Americans would consider it, even though neither company is currently selling any vehicles. That’s according to a TECHnalysis Research survey, which sampled 1,000 US residents who currently own a car and plan on buying a new one in the next two years. It asked all kinds of questions about which car brands people would and would not consider, and just happened to include Apple and Google. Watch Live The results were surprising. Half of respondents said they would at least consider an Apple or Google car, with Google having a slight edge. One in ten said they’d definitely buy a Google or Apple car. It’s all hypothetical, though. While there are widespread reports that Apple is building a car, nothing has been confirmed. And while Google’s famous self-driving car is learning new tricks, like how to honk, the company hasn’t so much as hinted at a release date. So Google and Apple cars won’t be on the market next year, or the year after that. But they might be someday, and this survey suggests they’ll have at least a little bit of branding power without even putting in effort. Look out, Detroit.

John Mueller of Google said this at the 44:30 mark into yesterday's hangout on YouTube Live. He said "we are working on an announcement for that there, so like when it's ready we will let you know." That means, Google is already working with press and whomever to make sure they get the Penguin announcement clear and right. John then answered if the Penguin announcement will come before or after it goes live and John said "I don't know about before but we will try to get the the timing so that we don't confuse everyone." So clearly, Google is taking this Penguin release seriously and if they are working on the announcement, it has to be coming fairly soon? As you know, some thought the weekend update was related to Penguin, it was not. It is now over a year and 10 months, almost two years since Penguin 3.0 launched in October 2014.

I was wondering about this wording, so I watched the video: he said we are working on an announcement for "that though." It does kind of sound like "those," especially with his thick accent... he rolls "though" into his next word "so." Ethan Brown 09/07/2016 12:00 pm That's right, Correct it barry. Richard 09/07/2016 12:00 pm If it got it out of the door tomorrow I'd be happy with an announcement that consisted of the single phrase: "Here ya go!" Barry Schwartz 09/07/2016 12:01 pm I did correct it. Ethan Brown 09/07/2016 12:02 pm Thank you. whatsheorderfishfilet 09/07/2016 12:08 pm Jeez, I hope "Correct it barry" is lost in translation -- it's a hobby blog, you know? He could delete the whole post and put up a picture of a cat, if he preferred. Be a little polite. Mihai Aperghis 09/07/2016 12:11 pm Did you? Where's the cat picture then? Barry Schwartz 09/07/2016 12:11 pm Who said I like cats? :P Ethan Brown 09/07/2016 12:24 pm I didn't mean it that way, but I'm sorry, now you are.. Deadpool 09/07/2016 12:24 pm It will be a new Olympic discipline too: "The Penguin Launch". Abhishek Budholiya 09/07/2016 12:28 pm finally John say.... The Truth 09/07/2016 12:30 pm it's not going to help anyone. Google has no interest in help people that were flagged for spam. It will end up penalizing more websites for something they didn't know was wrong. Dave 09/07/2016 12:43 pm Last Friday update?? there was one, Because I track thousands of keywords for my vertical sites and I had hundreds of keywords moving from third page plus, moving onto the first page. I also had increases of 25%+ of traffic on a like for like basis compared to comparable days earlier in the month . Anyway what ever update occurred has now been reversed and keywords and traffic have reverted back to Pre-Friday positions. Maybe, just maybe they pushed out part of Penguin and reversed it ready for the big release and announcement? Anon User 09/07/2016 01:11 pm Google press statement re Penguin 4.0 "Sorry for the delay, the false release innuendos, the constant pushbacks. Today we are officially announcing that Penguin 4.0 will be released after Christmas so as not to impact the holiday period" Deja Vu anyone? Dave 09/07/2016 01:18 pm 2026 will be after Christmas Billy Mays 09/07/2016 01:38 pm That's hilarious, I'd fuck with you too if you just annoyed me for a few years with the same question. Next week I would tell you that we are working on coding the press release. Jerry Martinez 09/07/2016 02:00 pm Lol, it definitely sounds like a tongue in cheek comment. "Working on launch announcement" hahahah... they will announce that its not going to be running anymore or simply claim that it's "real time" while everyone sees virtually no movement because there really wasn't one. Oh well. As much as I was eager for the next Penguin I don't really give a damn anymore, people that are still waiting on it would be far better off if they started a parallel project... then they'd have 2 websites provided the penguin hit site actually even recovered. SerpsViolator 09/07/2016 02:13 pm Matt and John both told us of your cat obsession, don't play coy! veneno 09/07/2016 03:16 pm if this occurs in a short period time, will be great news... IF IF IF josh bachynski (SEO) 09/07/2016 03:33 pm Barry, they lie to you. They do test penguin before releasing it, and if they are close enough to say they are getting ready to launch it then *this was the getting ready part.* ;p Don Halbert 09/07/2016 04:02 pm you've always sort of reminded me of a crazy cat lady Barry. ;) Michael Martinez 09/07/2016 04:12 pm Because they NEVER test any other algorithms ... Nick Ker 09/07/2016 04:41 pm Great. Now you'll have people bugging you to bug John/Google about when the announcement will be made. After all, it has been over 24 hours since the last pre-announcement announcement. "Why won't they tell us when the announcement will be made?!" josh bachynski (SEO) 09/07/2016 05:11 pm i take your point :-) i do have other reasons to believe it is penguin of course - i am making a video to show my reasoning Ralph 09/07/2016 05:54 pm Josh, Our decent site is now out-ranked by some of the worst garbage I have ever seen. Could this be part of a test that will reverse itself? josh bachynski (SEO) 09/07/2016 06:05 pm possibly what is the SERP - paste the google search here and i will take a look for you Anon User 09/07/2016 06:15 pm Matt Cutts once complained that you tried to stroke his wifes pussy. Ralph 09/07/2016 06:52 pm just emailed you. thanks pierre NI 09/08/2016 12:24 am ok, got to comment on this. We think it is already on the way. One of our websites, whose most relevant keywords were out of 100, saw a significant change. 30 important keywords: Jumped from outside 100 to less than 30. Well, it is still jumping and dancing, but it is something we never saw before. Penguin is on the way. Jim Colson 09/08/2016 06:01 am By this update of google what good effects on search results or seo purpose ? Please confirm that. Krzysztof Furtak 09/08/2016 09:19 am Finally! But please don't tell me "you have to wait for next update to lift penguin penalty";) riki 09/08/2016 09:29 am just can't believe how many people think they will get penalty lifted with next Penguin release. I think it will be major disappointment for most penalized websites. I hope I am wrong but I think this new Penguin will be very different from the last one (Google had 2 years to rewrite the algo) and most probably will not touch most of penalized sites. There is a small possibility that Google has some kind of database of penalized sites(as seen on JohnMu's computer) and decides to be nice and lift a penalty for some websites, but algorithmically I don't think it will happen. Andrew Bullis 09/08/2016 11:49 am My guess was, and still is, October 3rd: http://www.andrewbullis.us/seo-blog/23-when-will-google-update-penguin Henry 09/08/2016 01:25 pm My guess is it is already out .... Jeff Fagan 09/08/2016 08:10 pm Just in time for the holiday shopping. What fun! Keith Winter 09/08/2016 09:25 pm Excellent catch Barry! Thanks for keeping us all up to date on what is said in these hangouts. Peter Boehm 09/09/2016 06:36 am I also seen much fluctuation with long tail keywords of my site.... is there any sign of google update... because my main keyword is stable but other related keywords goes out of 50 from 20.... Jimmy Yuh 09/10/2016 09:45 am Google is really crazy !!! Neha Walia 09/11/2016 05:03 am There is some updates are going on... i am seeing fluctuation in many keywords... Lala 09/11/2016 05:14 am Of course there are, since yesterday Neha Walia 09/11/2016 05:27 pm any one will say me about this update? Sphia Hike 09/12/2016 08:47 am Is Google Penguin update announced? Income Property Showcase 09/12/2016 09:53 am yes tomorrow is some google update by which my website keywords rank is going down. Robert Brown Farley 09/13/2016 01:35 am Always looking forward to see where different things occur. Every algorithm has its unique ups and downs and limitations... The newest Penguin release is well overdue - along with numerous others. At the end of the day persé the best anyone can hope for is that they have done their job to the best of their abilities. Amit Kumar 09/13/2016 06:27 am I am also having the same problem as my keywords are jumping and dancing from last few days.. any suggestion? Pooja 09/15/2016 06:06 am My ranking also fall from 2nd page to 8th page, if you have any idea on how to make it on first page, then please share it with me Cristi 09/15/2016 07:51 am I see the same fluctuations on many keywords and I see them on websites that were never spammed to begin with. The spammed ones (more than 4 years ago) are staying #1 or #2 in Google and that's very strange :) Ozair Akhtar (Oxair Online) 09/15/2016 06:42 pm I am seriously experiencing Penguin kind of update since the morning of 2nd Sept 2016. One of my keywords jump to page no.1 on 10th position and suddenly went down and then move to Page no.3 Though, I am currently working in Pakistani market but still the effect is widespread. I am seeing others experiencing the same on SERPs. Please advice what sort of links should we build now!!! prity saha 09/16/2016 02:04 am Do you know anything about SEO? I think you are new... it is not penguin..ok. prity saha 09/16/2016 02:09 am No.. it is not penguin... it is Google's core ranking algorithm .. and if you remember about the past... google said "Google Panda Is Now Part Of Google’s Core Ranking Signals" it means Google's core ranking algorithm update will auto update panda too. by this update - many SEO expert are confused even bigger SEO company CEO too. prity saha 09/16/2016 02:10 am It is not penguin... it is Google's core ranking algorithm .. and if you remember about the past... google said "Google Panda Is Now Part Of Google’s Core Ranking Signals" it means Google's core ranking algorithm update will auto update panda too. by this update - many SEO expert are confused even bigger SEO company CEO too. Ozair Akhtar (Oxair Online) 09/18/2016 08:14 am It's Kind of it as we are experiencing drop in ranking when we build even few links!!! Chris Rice 09/19/2016 05:59 pm You know there are major changes taking place when your rankings move 50+ positions in either direction. Looking forward to the announcement. Go Mungo SEO 09/21/2016 08:11 am Scenario 1 - At the time of the last Penguin 3# update site 1 had less than 10 dodgy links. I have since removed all dodgy links from site 1's backlink profile. Site 1 has earned some great links too in the last 2 years. As of this week site 1 has jumped back to the top of the SERPS. Scenario 2 - At the time of the last Pengun 3# update Site 2 had 50 + dodgy links. I have since got these dodgy links down to under 5. Site 2 has also earned a considerble amount of great links during the past 2 years too.. As of this week site 2 is just scraping page 1. I have disavowed these remaining links and reavowed them too, however no change. Cannot get to the top. Lesson learnt - I believe some sort of algo update has taken place that only affects link profiles that are completely clean eg. site 1. I believe we are waiting for the algo update that takes into account more complicated scenarios like site 2 eg. above. Fustration - if I could clean out all the bad links to site 2 too then I believe I will see considerable improvements in ranking. The only problem is that the webmasters of the last remaining links are non contactable, Believe me I have tried contacting them for 2 years now. I am hoping that the Penguin 4 update will flush out these remaining bad links when it asseses site 2's link profile and assume that everything has been done to clean up, and rank it alot better than it is, possible top ranking. This is a real example. blog comments powered by Disqus The pulse of the search community Subscribe Subscribe options ADVERTISERS Search buzz Video 11/11/2016 08:39 am Subscribe More videos Video Details Browse by: Browse by Date Find by Category Discover by Author Scan Most Recent See Comments View Tag Cloud SEM FORUM THREADS WebmasterWorld Forums Google to Ban AdSense Publishers With Fake News Sites Twitter Now Lets You "Mute" Keywords and Phrases Digital Point Forums Aggregate Rating Schema in Google Listing - is it worth nowdays ?

Jon Diorio from Google said on Google+ that he is "terribly excited" about this launch, adding "if you want to reduce the amount of time you spend monitoring and tracking performance against your goals, do go check it out." Create a campaign group: You can now package AdWords campaigns (including Video, Display, Search, and Shopping campaigns) into a single campaign group. For our holiday example, set up your YouTube and Display campaigns, select “campaign groups” from the left menu, and group those two campaigns together to create a campaign group called “Holiday Launch”. Set a performance target: Performance targets make it easier to monitor and reach your performance goals for each campaign group. Tell us how many clicks or conversions you want to receive, how much you want to spend, and what average CPC or CPA you wish to maintain. We'll then automatically show you a single view of how your campaign group is performing against those goals, and what we think you'll likely achieve by the end of the campaign period.

So we know that Google often won't show rich snippets if the site doesn't meet a certain (undocumented) threshold for quality. But did you know that if you do a site command on a site that has implemented rich snippets, Google should show the rich snippets regardless of that quality metrics? John Mueller said in a Google webmaster hangout at the 20:04 mark into the video: Usually, if you do a site query for a site, we will show the Rich Snippets if it's implemented technically correct. So that's a good way to kind of double-check that we can pick up the mark up properly and we're not showing it in normal search results then that's really a sign that we are essentially not sure about the quality of the website. So this is another good way to determine if you implemented rich snippets correctly. You don't just have to use the Google Structured Data Testing tool, you might be able to try the site command. Now if the rich snippets don't show for your site when you rank for normal queries, and it does show for the site command, then you may have a quality issue. Forum discussion at Google+. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Google AdWords Adds Campaign Groups & Performance Targets   Comments: Alex Smith 09/07/2016 02:05 pm Strange, as the Structured Data Testing tool does pick up on rich snippets on my websites correctly, without any warnings or errors. Yet using the site: operator on the same website doesn't show anything for them at all... Darvydas Šilkus 09/08/2016 06:46 am Same here. Try looking at Search Console -> Search Appearance -> Structured data if the URL itself has been marked as having the markup. The website I'm working on was seeing high indexing in Structured Data markup, but now it's standing still for two months. Only 20% of website was marked as having Product schema.org markup though. Kevin Smith 09/10/2016 12:41 pm Some websites not using schema markup but show rich snippet in google search but several website that has implemented schema on their webpage doesn't show any snippet in Google. what should be the reason behind this ? Patrick_D1985 09/13/2016 06:18 pm Have to agree on this. I have seen a lot of actually well structured website lack snippets. Is there some undisclosed quality guideline / treshold? Patrick_D1985 09/13/2016 06:21 pm Likewise. One main thing to keep in mind at this time is to include the Data Types Google actually is doing something with now. See; https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/data-type-selector But ofcourse Schema.org is a lot ahead when it comes to all possible structured data. IMO it should not hurt to already include 'future' stuff. blog comments powered by Disqus The pulse of the search community Subscribe Subscribe options ADVERTISERS Search buzz Video 11/11/2016 08:39 am Subscribe More videos Video Details Browse by: Browse by Date Find by Category Discover by Author Scan Most Recent See Comments View Tag Cloud SEM FORUM THREADS WebmasterWorld Forums Facebook to Fix Metrics Bugs in Insights Microsoft Takes Platinum Membership at The Linux Foundation Digital Point Forums Is Better Analytics Right for my company?

Jigsaw, Google’s technology incubator, has figured out words and phrases that people associated with ISIS often search for. The aim isn’t to track or identify them, but to change their minds; Jigsaw will seed the search results with ads that link to YouTube channels filled with anti-ISIS videos. “The Redirect Method is at its heart a targeted advertising campaign: Let’s take these individuals who are vulnerable to ISIS’ recruitment messaging and instead show them information that refutes it,” Yasmin Green, Jigsaw’s head of research and development, told Wired. The channels are populated with preexisting videos, such as testimonials from former extremists, or shots of long food lines in ISIS-controlled Raqqa, Syria. In a pilot project earlier this year, more than 300,000 people clicked over to Jigsaw’s YouTube channels over about two months. This month, the program will move into its next phase to target both ISIS recruits and white supremacists.

Box teams up with Google for Docs and Springboard integration Posted Sep 7, 2016 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Apple discontinues gold watch, adds ceramic Sure there’s some kind of fruit-related event going on right now, but this week is also BoxWorks, the annual conference for the enterprise content cloud platform provider. At that event, Box CEO Aaron Levie and Google’s SVP of Google’s cloud offerings Diane Greene are announcing a partnership that turns Box into a third-party storage option for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, and that makes Box-stored content searchable via Google Springboard. The tie-up makes Box a storage option for housing Google documents, spreadsheets and slide presentations, letting users of Google’s cloud-based productivity suite work directly from their existing Box-based storage repositories. That’s a useful addition for sure, because while a number of enterprise organizations use Google’s offerings for collaboration and creation, a decent number of those actually use Box for cloud-base storage since it’s the solution that was actually designed specifically for business use. The integration also means users go Google Springboard, the enterprise-focused search engine it revealed earlier this year that acts a digital assistant surfacing content from across an user’s Google Apps, and which employs AI to make smart recommendations about what info to present to users and when. The new Box link-up for Springboard will surface content stored in its enterprise accounts via search alongside Google-stored content. It may seem a little odd for Google to be collaborating with Box on cloud storage when Google has its own offering there, which is also a revenue driver for the search giant. But the partnership is actually only really likely to benefit customers of both groups, without really biting into the customer base of either, given the distinctions between what Box and Google Drive can provide. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Box Founded 2005 Overview After starting as a college business project in 2005, Box was officially launched in March of 2006 with the vision of connecting people, devices and networks.

Jigsaw, a Google-owned think tank, is redirecting potential recruits to the Islamic State away from radical Islamist propaganda and toward videos that debunk the terrorist group's promises: The program, which Jigsaw calls the Redirect Method and plans to launch in a new phase this month, places advertising alongside results for any keywords and phrases that Jigsaw has determined people attracted to ISIS commonly search for. Those ads link to Arabic- and English-language YouTube channels that pull together preexisting videos Jigsaw believes can effectively undo ISIS's brainwashing — clips like testimonials from former extremists, imams denouncing ISIS's corruption of Islam, and surreptitiously filmed clips inside the group's dysfunctional caliphate in Northern Syria and Iraq. "This came out of an observation that there's a lot of online demand for ISIS material, but there are also a lot of credible organic voices online debunking their narratives," says Yasmin Green, Jigsaw's head of research and development. "The Redirect Method is at its heart a targeted advertising campaign: Let's take these individuals who are vulnerable to ISIS' recruitment messaging and instead show them information that refutes it." [Wired] It's working, too: In two months of testing, over 300,000 people visited the anti-ISIS YouTube channels, and those who clicked on the campaigns spent even more time on the videos than people who casually browse YouTube. "These are people making decisions based on partial, bad information. We can affect the problem of foreign fighters joining the Islamic State by arming individuals with more and better information," said Yasmin Green, Jigsaw's head of research and development. The next step will be launching the program to target North American extremists, Wired reports, specifically targeting potential ISIS recruits as well as white supremacists.

Edit Scientists think there might be an underground ocean on Pluto 2:20 p.m. ET   Scientists studying a heart-shaped patch on Pluto's face say they've found evidence of water beneath the dwarf planet's surface. In two papers published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature, scientists revealed there may be a "cold, slushy" ocean about 62 miles deep, buried as far as 124 miles beneath Pluto's surface. The body of water could hold "as much water as all of Earth's seas," Reuters reported. Below Pluto's 'Heart' A Slushy Ocean May Churn | Video https://t.co/88Ww326emJ pic.twitter.com/ZKV3JpSKsD — SPACE.com (@SPACEdotcom) November 16, 2016 Evidence of Pluto's ocean was discovered as scientists puzzled over why the heart-shaped patch, identified as an "impact basin," was located so close to Pluto's equator and faced away from the planet's largest moon. Scientists deduced the planet likely flipped over after it was hit by a comet — but realized that flip could only have occurred if Pluto had a subsurface ocean that was affecting its weight distribution. When the comet hit, "'tens of kilometers of ice' was thrown from the basin," Wired reported, causing a planetary somersault. While liquid water is a key indicator of whether a planet could support life, scientists say the amount of ice almost certainly in Pluto's ocean makes life unlikely — but not "impossible." And, as Reuters noted, Pluto does still has enough radioactive heat to keep water in its liquid form.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 China's vice foreign minister Liu Zhenmin explained at United Nations talks in Marrakech, Morocco, that Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush had backed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in the 1980s, before China even knew of such negotiations to cut pollution, Bloomberg reports. Liu added that curbing emissions and using cleaner technologies and manufacturing techniques could actually boost U.S. production: "That's why I hope the Republican's administration will continue to support this process," he said. While the groundbreaking Paris Agreement now faces an uncertain future in light of the coming Trump presidency, Liu said China would continue to combat climate change "whatever the circumstances."

Trump has long promised to put an end to the proliferation of Chinese-manufactured products in the U.S., and to do so he has floated instating a tax as high as 45 percent on Chinese goods. "If [Trump] institutes a 35-percent penal tariff on every export from China, then most of what you buy at Walmart is 35 percent more expensive," Roger Entner of Recon Analytics explained. While some analysts say the tariff wouldn't necessarily trigger a parallel jump in prices, it would still make manufacturing iPhones significantly more expensive for Apple — and, in turn, for you to buy. A mere 15 percent tax could push iPhones up $50 in cost. That's not to mention the fact that China has warned of "countermeasures" if Trump tries to launch a trade war. But if Trump were to actually try to yank Apple's manufacturing from China altogether, it would spell an even bigger mess: To truly bring Apple's manufacturing back to the United States — meaning not just the final assembly of the phones and computers but the production of components by suppliers — would take tens of billions of dollars in new factory construction costs alone, Entner said. That doesn't consider the additional investments in education the United States would need to make to staff those factories [...] Considering the deficit in skilled U.S. workers, any plan to move Apple's manufacturing back to the United States probably would require hiring more foreign workers until enough Americans could be trained to take those jobs. All of this could be occurring against the backdrop of a trade-induced recession. As many as 4 million U.S. jobs would be lost as a result of Trump's trade war, and 3 million jobs would never be created, according to Moody's Analytics.

Yanez shot and killed Castile, an unarmed black man, in Falcon Heights on July 6, after stopping Castile and his girlfriend Diamond Reynolds for a broken tail light. He will face one count of second-degree manslaughter and two felony counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm. Ramsey County Attorney General John Choi said in a press conference Wednesday that Castile was not to blame for his own death. "No other police officer in a similar situation would have used deadly force," Choi said, as reported by Fox affiliate KSMP. Reynolds, who live-streamed the aftermath of Yanez's shooting of Castile on Facebook, said in the video that Castile had informed Yanez that he was carrying a firearm, for which he had a permit. Reynolds' live-stream caused news of Castile's death to go viral — especially because Castile's death came just one day after the fatal shooting by police of Alton Sterling, another unarmed black man, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on July 5.

In an interview Wednesday morning on CNN's New Day, Collins brushed off host Chris Cuomo's suggestion that maybe Trump's Twitter venting isn't a "healthy way for him to govern going forward." "Well, I can tell you this, the pressure that has got to be on President-elect Trump is immense," Collins replied. "The enormity of the job ahead of him, and so I would have to say if this is his way of relaxing, God bless him." "Relaxing?" Cuomo responded, apparently incredulous that tearing apart the media and calling every other thing "sad!" could classify as a way for the president-elect to achieve zen. "Absolutely," Collins said. "If this is what he has some fun with and he finds this relaxing, and his entertainment, let him go with it." Besides, Collins said, America wants to "continue to see a real human being in the White House." "It's Donald Trump being Donald Trump," Collins said. "You don't want this stuff all bottled up."

(AP) LG is unveiling the first phone to ship with Google’s new Android Nougat software, in hopes of appealing to people who like to take and share photos and video. The new V20 phone comes on the eve of a San Francisco event where Apple is expected to launch new iPhones. Nougat is already available as a free upgrade on some Google phones under the Nexus brand. The V20 would be the first with Nougat already installed. Other phones aren’t likely to get Nougat for a while because individual phone makers and wireless carriers have to tweak and test the new software first. Many of the Android improvements in Nougat are “under the hood” and thus largely invisible, such as tweaks to reduce battery consumption and cellular data use. The most obvious changes include the ability to run two apps side by side, something Samsung and LG have offered on their phones on a limited basis. Nougat will also let people reply to messages within notifications, something Apple already offers on iPhones. Meanwhile, the V20 promises higher-quality audio playback and recording, with reduced background noise, according to LG. The company also says it also improved image stabilization when recording video. LG spokesman Frank Lee described the V20’s target audience as “storytellers.” Like LG’s G5 phone, which it released in April, the V20 will have two lenses on the main camera — one for regular pictures and one with a wide angle to capture more of the scene. Unlike many other top-line phones, the V20 features a replaceable battery. The V20 is expected in South Korea this month, with other markets, including the U.S., to follow. LG didn’t immediately announce prices. Apple also plans to update its phone software this month. The update, iOS 10, will come with new messanging and photo features and more detailed notifications on the lock screen. Existing iPhone users will be encouraged to upgrade for the software for free. New iPhones expected to be unveiled Wednesday will come with iOS 10.

The issues are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion. Contents 1 Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) 1.1 WoSign Response 1.2 Further Comments 2 Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) 2.1 WoSign Response 3 Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) 3.1 WoSign Response 3.2 Further Comments 4 Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) 4.1 WoSign Response 4.2 Further Comments 5 Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) 5.1 WoSign Response 5.2 Further Comments 6 Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) 6.1 WoSign Response 6.1.1 Bug N1 6.1.2 Bug N2 6.2 Further Comments 7 Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) 7.1 WoSign Response 7.2 Further Comments 8 Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) 9 Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) 9.1 WoSign Response 10 Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) 10.1 WoSign Response 11 Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) 11.1 WoSign Response 11.2 Further Comments 12 Cross Signing Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. However, they have misclassified at least one - line 2 of Figure 14 - so the actual split may be different. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which may violate section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is unknown but probably at least 60. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, note that the above certs all have the same notAfter date, which is not exactly 1 year (or any other standard time period) after the notBefore. And the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) If we look for other certs matching this pattern, we find a total of 62 certificates in crt.sh and other sources. Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, the ID of certificates in WoSign's CT log can be used to show the logging sequence of a set of certificates even if they don't have embedded SCTs, because the IDs are sequential. If you order all certs in WoSign's log by ID, up to ID 109149, where the notBefore is on December 31st, the notBefore values are (approximately) chronologically ordered. Those which have embedded SCTs have timestamps which are about 2 hours later than the notBefore date. But after that follow 64 certificates which are all dated on December 20, 2015 (CST, UTC+8). This suggests that these were logged at the actual time of issuance but that time is not reflected in their notBefore date - i.e. they were backdated. And it further suggests that this behaviour only began after December 31st 2015, i.e. it was not a continuation of some previous behaviour. Thirdly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated) but where the SCT date is nevertheless before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating does not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Google Updates Schema Guidelines for Local Business Reviews Local Search  SEO August 29, 2016 Local Search SEO Matt SouthernAugust 29, 2016 SEJ STAFF 697SHARES 2.5KREADS 697SHARES 2.5KREADS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 697SHARES 2.5KREADS Google has made a number of notable updates to its Schema guidelines with respect to how local businesses can markup the reviews they receive. In addition to adding new rules that were not previously in place, Google has also disallowed a few practices that were once considered perfectly acceptable. For example, businesses used to be able to add markup to reviews received from third-party sites, but that is now no longer the case. To clarify, it’s OK to include third-party reviews on your website, as long as they are not marked up with Schema. From now on, Google wants to see Schema markup only on reviews “that have been directly produced by your site.” If the exact same review has been syndicated elsewhere, marking it up with Schema will now be a violation of Google’s guidelines. If you use, or are planning to use Schema markup on reviews published on your website, it’s fairly important to review the new guidelines to ensure they are still being followed. Here they are verbatim: Snippets must not be written or provided by the business or content provider unless they are genuine, independent, and unpaid editorial reviews. Reviews must allow for customers to express both positive and negative sentiments. They may not be vetted by the business or restricted by the content provider based on the positive/negative sentiment of the review before submission to Google. Reviews cannot be template sentences built from data or automated metrics. For example, the following is not acceptable: “Based on X number of responses, on average people experienced X with this business.” Reviews for multiple-location businesses such as retail chains or franchises can only be submitted for the specific business location for which they were written. In other words, reviews for multiple-location businesses cannot be syndicated or applied to all business locations of the same company. Aggregators or content providers must have no commercial agreements paid or otherwise with businesses to provide reviews. Do not include reviews that are duplicate or similar reviews across many businesses or from different sources. Only include reviews that have been directly produced by your site, not reviews from third- party sites or syndicated reviews.

Good job done Google. Dre Are you being sarcastic? lol Vistasadmedia thanks for the update Matt , this will make an end to fake reviews. Guess This is really going to effect in local rankings Dre Please advise how you came to this conclusion? To me the opposite seems true because now website owners can markup their own customer reviews that are potentially fake (the owner can say they are real all he wants and post only 4-5 star reviews, excluding any 1 star reviews) So can someone explain this logic to me, because I am confused… Thanks Dre Thank you for sharing this, however I am still confused how this Google update limits fake reviews? From what I understand Google trusts website owners to post their customers legitimate reviews on their site and mark them up with schema without needing to provide any proof… So Charles Lewis below has a great point “is this approval to use Schema and markup on all those testimonial emails my clients got?” Can you please elaborate on this, because from my understanding this is exactly what Google is allowing. Thanks semalaia4n nice information of the google updates. the customer knows what to expect.

A mishit by Nishikori makes it 0-15, and after a long rally, Nishikori gets impatient and commits another unforced error. He redeems himself with a powerful forehand winner after a smart serve...15-30. Nishikori goes again with his forehand and again, Murray can’t deal with it. 30-30. Nishikori is absolutely going all over the court to save anything Murray throws at him, but this last one, a strong forehand, is too much.

He keeps shouting to his camp, he knows that he’s running out of time, the frustration shows again as he commits another unforced error: 30-30.

Nishikori takes one back as Murray’s backhand return is too long...and something really strange just happened: the sound system in the stadium made some weird piano-like noise and the umpire calls for the point to be replayed. Murray is furious! Murray complains to the umpire saying that they should have kept playing after the sound malfunction and his temporary lack of focus causes him for it to be advantage to Nishikori.

An unforced error by Murray makes it 0-30. This is weird by Murray as he looks a little flat-footed and out of sorts. A great drop shot proves me wrong and it’s 15-30. The best rally of the match ends with a Nishikori unforced error. It begins with a drop shot which Murray returns, followed by a lob, which Murray returns...and Murray takes it. But Nishikori wins the next one and it’s break point. Murray ties it up with 40-40, Nishikori challenges and succeeds...wow. It was just out and it’s second serve.

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint New York: Weeks after leaving her eponymous news website to launch a corporate wellness service called Thrive, Arianna Huffington has hired former New York Times and Google executives for the new venture, aiming to teach companies to “treat the whole human being.” As it enters the crowded workplace wellness industry, with its quit-smoking incentives and step challenges, Thrive intends to go beyond the usual offerings to focus on “the mental aspects of our lives, what’s happening in our heads,” Huffington said in an interview. “This is all something that you bring to work,” she added. Huffington spent more than a decade running the Huffington Post, which she founded in 2005, but over the years her interest shifted from news to the pursuit of elusive work-life balance. In the last two years, she has published two books—Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder and the nap-at-work manifesto The Sleep Revolution—full of theories she’s now spinning into her new business. Last month, she announced she was leaving her namesake site to pursue her latest venture. Thrive will officially launch 30 November, Huffington said. In the meantime, the company is staffing up: Rajiv Pant, a former chief technology officer (CTO) at the New York Times, has come on as CTO, and Kathryn Friedrich, who spent the better part of a decade at Google and YouTube, will join next month as chief marketing officer. Both said Huffington’s plea for a more humane work-life balance drew them to the organization. “I was truly stressed out. This is something I personally connected with,” said Pant. “If you look at my tweets, they’re about behavior, getting enough sleep. This is the right company.” Friedrich thinks Thrive can create a more positive work-life experience than even Google, considered an Eden of workplace culture. “Google tries to create a good existence for their employees. They do a fantastic job,” she said. “The one thing that might be missing that Arianna wants to bring to the table are metrics. It’s one thing to put all the offerings out there. It’s another thing to measure the success of those things.” (Google is known for studying its company culture’s effects on employees’ productivity and happiness.) At its core, Thrive is a corporate wellness consultancy: Companies pay Thrive-trained coaches to bestow health and wellness tips on their overworked and underperforming staffs. They can opt for online courses or in-person trainings, with sessions ranging from a couple of hours to six weeks. Huffington said that the consulting firm Accenture has already piloted trainings and that JPMorgan Chase has also signed on for a partnership. Also read: What not to do on your office PC In addition to its courses, Thrive will also have a media arm, as Bloomberg reported in June. Huffington has previously said Thrive is not a media company but said in an interview that it will have “a consumer platform attached to the corporate platform that will be constantly reinforcing our message.” Much like the Huffington Post, the site will rely on big names, like athletes and experts, for its content. It will also sell wellness-related products like pillows and food supplements, and Huffington hopes it will eventually become a discussion platform open to the public—something the company is working on with Medium, she said. The sell? All of this, in theory, services Thrive’s clients’ bottom lines. But with its entry into the corporate wellness industry, which market research firm IBISWorld values at $6 billion, Thrive is competing within an already crowded space. And Huffington—who champions digital detoxing, office napping and actually unplugging on vacation—is not alone in pushing mindfulness on companies. Many other wellness companies address both body and mind, too, offering office fitness alongside meditation. (Here’s just one example.) Corporate wellness budgets have ballooned as companies try to curb health insurance costs, since a healthier workforce means lower insurance costs and higher productivity. But a much-cited RAND Corporation study has called many such wellness offerings into question, finding that for all the money poured into them, they save little on health care: For every $1 spent on “lifestyle management” programs—like smoking cessation and weight-loss initiatives—companies saved just 50 cents, the study found. Huffington is confident Thrive’s holistic approach will yield better results for both clients and workers, saying the Rand study “really didn’t address things like stress and burnout.” Thrive, she said, will rely only on “evidence-based” methods for its courses; it has hired Adam Grant, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, to study its work with Accenture. “As we get more evidence, we will be adopting and adjusting everything we are doing,” said Huffington. Maybe napping at the office only works during certain times of day? Or maybe meetings are actually better when everyone has a cell phone? For now, in its own SoHo offices, Thrive plans to practice what it preaches. Meetings will be device-free. (”We have beautiful notebooks,” said Huffington.) And, yes, there will be a place to nap.

And what a snaffle by a kid in the crowd, who absolutely adores his moment! Great stuff. Shahid Afridi (@SAfridiOfficial) Brilliant batting Khalid&Sharjeel. This is Pakistan style, we need this aggressive approach in all T20s & ODI matches. Joy to watch!

Updated at 3.58pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.55pm EDT 15:55 9th over: Pakistan 98-0 (Sharjeel 57, Latif 35) Target 136 On comes Moeen, lucky him. And I wonder if England copied the wrong aspects of Pakistan’s bowling, or at least if they should’ve had a spinner on early. Five from the over, for all the difference that makes. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.52pm EDT 15:52 8th over: Pakistan 93-0 (Sharjeel 54, Latif 33) Target 136 Sharjeel calls for a new bat as Rashid warms up, while Ward and Wasim wonder if it’ll be a heavier one to help get the spin away. Well, whatever it is, it’s working, because Rashid’s second ball, dragged down, is carted over that long leg side boundary that caused England so much aggravation. And there’a another! A full one, right in the slot, and it goes with the spin to square-leg! What a 50 that is, off 30 balls! Sharjeel brings up his 50.

Stokes is still going, and with the fielders back can keep his lengths back. This is a much tighter over, but then it still yields three which is only just below the rate. Updated at 3.47pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.42pm EDT 15:42 6th over: Pakistan 74-0 (Sharjeel 37, Latif 32) Target 136 Morgan chucks Root the ball - I’m surprised he’s waited this long to take some pace off, given the havoc already wrought, for all the difference it makes. The batsmen take a single each, then Latif canes one wide of long-on for four, then Latif sweeps one to square-leg for four! The required rate is now 4.42, thanks principally to 14 4s and a 6. Again, this is over! Sharjeel Khan in action.

Two singles come from his first three balls, and then a thick edge from Sharjeel narrowly avoids the stumps ... and goes for four! This over already! And oh what a shot comes next! A delicious square-cut for four, and what’s notable about it - so too the one he played off Plunkett - is how little room he needs to force it away exceedingly hard. And there he goes again! Six, absolutely mass-murdered over cow corner! Stokes’ first over since he was Brathwaited has gone for 16! Updated at 3.40pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.33pm EDT 15:33 4th over: Pakistan 47-0 (Sharjeel 21, Latif 21) Target 136 You’ve got to laugh! Hahahahahahaha! Plunkett comes into the attack, starts with a short one because he’s a bit quicker than the other two, and Sharjeel goes for another pull, gets another top edge, gets four more runs! But jeers follow, as the batsmen are uncouth enough to amble a single, soon replaced by cheers when Plunkett hammers down a leg side wide that Buttler can’t feel and four more add to the total. And four more, from a really good shot - Plunkett gives Sharjeel a little width, but he turns it into a lot of width, slamming four through the covers. This is brilliant batting, abject though the bowling has been. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.28pm EDT 15:28 3rd over: Pakistan 32-0 (Sharjeel 16, Latif 16) Target 136 Again, Willey starts ok, but then a half-tracker gets Sharjeel warm and he absolutely dematerialises it over midwicket. There’s something of Sehwag about him, in the way that he doesn’t bother with niceties of foot movement, just trusts his eyes and his wrists. And the crows, already at a peak, go off again when a floaty one is creamed through midwicket. That’s eight boundaries; who can be arsed running in this unseasonable warmth? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.24pm EDT 15:24 2nd over: Pakistan 24-0 (Sharjeel 8, Latif 16) Target 136 Jordan starts with a bouncer and Latif goes with it, swinging over backward square-leg for four. And oh dear, another short one, only this time it’s wide too, so Latif crashes it through point. Then a dot, then a slower ball, and Pakistan know they’ve shown England what to do, so are waiting for them to do it - this shorter one goes to the midwicket fence! And another wide one allows Latif to humding through point, just standing there as it arrives and just standing there as it hurtles to the fence. 16 off the over, four 4s to Latif, what a start for Pakistan! Updated at 3.25pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.19pm EDT 15:19 1st over: Pakistan 8-0 (Sharjeel 8, Latif 0) Target 136 Swing for Willey, who starts well, with four dots, but then Sharjeel goes to pull one off length, sat back in his crease, and top edges over his head for a one bounce four. And next ball, he waits again, slapping high to the point fence for four, and now it’s Pakistan who’ve started well.

Photograph: Paul Greenwood/BPI/REX/Shutterstock Updated at 3.35pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.08pm EDT 15:08 So, worse to bat first and lose wickets chasing a bigger total than is realistic, or worse to field first and spend five overs sussing out the best way to bowl on the particular track? Well, Pakistan are strong favourites, but if England’s spinners bowl well, they’re in the game. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.06pm EDT 15:06 PAKISTAN NEED 136 TO BEAT ENGLAND 20th over: England 135-7 (Ali 13, Plunkett 0) Moeen chucks the bat and carves two to deep cover. The ball plugs away from the fielders, and chasing, Babar slips on the dewey grass and has to be schlepped off by his mates with a twisted ankle. Wahab then hurls down a quicker one, it’s a dot, and a yorker to finish cedes just a single. Brilliantly bowled, Pakistan. Shoaib carries his teammate Babar off the pitch.

Willey c Shoaib Malik b Wahab Riaz 12 (England 132-7) Willey goes after another short one, doesn’t catch it, and Shoaib pouches it at mid-off. Tim Robinson thinks he’s detected a no ball, but checks and he has not. Malik jumps to catch Willey for 12. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 3.11pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.02pm EDT 15:02 20th over: England 132-6 (Ali 10, Willey 12) Pakistan have all their men on the leg side out and all their men on the off side in. Wahab opens with a dot, but then Willey finagles two into the leg side - Sarfraz has to chase, due to the aforementioned field placings. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.00pm EDT 15:00 19th over: England 130-6 (Ali 10, Willey 10) This has been a wonderful display of guile, variation and bottle from Pakistan. England are more or less looking for ones and twos now, and that’s all Amir is permitting them. He even clatters Moeen in the sternum with a slower one that’s not picked - another slower one that’s not picked - and the over yields just six. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.56pm EDT 14:56 18th over: England 124-6 (Ali 9, Willey 7) Sohail Tanvir returns, and the batsmen take a single each before Willey waits to clout a cutter over cow corner. That was the kind of delivery that was getting sent earlier in the innings, not into the pitch so sitting up and waiting for treatment. But it’s the only boundary ceded, Sohail’s highlight a beautifully disguised slower ball out the back of the hand. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.52pm EDT 14:52 17th over: England 116-6 (Ali 7, Willey 1) Mohammad Amir returns and after a single and a leg-bye, a bit of late movement through the air deceives Willey, ball clunking pad. There’s an appeal, but it looked like it was going just down - Hawkeye says it was feathering leg stump. England haven’t managed a boundary in the second half of their innings, and don’t especially look like changing that. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.48pm EDT 14:48 16th over: England 110-6 (Ali 3, Willey 0) England are 17-3 from the last three overs. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.47pm EDT 14:47 Morgan c Sarfraz b Wahab 14 (England 110-6) And it’s an even better one now! Morgan looks to glide one down to third man, gets a toe to it, and Wahab is off without even looking at the umpire. There is very little better than watching him when it’s all going on. Wahab celebrates as Morgan walks. Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters Updated at 2.56pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.45pm EDT 14:45 16th over: England 110-5 (Morgan 14, Ali 3) Wahab is charging in now - his first delivery is almost 92mph. With Pakistan bowling back of a length to force England’s batsmen square of the wicket, where the boundaries are long, might they stand further out of their crease? Anyway, after a leg-bye, Moeen gets two in the covers, then a single, and a wide follows; this is still a decent over. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.42pm EDT 14:42 15th over: England 105-5 (Morgan 14, Ali o) Morgan wallops one into the air and towards the leg side - but it drops safe.

Stokes c Babar Azam b Hasan Ali 4 (England 104-5) Stokes goes for this, taking it from outside off towards square-leg. And he properly connects too, but the boundary’s a biggun and off he pops! Updated at 2.41pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.39pm EDT 14:39 15th over: England 104-4 (Morgan 13, Stokes 4) Oh goody gumdrops, our commentators impart more tales of cricketers on the golf course; verily there is no thrill like it. Anyway, Hasan Ali is rustling through another fine over... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.37pm EDT 14:37 14th over: England 100-4 (Morgan 12, Stokes 1) “There’s a bit of hold in the pitch,” says Alex Hales in commentary, and he reckons 160 or so is a decent score. He also says Imad isn’t looking to spin the ball much, just bowls it straight, which is why you shouldn’t play across the line to him as Hales did. He’s not, apparently, as tricky as Herath, and Rashid and Moeen, who “put more revs on the ball”, should go well on this track. Another quietish over. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.32pm EDT 14:32 WICKET! Buttler c Shoaib Malik b Wahab Riaz 16 (England 93-4) And there you go! Buttler forces it, making room and swishing - he gets plenty of it, but picks out the fielder at deep point. Apparently, he hit it too well, but on the other hand, Pakistan are rolling! Riaz celebrates as Buttler is caught. Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images Updated at 2.50pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.30pm EDT 14:30 13th over: England 93-3 (Buttler 16, Morgan 10) Hasan Ali comes back, having changed ends, and continues those awkward variations of pace - his first four deliveries are 84, 85, 70, 74, brilliant! Buttler tries a scoop at the fifth, misses, and he’s losing the battle at the moment. “Why have just a single 20-over match,” emails Smylers, “on each against each of England’s visitors this summer, after five 50-over ones — rather than, say, three of each? Wouldn’t it be easier for England to improve at 20:20 cricket if they played a few more matches?” I don’t know the answer to this one for sure, but I can hazard a guess and it starts with “money” and ends with “money”. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.26pm EDT 14:26 12th over: England 89-3 (Buttler 14, Morgan 8) Into the attack comes Wahab, who sets himself a field that says short stuff. And Buttler can’t get at him after a Morgan single gets him strike, missing two before taking one. Morgan then runs two down to third man and follows in with another single, and England have only taken 36 off the last six overs; well bowled Pakistan. Updated at 2.27pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.22pm EDT 14:22 11th over: England 84-3 (Buttler 13, Morgan 4) Sarfraz is bowling out Imad, trying to break this partnership, so England bunt him around. He reminds me a little of Kumble in his straightness, but once he’s finished Pakistan only have Shoaib bowling spin - I wonder if they regret leaving out Nawaz. It’s true that the track at OT has some bounce, but only really helps the quickest. Seven off the over, and Imad finishes with 2-17 - what an effort that is. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.18pm EDT 14:18 10th over: England 78-3 (Buttler 9, Morgan 1) England now have two batsmen yet to face a ball, but it doesn’t mither Buttler, who strides down the track and gently leans on one just like that - it’s perfectly timed, and gets him four through cover. And oh my days! I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a batsman quite like Buttler! He gets on his toes to chuck torso, forearms, wrists, hands and fingers through a short one, which gets him another 4. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.14pm EDT 14:14 WICKET! Root c Shoaib Malik b Hasan Ali 6 (England 67-3) Root leaps to uppercut but there just isn’t enough pace on the ball, given that he’s mid-air when he connects. He gets most of it, but even so, the ball lobs to third man. Hassan is congratulatedas Root walks.

Lol — Jonas B (@jonasblasas) September 7, 2016 Yelp is guaranteeing at least $100 for every bug found, but only critical flaws would earn anything close to the $15,000 maximum. Still, in the first 24 hours, two white-hat hackers have earned $100 apiece, showing the immediate power of a bug bounty program. Anyone interested in earning a fast buck should check out the webpage on which Yelp spells out its bug bounty program policy. The most interesting part, titled Please Be Nice To Us, asks hackers to “bring out your big guns, but hold off on actually breaking anything. Please avoid DDoS’ing us or breaking our systems and services while you are testing.” Instagram Kills Photo Map Instagram is in the process of killing Photo Map. This feature enabled you to see a map showing the locations users had tagged their photos in. But Instagram has already removed the Photo Map from some users, with everyone set to follow suit in the near future. Urg @instagram, I love the photo map feature!

Then, a series of weird accidents turned server logs into the signature motif of the 21st century, a kind of eternal, ubiquitous exhaust from our daily lives, the CO2 of the Internet: invisible, seemingly innocuous, but harmful enough, in aggregate, to destroy our world. Here’s how that happened: first, there were cookies. People running web-servers wanted a way to interact with the people who were using them: a way, for example, to remember your preferences from visit to visit, or to identify you through several screens’ worth of interactions as you filled and cashed out a virtual shopping cart. Then, Google and a few other companies came up with a business model. When Google started, no one could figure out how the com­pany would ever repay its investors, especially as the upstart search-engine turned up its nose at the dirtiest practices of the industry, such as plastering its homepage with banner ads or, worst of all, selling the top results for common search terms. Instead, Google and the other early ad-tech companies worked out that they could place ads on other people’s websites, and that those ads could act as a two-way conduit between web users and Google. Every page with a Google ad was able to both set and read a Google cookie with your browser (you could turn this off, but no one did), so that Google could get a pretty good picture of which websites you visited. That information, in turn, could be used to target you for ads, and the sites that placed Google ads on their pages would get a little money for each visitor. Advertisers could target different kinds of users – users who had searched for information about asbestos and lung cancer, about baby products, about wedding planning, about science fiction novels. The websites themselves became part of Google’s ‘‘inventory’’ where it could place the ads, but they also improved Google’s dossiers on web users and gave it a better story to sell to advertisers. The idea caught the zeitgeist, and soon everyone was trying to figure out how to gather, aggregate, analyze, and resell data about us as we moved around the web. Of course, there were privacy implications to all this. As early breaches and tentative litigation spread around the world, lawyers for Google and for the major publishers (and for publishing tools, the blogging tools that eventually became the ubiquitous ‘‘Content Management Systems’’ that have become the default way to publish material online) adopted boiler­plate legalese, those ‘‘privacy policies’’ and ‘‘terms of service’’ and ‘‘end user license agreements’’ that are referenced at the bottom of so many of the pages you see every day, as in, ‘‘By using this website, you agree to abide by its terms of service.’’ As more and more companies twigged to the power of ‘‘surveillance capitalism,’’ these agreements proliferated, as did the need for them, because before long, everything was gathering data. As the Internet everted into the physical world and colonized our phones, we started to get a taste of what this would look like in the coming years. Apps that did innocuous things like turning your phone into a flashlight, or recording voice memos, or letting your kids join the dots on public domain clip-art, would come with ‘‘permissions’’ screens that required you to let them raid your phone for all the salient facts of your life: your phone number, e-mail address, SMSes and other messages, e-mail, location – everything that could be sensed or inferred about you by a device that you carried at all times and made privy to all your most sensitive moments. When a backlash began, the app vendors and smartphone companies had a rebuttal ready: ‘‘You agreed to let us do this. We gave you notice of our privacy practices, and you consented.’’ This ‘‘notice and consent’’ model is absurd on its face, and yet it is surprisingly legally robust. As I write this in July of 2016, US federal appellate courts have just ruled on two cases that asked whether End User Licenses that no one read and no one understands and no one takes seriously are enforceable. The cases differed a little in their answer, but in both cases, the judges said that they were enforceable at least some of the time (and that violating them can be a felony!). These rulings come down as the entirety of America has been consumed with Pokémon Go fever, only to have a few killjoys like me point out that merely by installing the game, all those millions of players have ‘‘agreed’’ to forfeit their right to sue any of Pokémon’s corporate masters should the com­panies breach all that private player data. You do, however, have 30 days to opt out of this forfeiture; if Pokémon Go still exists in your timeline and you signed up for it in the past 30 days, send an e-mail to with the subject ‘‘Arbitra­tion Opt-out Notice’’ and include in the body ‘‘a clear declaration that you are opting out of the arbitration clause in the Pokémon Go terms of service.’’ Notice and consent is an absurd legal fiction. Jonathan A. Obar and Anne Oeldorf-Hirsch, a pair of communications professors from York University and the University of Connecticut, published a working paper in 2016 called ‘‘The Biggest Lie on the Internet: Ignoring the Privacy Policies and Terms of Service Policies of Social Net­working Services.’’ The paper details how the profs gave their students, who are studying license agreements and privacy, a chance to beta-test a new social network (this service was fictitious, but the students didn’t know that). To test the network, the students had to create accounts, and were given a chance to review the service’s terms of service and privacy policy, which prominently promised to give all the users’ personal data to the NSA, and demanded the students’ first-born children in return for access to the service. As you may have gathered from the paper’s title, none of the students noticed either fact, and almost none of them even glanced at the terms of service for more than a few seconds. Indeed, you can’t examine the terms of service you interact with in any depth – it would take more than 24 hours a day just to figure out what rights you’ve given away that day. But as terrible as notice-and-consent is, at least it pretends that people should have some say in the destiny of the data that evanescences off of their lives as they move through time, space, and information. The next generation of networked devices are literally incapable of participating in that fiction. The coming Internet of Things – a terrible name that tells you that its proponents don’t yet know what it’s for, like ‘‘mobile phone’’ or ‘’3D printer’’ – will put networking capability in everything: appliances, light­bulbs, TVs, cars, medical implants, shoes, and garments. Your lightbulb doesn’t need to be able to run apps or route packets, but the tiny, com­modity controllers that allow smart lightswitches to control the lights anywhere (and thus allow devices like smart thermostats and phones to integrate with your lights and home security systems) will come with full-fledged computing capability by default, because that will be more cost-efficient that customizing a chip and system for every class of devices. The thing that has driven computers so relentlessly, making them cheaper, more powerful, and more ubiquitous, is their flexibility, their character of general-purposeness. That fact of general-purposeness is inescapable and wonderful and terrible, and it means that the R&D that’s put into making computers faster for aviation benefits the computers in your phone and your heart-monitor (and vice-versa). So every­thing’s going to have a computer. You will ‘‘interact’’ with hundreds, then thou­sands, then tens of thousands of computers every day. The vast majority of these interactions will be glancing, momentary, and with computers that have no way of displaying terms of service, much less presenting you with a button to click to give your ‘‘consent’’ to them. Every TV in the sportsbar where you go for a drink will have cameras and mics and will capture your image and process it through facial-recognition software and capture your speech and pass it back to a server for continu­ous speech recognition (to check whether you’re giving it a voice command). Every car that drives past you will have cameras that record your like­ness and gait, that harvest the unique identifiers of your Bluetooth and other short-range radio devices, and send them to the cloud, where they’ll be merged and aggregated with other data from other sources. In theory, if notice-and-consent was anything more than a polite fiction, none of this would hap­pen. If notice-and-consent are necessary to make data-collection legal, then without notice-and-consent, the collection is illegal. But that’s not the realpolitik of this stuff: the reality is that when every car has more sensors than a Google Streetview car, when every TV comes with a camera to let you control it with gestures, when every medical implant collects telemetry that is collected by a ‘‘services’’ business and sold to insurers and pharma companies, the argument will go, ‘‘All this stuff is both good and necessary – you can’t hold back progress!’’ It’s true that we can’t have self-driving cars that don’t look hard at their surroundings all the time, and pay especially close attention to humans to make sure that they’re not killing them. However, there’s nothing intrinsic to self-driving cars that says that the data they gather needs to be retained or further processed. Remember that for many years, the server logs that recorded all your inter­actions with the web were flushed as a matter of course, because no one could figure out what they were good for, apart from debugging problems when they occurred. The returns from data-acquisition have been de­clining for years. In the early years of data-driven advertising, advertisers took it on faith that better targeting justified much higher ad-rates. Over time, some of that optimism has worn off, helped along by the fact that we have become adapted to advertising, so that targeting no longer works as well as it did in the early days. Recall that soap companies once advertised by proclaiming, ‘‘You will be cleaner, 5 cents,’’ and seem to have sold a hell of a lot of soap that way. Over time, people became inured to those messages, entering into an arms race with advertisers that takes us all the way up to those Axe Body Spray ads where the right personal hygiene products will summon literal angels to the side of an unremarkable man and, despite their wings, these angels all exude decid­edly unangelic lust for our lad. The ads are always the most interesting part of old magazines, because they suggest a time when people were much more naive about the messages they believed. But diminishing returns can be masked by more aggressive collection. If Facebook can’t figure out how to justify its ad ratecard based on the data it knows about you, it can just plot ways to find out a lot more about you and buoy up that price. The next iteration of this is the gadgets that will spy on us from every angle, in every way, all the time. The data that these services collect will be even more toxic in its potential to harm us. Consider that today, identity thieves merge data from several breaches in order to piece together enough information to get a duplicate deed for their victims’ houses and sell those houses out from under them; that voyeurs use untargeted attacks to seize control over peoples’ laptops to capture nude photos of them and then use those to blackmail their victims to perform live sex-acts on camera; that every person who ever applied for security clearance in the USA had their data stolen by Chinese spies, who broke into the Office of Personnel Management’s servers and stole more than 20,000,000 records. The best way to secure data is never to collect it in the first place. Data that is collected is likely to leak. Data that is collected and retained is certain to leak. A house that can be controlled by voice and gesture is a house with a camera and a microphone covering every inch of its floorplan. The IoT will rupture notice-and-consent, but without some other legal framework to replace it, it’ll be a free-for-all that ends in catastrophe. I’m frankly very scared of this outcome and have a hard time imagining many ways in which we can avert it, but I do have one scenario that’s plausible: class action lawsuits. Right now, companies that breach their users’ data face virtually no liability. When Home Depot lost 53 million credit-card numbers and 56 million associated e-mail addresses, a court awarded its customers $0.34 each, along with gift certificates for credit monitoring services, whose efficacy is not borne out in the literature. But the breaches will keep on coming, and they will get worse, and entrepreneurial class-action lawyers will be spoiled for choice when it comes to clients. These no-win/no-fee lawyers represent a kind of sustained, hill-climbing iterative attack on surveillance capital­ism, trying randomly varied approaches to get courts to force the corporations they sue to absorb the full social cost of their reckless data-collection and handling. Eventually, some lawyer is going to convince a judge that, say, 1% the victims of a deep-pocketed company’s breach will end up losing their houses to identity thieves as a result of the data that the company has leaked, and that the damages should be equal to 1% of all the property owned by a 53 million (or 500 million!) customers whom the company has wronged. It will take down a Fortune 100 company, and transfer billions from investors and insurers to lawyers and their clients. When that day comes, there’ll be blood in the boardroom. Every major investor will want to know that the company is insured for a potential award of 500X the company’s net worth. Every re-insurer and underwriter will want to know exactly what data-collection practices they’re insuring. (Indeed, even a good scare will likely bring both circumstances to reality, even if the decision is successfully appealed). The danger, of course, is the terms of service. If every ‘‘agreement’’ you click past or flee from includes forced arbitration – that is, a surrender of your right to sue or join a class action – then there’s no class to join the class action. There’s a reason arbitration agreements have proliferated to every corner of our lives, from Airbnb and Google Fiber to several doctors and dentists whose waiting-rooms I’ve walked out of since moving back the USA last year. I even had to agree to forced arbi­tration to drop my daughter off at a kids’ birthday party (I’m not making this up – it was in a pizza parlor with a jungle gym). It’s a coming storm of the century, and our umbrellas are all those water-soluble $5 numbers that materialize on New York street corners every time clouds appear in the sky. Be afraid.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Ethan Baron. Updated September 7, 2016 8:26AM SHARE ALSO SEE Google Oracle Government Silicon Valley Transparency Eric Schmidt Google's enemies are legion. [The company] has fought bitter court battles against Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and PayPal. It has faced a well-financed campaign by Oracle, TripAdvisor, Expedia, Nokia and others against its European operations, plus a similar action driven by Yelp. It's been targeted in a lawsuit by AT&T over access to utility poles for Google Fiber. Now, in what appears to be a new tactic on the technology industry battleground, Google has come under attack by a mysterious group that keeps mum about its sponsors while issuing scathing reports about the Mountain View search giant's influence on government. Among its recent revelations: High-ranking Google execs have had more than 20 "intimate" meetings with President Barack Obama, and the company has a revolving-door employment relationship with the federal government. While the backers of the "Google Transparency Project" may be hidden, its purpose is clear, observers say: To offer purportedly objective research and commentary that can be used to thwart Google's burgeoning power in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, much as similar "think tanks" have sought to undermine the environmental lobby or promote development projects. "When you're successful, you're on top of the hill. You become a target," said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management who studies the technology industry. Google, with a market capitalization of $529 billion, is a Goliath among Bay Area tech giants. It is known for disrupting industries around the world, from travel to media to transportation, making it enemy No. 1 for many competitors and leaving a trail of lawsuits in its wake. Oracle is still fighting to renew a failed $9 billion lawsuit accusing Google of stealing Oracle code to cash in on the Android mobile operating system. Google and the Transparency Project both declined to comment. So far, only Redwood Shores-based Oracle has admitted to funding the Transparency Project, telling Fortune it wanted the public to know about its support for the initiative. Oracle declined to comment to this newspaper. Other companies that have tangled with Google have denied involvement with the project, including AT&T, Yelp and Microsoft. "This is an attempt to influence policy, essentially, to restrict the behavior of your competitor who you feel is either monopolistic or competing unfairly," Cusumano said. American companies have long assailed competitors by sponsoring damaging research, but the Transparency Project's approach -- highly public attacks combined with profound secrecy about its backers -- is a new tactic in Silicon Valley tech, said Steve Blank, a lecturer at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and prominent Silicon Valley observer. "This is just a symptom of a much bigger game. What you want to do if you're a corporation is you want to influence policy for your interest," Blank said. "We're just like any other industry now. This is what this game has gotten down to in Silicon Valley because the stakes are big enough." Just as there's nothing illegal about the activities that have put Google in the cross hairs of the Transparency Project -- lobbying, sponsoring research, and building close ties with U.S. officials -- the project's secrecy-shrouded attack-dog work also appears not to cross any legal lines. "I don't see any of this as nefarious," said former U.S. Department of Justice chief economist Daniel Rubinfeld, an emeritus professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. "It's changing times. Companies are battling each other on many more fronts than they used to." The Transparency Project commenced hostilities against Google in April, gaining national media attention with a report tracking the number of Googlers taking jobs in the White House and federal agencies, and the number of federal officials traveling in the other direction, into Google. Project researchers reported 113 "revolving door" moves between Google -- plus its associated companies, law firms and lobbyists -- and the White House and federal agencies. "Over the past decade, Google has transformed itself from the dominant internet search engine into a global business empire that touches on almost every facet of people's lives -- often without their knowledge or consent," the group's first report said. "It scans the content of people's emails, tracks their activities online and their movements in the real world. It analyzes their search queries and behavior in ways many find troubling. At the same time, the company has assiduously courted Washington." Another report, based on White House guest logs, cites 427 visits by employees of Google and "associated entities" to the White House since January 2009, with 21 "small, intimate" meetings between senior Google executives and Obama. "Google executives have had extraordinary access to the White House meetings at which policies are set ... meetings encompassing a surprisingly wide range of topics including intellectual property, national security, government contracts, digital media strategy, antitrust, biotechnology, energy and climate change, broadband and telecommunications, foreign policy, health care, aerospace and aeronautics," the report said. Another missive from the organization suggested that Google was influencing government policymakers on the sly by funding researchers who kept quiet about their ties to the company while promoting policies favorable to Google. "Google-funded academics are playing an outsize role in the debate over the U.S. government's policy on internet privacy, a rapidly evolving area and an existential issue for Google," the report said. "They are also often at the epicenter of policy research on antitrust issues in the age of digital platforms, another issue in which Google has a major stake." Google declined to comment on the project's critiques. But none of the corporate behaviors described in the critical reports surprised UC Berkeley's Blank. "Businesses will spend what's necessary to influence policy," Blank said. "It raises the larger issue of whether any industry people should have that level of influence. We've built what I call a deep-pockets democracy. If you have deep pockets you have more access (to government officials) than a nonprofit or somebody who's trying to represent Americans. "What's not being represented by either Oracle or Google is the public interest." However, Google's competitors stand to gain from the Transparency Project's spotlight on the firm's aggressive efforts to mold policy, Cusumano of MIT said. Government officials might be less likely to make or promote policies benefiting Google if they felt the company's influence was being monitored, Cusumano said. "They might re-evaluate what they're doing or thinking of doing," Cusumano said. For a group devoted to "transparency," the Google project's origins are obscure. It is run by the nonprofit Campaign for Accountability, a group that says it is dedicated to exposing government and corporate malfeasance and which started as an offshoot of the deep-pocketed New Venture Fund. The New Venture Fund is heavily supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. A Gates Foundation spokeswoman did not provide an answer when asked whether the foundation was aware of the venture fund's work on the Google Transparency Project. The Hewlett Foundation said none of its donations went to the project. The Campaign for Accountability does not publicly reveal its connection to the venture fund -- in fact its deputy director claimed to this newspaper in July that it was not a project of NVF, despite this newspaper having donated $1 to the campaign and received a tax receipt from the fund in return. However, the fund's president later admitted it did run the Campaign, but said it was spinning it off into a new organization called Hopewell Fund. Among Hopewell's three directors is Michael Slaby, who appears to be the same man who was an election-campaign-technology guru behind Obama's two successful runs, and whose campaign-tech platform The Groundwork is being used by the Hillary Clinton campaign. In a bizarre and quite possibly coincidental twist, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is reportedly the main investor in The Groundwork, raising the puzzling specter of the influential and respected Googler funding the work of a man whose side project is attacking Google. Google declined to provide access to Schmidt, who is now executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet, and Slaby did not respond to interview requests. © 2016 San Jose Mercury News syndicated under contract with NewsEdge.

Amy Gesenhues on September 7, 2016 at 7:10 am More Google is marking the start of the 2016 Paralympics today with an animated image on its homepage. Hosted in Rio this year, Google says this is the first time the Paralympics has been held in a Latin American city. Among the 500 athletic events, canoeing and paratriathlon have been added to the games which will run through September 18. The 2016 Paralympics Doodle leads to a search for “start of the 2016 paralympics,” and includes a selection of images to highlight different Paralympic competitions. “What started as a small gathering of British WWII veterans in 1948 has bloomed into the world’s largest sporting event for athletes with physical disabilities, drawing 4,500 athletes from 176 countries worldwide,” reports the Google Doodle blog.

By Jack Wallen | September 7, 2016, 6:27 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen Google Keep is one of those tools I use on a daily basis. Be it from the desktop or from an Android device, Keep keeps me productive in ways some might not find with the average note taking tool. But for some, Keep is nothing more than a means to a jotting down end. Unfortunately, that cross-section of users is missing out on some serious productivity with Keep. With that in mind, I wanted to offer up a few of my best Google Keep tips to help you bring this note taking to more productive levels. Let's go. Tag those notes I have hundreds of notes within Keep. So many that it can become a challenge to find what I need. To prevent getting lost in that sea of notes, I always tag each note as I create them. Sometimes I even have to create new tags on the fly, but every note gets tagged. In the end, this makes it so much easier to find the note I'm looking for. Click on the sandwich menu (top left corner of Keep), select a tag, and Keep will show only those notes that contain the selected tag.

However, when even your tag categories start filling up to the point where finding a note becomes a chore, you can always change the color of a note or add a specific image to make that note stand out. I have two particularly important notes that I go back to on a daily basis. To each of those notes I have added a background color in order to make them very fast to find. I can then click on the Search bar and select the color attached to the notes and they'll appear in the search results. If a color isn't up your alley, attach an image to make the note easy to spot. Collaborate on notes Nothing says productivity like collaboration. It may sound a bit like overkill for a note taking app, but when you have something small that needs to be done (especially on a regular basis and on the go), one of the best tools for that could easily be Google Keep. Create a note and then click on the Share button to give another user access. If you share out numerous notes, you might want to create a tag for each person (or team) you collaborate with, to make those collaborations easier to find. Use the reminders feature On both the mobile and desktop versions of Keep, you can set reminders. Reminders are even created exactly like notes. The only difference is that you can add a time (or location) to the note which serves to pop that reminder up in Google Chrome (which does, of course, imply you must be using Google Chrome) as well as in Google Keep. Reminders are a great way to keep you on top of crucial notes. If you're not sure what reminders you have set, you can always check up on them by clicking the "sandwich" menu (top left corner) and click on Reminders to view all of your pending reminders. Archive over delete When you're done with a note, you have two options: Archive or Delete. I tend to create a lot of notes that get reused. For those notes, I always archive them when they are complete. By archiving, I can go into the archives, find the old note, and unarchive it. If I'm certain I won't need the note at a later date (for whatever reason), I'll just delete it. Note to self One of the best Google Keep features you'll use on the go is the Note to self feature. This does require you to have your Okay Google command set up (which can be done from within the Google Now settings in Google Launcher). Once all this is taken care of, you can then say, "Okay Google" followed by "Note to self". Speak your note, when prompted, and then make sure to select Google Keep (if this is the first time you've used the "Note to self" feature). The note will be saved to Google Keep in both text and audio format. Speaking of voice Did you know you can use the Google Now voice control to either create new or add to existing lists? Say you have a Google Keep bulleted listed called "Shopping". If you say "Okay Google" followed by "add to my Shopping list" and then, when prompted, speak the items you want to add to the list, Google will either create the new list or append those items to the existing list. When you're finished listing off new items, say "I'm finished" and the list will be saved. This can be used for any list you have created on Keep (just replace "Shopping" with the title of the list to be used). Send a note to Google Docs Sometimes Keep isn't enough for a note. You might find yourself adding more and more to a single note, until that note becomes a bit unwieldy. Fear not, you can send that note over to Google Docs and open it as a text document for even more power. To do this, open the note, click on the three vertical dots, click Copy to Google Doc, and then head over to your Google Drive and open the newly created document. Save to Keep There's a Chrome extension I depend upon throughout the day. The extension is called Google Keep Chrome Extension and it allows me, with a single click, to save a web page to Google Keep. This handy little tool makes it easy for me to remember to go back to sites (or take notes about sites), etc. If you're an incredibly busy, multitasking machine, you should install this extension right away. Your productivity with Google Keep will skyrocket. Keyboard shortcuts Did you know Google Keep offers some pretty swell keyboard shortcuts? Those most handy of the shortcuts are: c - Create new note o - Open selected note Enter - Edit a selected note Esc - Close an open note j - Go to previous note k - Go to the next note n - Go to the previous list item p - Go to the next list item Ctrl or Command + g - Switch between list and grid view / - Search e - Archive the selected note # - Delete the selected note Get these shortcuts burned into your memory and you'll have a much more productive time with Keep. Do know that not all keyboard shortcuts work on all platforms. Done and done There you have it! Ten of my best productivity tips with Google Keep. Are there more? Of course. But if you implement even some of these, you'll find yourself working more efficiently and getting more productivity out of what, to some, is nothing more than a note taking tool.

Weeks after leaving her eponymous news website to launch a corporate wellness service called Thrive, Arianna Huffington has hired former New York Times and Google executives for the new venture, aiming to teach companies to "treat the whole human being."  As it enters the crowded workplace wellness industry, with its quit-smoking incentives and step challenges, Thrive intends to go beyond the usual offerings to focus on "the mental aspects of our lives, what's happening in our heads," Huffington said in an interview. "This is all something that you bring to work," she added. Huffington spent more than a decade running the Huffington Post, which she founded in 2005, but over the years her interest shifted from news to the pursuit of elusive work-life balance. In the last two years, she has published two books—Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder and the nap-at-work manifesto The Sleep Revolution—full of theories she's now spinning into her new business. Last month, she announced she was leaving her namesake site to pursue her latest venture. Thrive will officially launch Nov. 30, Huffington said. In the meantime, the company is staffing up: Rajiv Pant, a former chief technology officer at the New York Times, has come on as CTO, and Kathryn Friedrich, who spent the better part of a decade at Google and YouTube, will join next month as chief marketing officer. Both said Huffington's plea for a more humane work-life balance drew them to the organization. "I was truly stressed out. This is something I personally connected with," said Pant. "If you look at my tweets, they're about behavior, getting enough sleep. This is the right company."  Friedrich thinks Thrive can create a more positive work-life experience than even Google, considered an Eden of workplace culture. "Google tries to create a good existence for their employees. They do a fantastic job," she said. "The one thing that might be missing that Arianna wants to bring to the table are metrics. It's one thing to put all the offerings out there. It’s another thing to measure the success of those things." (Google is known for studying its company culture's effects on employees' productivity and happiness.) At its core, Thrive is a corporate wellness consultancy: Companies pay Thrive-trained coaches to bestow health and wellness tips on their overworked and underperforming staffs. They can opt for online courses or in-person trainings, with sessions ranging from a couple of hours to six weeks. Huffington said that the consulting firm Accenture has already piloted trainings and that JPMorgan Chase has also signed on for a partnership. In addition to its courses, Thrive will also have a media arm, as Bloomberg reported in June. Huffington has previously said Thrive is not a media company but said in an interview that it will have "a consumer platform attached to the corporate platform that will be constantly reinforcing our message." Much like the Huffington Post, the site will rely on big names, like athletes and experts, for its content. It will also sell wellness-related products like pillows and food supplements, and Huffington hopes it will eventually become a discussion platform open to the public—something the company is working on with Medium, she said.  The sell? All of this, in theory, services Thrive's clients' bottom lines. But with its entry into the corporate wellness industry, which market research firm IBISWorld values at $6 billion, Thrive is competing within an already crowded space. And Huffington—who champions digital detoxing, office napping and actually unplugging on vacation—is not alone in pushing mindfulness on companies. Many other wellness companies address both body and mind, too, offering office fitness alongside meditation. (Here's just one example.) Corporate wellness budgets have ballooned as companies try to curb health insurance costs, since a healthier workforce means lower insurance costs and higher productivity. But a much-cited RAND Corporation study has called many such wellness offerings into question, finding that for all the money poured into them, they save little on health care: For every $1 spent on "lifestyle management" programs—like smoking cessation and weight-loss initiatives—companies saved just 50 cents, the study found. Huffington is confident Thrive's holistic approach will yield better results for both clients and workers, saying the Rand study "really didn't address things like stress and burnout." Thrive, she said, will rely only on "evidence-based" methods for its courses; it has hired Adam Grant, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, to study its work with Accenture. "As we get more evidence, we will be adopting and adjusting everything we are doing," said Huffington. Maybe napping at the office only works during certain times of day? Or maybe meetings are actually better when everyone has a cell phone? For now, in its own SoHo offices, Thrive plans to practice what it preaches. Meetings will be device-free. ("We have beautiful notebooks," said Huffington.) And, yes, there will be a place to nap. Health CareSmall BusinessTechnology Get Crain's Daily Alert Sign up for our FREE daily email newsletter.

Andy Melton via Fickr By James Brumley September 8, 2016 A week or so ago, yours truly here penned some thoughts about why Twitter Inc. (TWTR) would finally get bought out after years of such rumors making their rounds. The core of the acquisition rationale ultimately had to do with the value of Twitter stock and the subsequent market cap for the company — each of the microblogging platform’s regular users would only cost a suitor about $46. See Also from Kiplinger: Why I Keep Buying Apple Stock It sounds like a lot, but considering Facebook Inc. (FB) paid $42 per user when it bought WhatsApp in 2014, not to mention the fact that each Facebook user is now worth (relative to the company’s market cap) more than $200 apiece, $46 per head doesn’t seem like much. Advertisement There was another dimension to the discussion: Which potential buyer has the best shot at doing something fruitful with Twitter users? They are, after all, a crowd that prefers fewer bells and whistles. They’re not even big on an abundance of words. See Also from InvestorPlace: 5 Stocks to Sell for September It’s this nuance, in fact, that may be more of a factor than the suppressed value of Twitter Inc when it comes to a Twitter acquisition. Who’s Going to Buy It? Advertisement Ask ten fans and followers of TWTR stock which peer or competitor is most likely to make a play on Twitter, and you’ll get at least four or five different answers. There’s a clear leader among the presumed frontrunner of a Twitter deal, however, and that’s Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL). It’s not bad logic. Alphabet has been fairly cozy with Twitter of late, adding tweets to Google’s search results (in near real time) as of late last year, at least for desktop searches. There’s been no measurable direct impact on revenue for either company, although one could argue that giving web users more of what they wanted with their searches is good for Google, while giving Twitter more traffic is clearly good for Twitter. It’s also clear that much of what Alphabet touches turns to gold sooner or later. A blogging and social media platform, however, may be an exception to that norm. Yes, part of the reason one can and should have doubts about Google wanting or effectively using Twitter is its disappointment that was Google Plus. Google just never knew quite what it was supposed to be. It may not fully “get” Twitter either, and knows it. Something would have to change to make it work. Advertisement That leaves Facebook as Twitter’s most likely suitor. Too obvious? You’ll get no disagreement from me that the premise is far too predictable to actually predict; the market has a penchant for dishing out surprises. This is a union that makes too much sense to not expect, however. As much as Twitter has tried not to be like Facebook, the two organizations are much more alike than they are different. If Facebook could spin Twitter as “Facebook Lite” to advertisers as well as users, it just might catch on in a way it hasn’t yet. Proponents of this theory can also point out that WhatsApp and Instagram were a bit out of Facebook’s wheelhouse at one time, and Facebook acquired them both anyway. Advertisement That said, there’s still one more serious contender in this race, with better odds of doing a deal than you might expect. The third-place possibility (behind Alphabet, which is next in line after Facebook) is … Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). Don’t laugh. Remember, this is the same company that is moving into new territory with its recent purchase of Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO). Verizon clearly thinks it can do more with Yahoo than CEO Marissa Mayer was ever able to do with it. One of the main reasons Verizon wanted Yahoo was to leverage Yahoo’s growing presence in the mobile video market, perhaps transforming it into an outright over-the-top television alternative. Don’t forget that Verizon is wading deeper into the flexible television market with its FIOS skinny bundles, and Twitter already has a relationship with the NFL — perhaps the biggest draw in professional sports — broadcasting live games. It would be a real coup for Verizon to add the NFL to its list of content partners. Finally, although a distant fourth in terms of odds, it wouldn’t be completely stunning if Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) set its sights on Twitter. Amazon just wants to have a constant, in-your-face presence, and is willing to pay any price to get it. Twitter would be a step in that direction, particularly on the AI front. Besides, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos doesn’t mind trying crazy things, even if his failures cost a fortune. At the very least it would be interesting to see where he might take Twitter. Bottom Line for Twitter Stock While the prospects for a Twitter acquisition are rising, that alone is still a lousy sole reason to own TWTR stock. There’s no certainty as to when, or even if, Twitter will actually attract a groom. See Also from InvestorPlace: Apple Inc. Unveiling New Beats Headphones Alongside iPhone 7 The possibility of a buyout in conjunction with even just a mildly compelling reason to own TWTR in case a deal doesn’t pan out, however, makes Twitter stock an interesting speculation. You could certainly do a lot worse. This article is from James Brumley of InvestorPlace. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

These new speakers are designed as potential competition to Sonos (and others), offering multi-room functionality and more… The $249 SmartCast Crave 360 is a portable speaker with omni-directional 2.1 audio which can output up to 95db of sound. The speaker is portable with 8 hours of battery life, and can later be charged via a wireless charging base. The $299 Crave Pro is slightly louder, but also adds dual-subwoofers for better bass. Both speakers have a touch panel which can be turned to adjust volume levels or tapped/swiped for playback control. To provide a step up over Sonos, both of these speakers can be used either with WiFi through Google Cast, or with Bluetooth. Vizio of course pushes WiFi as offering a better audio experience, which it does, but also makes a point that by using Google Cast, these new speakers skip over proprietary software and allow customers to cast music directly from their favorite music apps, including Spotify, Google Play Music, and anything else with Google Cast compatibility. Vizio will also be offering an app to control the speakers. The SmartCast Crave 360 is available today from Vizio’s website as well as Sam’s Club. The SmartCast Crave Pro will be available “soon” only from the company’s website. Hopefully both speakers will be available from other retailers in time. VIZIO Expands VIZIO SmartCast Collection with Addition of All-New Multi-Room Speakers Designed for Whole-Home Audio Entertainment VIZIO SmartCast Crave ProTM and Crave 360TM Speakers Fully Integrate Google Cast™ for Simple WiFi Streaming Irvine, CA – September 7, 2016 – VIZIO, Inc., America’s #1 sound bar company, announced today the launch of its all-new VIZIO SmartCast™ audio offerings, the versatile VIZIO SmartCast Crave Pro and Crave 360 Speakers. Shaking up the multi-room speaker category, the Crave collection is designed for easy, multi-room audio throughout the entire home. With multiple speakers, consumers can play different songs in each room of the house or the same song in every room. The Crave Pro serves as a stationary speaker for consumers looking to revamp a room with resounding 2.1 audio with dual integrated subwoofers, while the Crave 360 offers 360˚omnidirectional portable audio, perfect to take into the backyard or move about the home. Both speakers fully integrate Google Cast, allowing users to stream millions of songs from Google Cast-enabled audio apps that music listeners already have on their mobile devices, directly to the speakers over WiFi. Since the Crave collection is part of the VIZIO SmartCast entertainment ecosystem, both speakers are controllable by the VIZIO SmartCast app which transforms iOS or Android mobile devices into powerful touchscreen remotes. The all-new VIZIO SmartCast Crave 360 Speakers are available now at an MSRP of $249.99 at VIZIO.com and SamsClub.com. The VIZIO SmartCast Crave Pro Speakers are coming soon to VIZIO.com at an MSRP of $299.99. The new VIZIO SmartCast app simplifies the entire whole-home audio experience, allowing users to turn their iOS or Android mobile devices into a Crave speaker remote for seamless play, pause and volume control from anywhere in the home. The app makes it incredibly convenient for consumers to search, discover, browse and cast their favorite music to Crave speakers in any room. Seamless multi-room functionality allows users to cast the same song, or send a different song, to multiple cast-enabled speakers and sound bars connected to the home WiFi network. While conventional home audio speakers typically connect solely via Bluetooth, the new VIZIO Crave speaker collection allows consumers to stream their favorite music, podcasts and internet radio stations over WiFi as well as Bluetooth. With WiFi streaming, listeners are no longer interrupted by phone calls, texts and other disruptive notifications that commonly occur when streaming over Bluetooth. WiFi streaming also helps conserve battery usage on mobile devices, and frees up the mobile devices for other tasks. Best of all, WiFi steaming allows for better audio quality compared to Bluetooth. “We set out to create the most easy-to-use multi-room streaming audio solutions for consumers that deliver high quality audio performance,” said Matt McRae, Chief Technology Officer, VIZIO. “The Crave collection allows consumers to seamlessly cast to any of the speakers or even a VIZIO SmartCast sound bar, and control their audio right from their mobile device using the VIZIO SmartCast app. Coupled with premium industrial design that enhances any room, the VIZIO SmartCast speakers offer the easiest way to create a whole-home audio system that works with apps consumers already use on their smartphones.” For consumers seeking superior audio quality, the VIZIO SmartCast Crave Pro Speaker delivers room-filling sound with deep bass. With a satin aluminum finish, the Crave Pro sits perfectly on an office bookshelf or living room side table. Crystal clear 2.1 home audio brings listeners’ favorite songs to life with custom-crafted drivers that produce up to 102 dB2 of dynamic sound and an integrated dual subwoofer pumping out bass as low as 40 Hz. For those who want flexibility to move music around the home, consumers will appreciate the VIZIO SmartCast Crave 360 Speaker. Featured in the music video for the new OneRepublic single “Kids,” the Crave 360 offers 360˚ omnidirectional 2.1 home audio and houses custom-crafted drivers that produce up to 95 dB2 of dynamic sound with 50Hz bass. The Crave 360 speaker comes with a wireless charging base and runs up to 8 hours3 so music can be played anywhere in the home using WiFi or Bluetooth to stream music. In addition, the Crave 360 boasts a leather carrying strap for secure, grab-and-go convenience. While both the Crave Pro and Crave 360 work seamlessly with the VIZIO SmartCast app, if consumers want to manually control their speaker from nearby, both products feature a glass touch dial that allows users to tap to play, swipe to skip and twist to increase or decrease volume levels4. With Google Cast built into every VIZIO SmartCast multi-room speaker, consumers can easily stream millions of songs from music apps they already know and love. Just tap the Cast button to stream music directly over WiFi to any VIZIO SmartCast speaker from anywhere in the home. Unlike other multi-room speakers that use proprietary software, VIZIO SmartCast speakers make streaming simple with Google Cast. Consumers can simply Cast from music apps they already have on their mobile devices.

The message is clear from the Pixel launch: in 2016, it's all about being "Made By Google." Here is everything you need to know about the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Google Pixel: Manufacturer Two smartphones, probably made by HTC Launched as Pixel devices, not Nexus Google has changed things up for 2016, opting for Pixel branding instead of Nexus. Of course, Google hasn't just built a factory that assembles smartphones so a manufacturer is behind the Pixel and Pixel XL, though it might never be confirmed who. The weight of rumours suggest HTC is responsible, and both devices look like HTC-built handsets, even if we will likely only ever know them as "Made By Google". Sources talking to The Information earlier in 2016 claimed that Google was looking to play a much greater role in the hardware design, as well as software, making the smartphone manufacturer more of a contractor than a partner, which has clearly happened. Google Nexus vs Google Pixel: What's the difference? Google Pixel XL review: Android's new heavyweight champion Google Pixel review: Pure, wonderful, enhanced Android Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Design Metal body with an upper rear section made of glass Same design, different sizes, both 8.6mm slim Rear fingerprint sensor The Pixel is the smaller of the two devices, while the Pixel XL is the larger, suggested in its name. The Pixel measures 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.6mm and weighs 143g, while the Pixel XL measures 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.6mm and weighs 168g. Both have the same design, offering a mostly metal build with a glass panel for the top third of the rear. Within this panel is a centralised, circular fingerprint sensor, while the rear camera and flash sit flush in the top left corner. There's a chamfer at the front edges, similar to what you'll find on the HTC 10. Speakers are positioned at the bottom of the devices, either side of the USB Type-C charging port. The power button and volume rocker are both on the right-hand side of the device but that's it when it comes to physical buttons. The front of both handsets sees just a speaker at the top, with a sensor below and a front camera in the top on the left. The Pixel and Pixel XL will be available in Quite Black, Very Silver and Really Blue colour options. Google Pixel XL preview: A new, costly, Google overlord Google Pixel mocks iPhone with 'Quite Black', 'Very Silver' and 'Really Blue' colours Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Display Google Pixel has a 5-inch Full HD display Google Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch Quad HD display Both offer Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection As we mentioned above, the Pixel is the smaller of the two new devices, offering a 5-inch AMOLED display. It has a Full HD resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 441ppi and it has Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. The Google Pixel XL has a Quad HD resolution across its 5.5-inch display, meaning a slightly higher pixel density of 534ppi. It too is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it also offers AMOLED technology.  The AMOLED technology should mean we can expect rich and vibrant colours from the Pixel and Pixel XL. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Camera Pixel and Pixel XL both have 12.3-megapixel rear camera Both devices have an 8-megapixel front camera The Google Pixel and Pixel XL both have a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with a f/2.0 aperture and 1.55µm pixels, like last year's Nexus 6P. The front of both devices also sees an 8-megapixel camera, again like the Nexus 6P. In terms of features, there is video image stabilisation and something called Smartburst, which is claimed to be great for capturing action shots. Additionally, the Pixel and Pixel XL camera will also use a feature called HDR+ by default. This is said to produce clear, vivid results even in challenging conditions by minimising noise and extending dynamic range, by fusing multiple shots together. Google Pixel XL vs Nexus 6P: What's the difference? Google Pixel vs Nexus 5X: What's the difference? Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Hardware and specs The Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones offer almost identical hardware specifications, which might not come as much of a surprise given the similarities in camera and design. Pixel specs Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB RAM, 32GB/128GB storage 5-inch 1920 x 1080 resolution display, 441ppi 2770mAh battery The Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip sits under the hood, supported by 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage. There is no microSD support, which will come as no surprise to Nexus fans. A 2770mAh battery is under the hood, supporting Quick Charge, which offers users 7 hours charge in 15 minutes. Google Pixel preview: Arise my Pixel apprentice Pixel XL specs Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB RAM, 32GB/128GB storage 5.5-inch 2560 x 1440 resolution display, 534ppi 3450mAh battery It was suggested that the Pixel XL would be the larger and more powerful handset, but instead, it has turned out the only difference is size. Like the Pixel, it has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip, which is a tweaked version of the 820, offering a 10 per cent performance increase over the Snapdragon 820. Qualcomm itself mentions virtual reality several times when talking about this chipset so the Daydream-readiness is not surprising. Like the Pixel, the Pixel XL comes in 32GB and 128GB models, and again, there is no microSD support. A 3450mAh battery capacity keeps things ticking along, with Quick Charging on board again, like the Pixel.  Google Pixel vs Pixel XL: What's the difference? Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Software Android Nougat 7.1, with new Pixel Launcher Round icons Google Assistant built-in The Pixels arrive with the next version of Android from the box, called Android Nougat. Although this was released recently, the Pixels are running an updated version with 7.1. There is a new launcher and all the apps are now round like the Chrome app. The Pixels are the first phones to feature Google Assistant built-in and they are also the first Daydream-ready phones. Google Duo, a video calling app will be pre-installed and the Pixels will also come with unlimited storage for photos and videos, through Google Photos. Android 7.0 Nougat review: Subtle but super-sweet OS update Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Release date and price Release date 20 October Pixel has a starting price of £599/$649 Pixel XL has a starting price of £719 The Pixel and Pixel XL will be available from 20 October, with pre-orders starting in the UK, US, Australia, Canada and Germany on the Google Store from 4 October. India will be able to pre-order from 13 October. Prices for the Pixel start at £599/$649 or $27 a month in the US. Prices for the Pixel XL start at £719, creeping up to £819 for the 128GB. The Pixels will be available through the Google Store, EE, Dixons Carphone, Verizon, Best Buy, Project Fi, Rogers, Telus, Bell, Wireless Wave, T-Mobile, Telstra, JB Hi-Fi, Flipkart, Reliance Digital and Croma.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Everything you need to know about Google’s Huawei-made Nexus tablet Julian Chokkattu Digital TrendsSeptember 26, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Huawei is rumored to be manufacturing Google's upcoming Nexus 7 successor, and it's rumored to run a new operating system that merges Android and Chrome OS. It's unclear whether the device will be branded as a Nexus or a Pixel.More After three years, Google may be gearing up to refresh its 2013 Nexus 7. Despite the rumored Pixel-branding for its upcoming smartphones, the 7-inch tablet may hold onto the Nexus name. Here’s everything you need to know. Andromeda OS? The Huawei-made Nexus 7 successor shockingly may not run Android. Instead, it may run a new operating system that merges Android and Chrome OS — it’s known internally as Andromeda. Both Android Police and 9to5Google say Andromeda exists, but the former reported the merged OS will land on a laptop nicknamed Pixel 3, codenamed Bison. The laptop-tablet hybrid is expected to land some time next year, but 9to5Google says we may see Andromeda earlier on the Nexus tablet. Andromeda would essentially bring desktop capability to Android devices. We don’t have any other information of what it looks like and how it runs, but we may get a sneak peek at Google’s October 4 event. Google is reportedly testing early builds of Andromeda on the Nexus 9, though 9to5Google says the company will not release the OS publicly on the 2014 device. The Pixel laptop targets MacBook Pro users, and the Nexus tablet seems to sit more in line as a developer-focused device, just like previous Nexus smartphones and tablets. Specs German site HuaweiBlog.de has some leaked information about the specs on the upcoming Nexus/Pixel tablet. The 7-inch AMOLED display will have a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels, and will be powered by the Snapdragon 820 and an Adreno 530 GPU. It will be packed with 4GB of RAM, which was initially reported by @evleaks, and the base storage offering will be 64GB. The rear camera will be packed with 13 megapixels. We can’t verify any of this information, so take it with a grain of salt. A Huawei-built tablet Rumors about a 2016 Nexus 7 have been circulating since last year, and one piece of information has been consistent — Huawei will be manufacturing the tablet. It’s not the first collaboration between Google and the Chinese smartphone manufacturer — the Nexus 6P has that honor, and has been widely praised as one of the best Nexus devices to date. Related: RIP Google Nexus? This year’s Nexus phones may not be Nexus phones at all We do know that Huawei is manufacturing a device for Google — a company official said as much in an interview earlier this year. But while many initially believed it was a Huawei-manufactured smartphone, it’s quite certain the official was referring to the 7-inch slate. After all, HTC has repeatedly been featured in leaks and rumors as the manufacturer for Google’s upcoming smartphones. There hasn’t been a lot of information within the past year about the rumored tablet until now. Notable leaker Evan Blass, also known as @evleaks on Twitter, has posted sparse details about the tablet, bringing further confirmation about the device’s existence. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 And that’s more or less all the information we have about the tablet. It has a 7-inch display, comes with 4GB of RAM and is expected to launch at the end of the year. We can’t verify this information, so take it with a grain of salt. Nexus or Pixel? The new HTC-built Google smartphones are expected to be called the Pixel and the Pixel XL. That sparked rumors that Google is shutting down the Nexus line. 9to5Google’s chief Stephen Hall thinks different, and says Google may be keeping the Nexus branding for the tablet. Related: Google may launch Home, Daydream, 4K Chromecast, and Pixel phones on October 4 Pixel initially represented Google’s high-end Chromebook, but the line expanded after the company unveiled the first Pixel-branded tablet just last year. The 10.2-inch Pixel C cost $500, certainly a lot more than previous Nexus tablets. It’s unclear whether a high price tag will follow suit for the 7-inch device, whether or not it’s branded as a Pixel or a Nexus. The Nexus 7 (2012 and 2013) became popular because of their low price tag, so perhaps the 2016 refresh will maintain that expectation. Availability and price We’ll have to wait and see whether the price jump in the Pixel line applies to the 7-inch variant. The Pixel C launched in December of 2015, so it’s likely we could see a similar release window for the unnamed 7-inch tablet. That’s 2 months after the Pixel smartphones and a slew of other Google devices are expected to launch. We’ll update this post as we learn more information. Article originally published in December.

The Android 7.0 Nougat update was rolled out to the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C tablet, and Android One General Mobile 4G devices gradually. Now, the company has started rolling out the monthly Android security update for September. The company has also released factory images and OTA binaries for Nexus devices. The September security bulletin is now available to Nexus through an over-the-air (OTA) update. Google has also released the new Nexus firmware images to the Google Developer site. Google says that it notified the partners about the issues described in the bulletin on August 05, 2016 or earlier. The source code patches for the reported issues will be released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository in the next 48 hours.The update patches seven vulnerabilities that have been flagged as "critical" by Google, and 23 vulnerabilities that fall on the spectrum of "high" severity. In addition, 17 "moderate" security glitches have also been resolved. Some of the critical security vulnerabilities that have been fixed include remote code execution vulnerability in LibUtils, which if left untreated will enable an attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code in the context of a privileged process; remote code execution vulnerability in Mediaserver, which if not resolved could enable an attacker using a specially crafted file to cause memory corruption during media file and data processing; elevation of privilege vulnerability in kernel security subsystem; elevation of privilege vulnerability in kernel networking subsystem, elevation of privilege vulnerability in kernel netfilter subsystem, and elevation of privilege vulnerability in kernel USB driver, and elevation of privilege vulnerability in kernel shared memory subsystem, which if left untreated could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. These issues are rated as "Critical" due to the possibility of a local permanent device compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device. Apart from September Android security patch, Google is also rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat factory images for Nexus range. New Android 7.0 build for Pixel C is NRD90R; Nexus 5X is NRD90S; Nexus Player is NRD90R; Nexus 9 Wi-Fi is NRD90R, and Nexus 5 is MOB31E. Unfortunately, Google is yet to rollout Android 7.0 factory images for the Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, and Nexus 9 LTE devices.

The Rogers Business App Market is an online portal where small businesses across Canada can purchase and manage business applications such as email, payroll, accounting, and scheduling. “Many of our customers today are stretched thin, having to spend hours of time managing business applications. We want to make it simple and easy to use business applications, so we’ve launched our Business App Market with the latest apps and dedicated support. Our goal is to provide access to a variety of apps that small businesses can easily use to run their businesses more efficiently,” said Craig Bentley, senior vice-president of small enterprise at Rogers, in a statement. As part of this program, two application services are available to Rogers Business App Market customers; Google Apps for Work as well as Microsoft Office 365. “Google’s collaboration capabilities are what businesses are asking for in order to work the way their employees want to work. Working with Rogers, we are able to provide these solutions to more Canadian clients easily. We’re excited to bring Google innovation and scale to more Canadian small businesses through this partnership,” said James Lambe, country manager of Google for Work Canada. In addition to apps and organization for those apps, Rogers will also be offering small businesses tech support as well as the day to day software administration of their apps. With a single login and password, customers can gain access to all their cloud services. “The way we work is changing rapidly and at Microsoft it is our belief that productivity is at the heart of business success,” said Charlotte Burke, head of small and midmarket solutions & partners at Microsoft Canada. “We are excited to be working with Rogers to bring the best of Microsoft Cloud services with a high quality service and ease of access to help small and mid-size businesses in Canada achieve more in the digital age.” While small businesses are currently doing more with less, the Rogers Business App Market has the potential to ease the burden. Several new productivity apps will be launching in the coming months.

The update bumps Chrome to version 53 and adds Android Pay mobile payments support, along with performance improvements.TOI Tech | Sep 7, 2016, 06.09 PM IST NEW DELHI: Search giant Google has rolled out a new update for its Chrome browser. The update bumps Chrome to version 53 and adds Android Pay mobile payments support, along with performance improvements. Google has added support for the Payment Request web standard, which introduces faster checkouts with a single tap. As per the company, the update brings battery improvements for devices by reducing the browser's battery consumption for frequently visited websites. The company also claims that the new version of Chrome for Android is 15% faster as compared to earlier versions. The tech giant also claims that Chrome for Mac now uses 33% less power for videos, images, page scrolling and more. Google updates Contacts app on Android, adds new features Google has updated its Contacts app for Android. The update introduces quite some new features and improvements, including a revamped design. Last month, Google announced that Chrome will start blocking behind-the-scenes Flash content. The search giant said that Chrome will start blocking Flash-based content such as page analytics. The move is likely to lead to faster page load times and improved battery life for devices. Apart from blocking Flash content, Google also announced that it will have HTML5 as the default standard for games and videos on Chrome 55. The change will affect both games and videos, and will be effective starting December. This is claimed to provide a better, safer and more power-efficient browsing experience to users. The company also said that websites that exclusively support Flash will remain unaffected by this.

Even Chrome seven versions back lasts longer on a Windows 10 Surface Book than Edge, according to Google. By Liam Tung | September 7, 2016 -- 12:53 GMT (05:53 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Three months after Microsoft's showed Edge walloping Chrome in a battery test, Google has called those results into question by showing off Chrome on Microsoft's Surface Book. According to Microsoft's tests, which were also conducted on Surface Books, Edge on Windows 10 on average consumed 36 percent less power than Chrome when using it on sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Google. Microsoft's other test showed Chrome and Edge squaring off in a video-streaming battle on Surface Books. The Edge device lasted seven hours and 22 minutes, while the Chrome device petered out after just four hours and 19 minutes. Now, with Chrome 53 out, which contains a number of CPU and GPU improvements, Google has offered its rebuttal in the form of a time-lapse video comparing the battery life of two Surface Books, again streaming video in a browser. But instead of pitting Chrome against Edge, Google opted to show Chrome 46 against Chrome 53. Despite the absence of Edge in the test, Google still managed to take a swipe at Microsoft on two fronts. Rather subtly, Google simply says Chrome 53 gives two hours 12 minutes more Vimeo HD on a single charge than Chrome 46. However, instead of the four hours and 22 minutes that Microsoft clocked for Chrome for Windows in its time-lapse video, Google's time-lapse video pointedly captures Chrome 46 lasting eight hours and 27 minutes. Meanwhile, Chrome 53 lasts a whopping 10 hours and 39 minutes. So, not only does Chrome perform better than Microsoft claimed, but even Chrome seven versions back seems to outperform Microsoft's newest browser. Google also boasts of Chrome's wider support for other platforms, including speed improvements it has made for Chrome on mobile devices and Chrome on Mac, which it says now uses 33 percent less power for video, images and page scrolling.

Smartphone users, who don't know how to install the OS manually or don't want to go through the procedure, can now download it via OTA (over-the-air). The search giant had released Android 7.0 Nougat final build to all the eligible devices -- Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and Android One -- on Aug. 22, but not via OTA. Following queries from impatient fans on its Twitter handle, the company said a few days later that the firmware will be available via OTA, but would take a few weeks to reach some devices as the roll out happens in phases.

Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com ([https://crt.sh/?id=30773634 SHA-1], [https://crt.sh/?id=15425430 SHA-256]) and mail.gd.gov.cn ([https://crt.sh/?id=12356371 SHA-1], [https://crt.sh/?id=12362293 SHA-256]).         Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated) but where the SCT date is nevertheless before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating does not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks.     Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated) but where the SCT date is nevertheless before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating does not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks.   Line 270: Line 270:   Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm.   Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm.   </i></blockquote>   </i></blockquote>   +   + (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.)       ===WoSign Response===   ===WoSign Response=== Revision as of 04:50, 7 September 2016 This page lists all confirmed or suspected issues involving the CA "WoSign".

"Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers. (It is not clear if these were all the same number, or in pairs, or some other combination.) This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. However, they have misclassified at least one - line 2 of Figure 14 - so the actual split may be different. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which may violate section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is unknown but probably at least 60. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, note that the above certs all have the same notAfter date, which is not exactly 1 year (or any other standard time period) after the notBefore. And the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) If we look for other certs matching this pattern, we find a total of 62 certificates in crt.sh and other sources. Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, the ID of certificates in WoSign's CT log can be used to show the logging sequence of a set of certificates even if they don't have embedded SCTs, because the IDs are sequential. If you order all certs in WoSign's log by ID, up to ID 109149, where the notBefore is on December 31st, the notBefore values are (approximately) chronologically ordered. Those which have embedded SCTs have timestamps which are about 2 hours later than the notBefore date. But after that follow 64 certificates which are all dated on December 20, 2015 (CST, UTC+8). This suggests that these were logged at the actual time of issuance but that time is not reflected in their notBefore date - i.e. they were backdated. And it further suggests that this behaviour only began after December 31st 2015, i.e. it was not a continuation of some previous behaviour. Thirdly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated) but where the SCT date is nevertheless before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating does not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue has not yet been officially drawn to the attention of WoSign. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. Using the value "1" led to a certificate which had a notBefore date (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which was signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. (XXX To investigate: did the chain contain some SHA-256 certs?) The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open.

CEO Larry Page's transition to Alphabet is getting savaged in the media. Should you buy into the bearishness? Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Sep 7, 2016 at 7:51AM Image source: Alphabet. Last year, Larry Page, then CEO of Google, announced the company's transition to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). On Alphabet's investor relations website, Page outlined the reasons for the transition: better accountability, independence, and focus. For investors, Alphabet would separate its core Google operations from its other independent companies, dubbed "other bets" when reporting company financials. Recent reports from technology-focused websites point to continual struggles in Alphabet's other bets segments. The Information noted Google Fiber's chief, Craig Barratt, almost left post-transition because he was concerned the company's new structure would make it harder to attain assets. It appears those fears were prudent as the company has now been ordered to cut costs. In an article aggregating Google Fiber's woes, a push for profitability that pushed Nest CEO Tony Fadell out, employee losses in its self-driving car project, the recent suspension of Alphabet's swappable-smartphone-components project, named Ara, and a rumored shakeup of the company's secretive lab X segment, Business Insider calls Larry Page's Alphabet transition a "mess." Investors should ignore the hyperbole and focus on the company's operations. CFO Porat appears to be more focused on controlling expenses than predecessor Pichette After taking the Alpahebt's CFO reins in May 2015 after leaving investment firm Morgan Stanley, Ruth Porat instituted a change of tone in regard to then-Google's "earlier stage" products and expenses. For a comparison, previous CFO Patrick Pichette discussed Google Fiber in terms of innovation and "pushing the envelope," and did not address expenses in a meaningful way in his last earnings conference call (the first quarter of 2015). Porat's second-quarter introduced the terms "tight governance" in regard to resources for Fiber, Life Sciences, and Nest. Additionally, Porat mentioned "discipline in expense management" as a reason for year-on-year expense-growth deceleration and a 1% sequential decrease in expenses. In the third quarter, Alphabet decided to return those savings, and then some, to investors by instituting a share buyback program in excess of $5 billion. But R&D expenses show Alphabet is still investing Assuming complaints coming from Alphabet's "other bets" segments are valid, it appears Alphabet is not cutting spending on investor-desired research and development.  Metric Q2 '16 Q1 '16 FY '15 Q3 '15 Q2 '15 Q1 '15 FY '14 Q3 '14 Revenue $21.5 $20.3 $75.0 $18.7 $17.7 $17.3 $66.0 $16.5 R&D $3.4 $3.4 $12.3 $3.2 $2.8 $2.8 $9.8 $2.7 R&D/revenue 15.6% 16.6% 16.4% 17.3% 15.7% 16% 14.9% 16.1% R&D growth 20.6% 22.3% 24.9% 21.7%         Source: Alphabet 10-K and 10-Q statements. Revenue and R&D figures in billions. FY = fiscal year.  As the table above shows, Alphabet is not cutting spending on research and development. With the exception of the recently reported second quarter, Alphabet has grown its research and development as a percentage of revenue every quarter Porat has been CFO on a year-on-year basis. In fiscal year 2015, the firm increased this statistic 1.7 percentage points.    On a raw-dollar basis, the growth is even more apparent. After taking over in earnest in the second quarter of 2015, research and development spending has increased at least 20% on a year-on-year basis with Porat at the helm. What appears to be occurring is a shift in research and development spend to profitable assets or asking for Alphabet managers to cut spending on non-R&D costs like sales, marketing, general, and administrative functions. Ask yourself why you purchased Alphabet For investors, it  comes down to a question of why you chose to invest in Google or Alphabet. Presumably, most investors purchased the company for its core search and display advertising business. If so, you should appreciate the new austerity measures in these nonessential divisions and the company's recently announced share buyback program. This puts investors at odds with most technology-focused websites, as the news outlets' circulation is better served by new products, even if these products are unprofitable.  In the event you purchased Alphabet in the hope it'd become a technology version of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, and you are betting one of its moonshots becomes the next must-have technology, you may want to reconsider your initial thesis in light of reports about Alphabet's talent departures and capital-allocation policies.  More disciplined spending should show up in future periods Alphabet's other bets were always interesting to discuss, but are not a large part of the company's revenue haul. In the first six months of 2016, even after registering 130% growth, Alphabet's other bets were less than 1% of the company's total revenue. It makes sense for the company to keep a tight rein on expenses here until a path to revenue is reasonably assured. Throughout the first six months of the year, other bets reported $350 million in revenue, but the segment reported $1.6 billion in operating losses. Alphabet's operating income would have been 10% higher if this segment did not exist. If the reports are correct, Alphabet's keeping expenses under control coupled with its share buybacks should increase earnings per share and drive the stock higher.

But staring at a blank Photoshop canvas can be pretty intimidating. A combination of sets, individual elements, icon sets, backgrounds, and more, might serve to be a great jumping off platform for creating your infographic in Photoshop. To get started, or just look for inspiration, there are a ton of great resources to create infographics with Photoshop so you don’t have to start from scratch. Look for PSD Files When searching for free infographic elements and templates, you’ll probably find that they are mostly in one of three formats: AI, EPS, and SVG. While you can open these up in Photoshop, if they’re a set, you won’t be able to adjust elements as individual layers or objects. By contrast, PSD files come complete with Photoshop layers, meaning you can easily edit and use individual components in your design. There are, of course, drawbacks to using templates and not creating this content from scratch yourself. For one, if your data does not fit the template, it will probably be harder to edit than it would be to just create an element from scratch yourself. If you want to use a template for existing data, it might be worth thinking about exactly how you want to represent that data and search for templates based on that specific criteria 24 Google Docs Templates That Will Make Your Life Easier 24 Google Docs Templates That Will Make Your Life Easier Templates can save you lots of time. We compiled 24 time-saving Google Docs templates for work, health, home, and travel. Get on with your projects, rather than struggling with putting together documents. Read More . It also means that your designs will end up being similar to other designs out there, as opposed to coming up with the entire concept yourself. And when downloading anything online, be sure to pay careful attention to the license to ensure that you are adhering to the artist’s wishes as far as commercial use and crediting is concerned. Ads by Google Full PSD Sets The easiest place to start when using premade graphics is with PSD sets. This way you can ensure a consistent style in your graphic, and don’t have to spend hours searching for various icons and graphics that will complement each other. Websites like FreePik and Best PSD Freebies, among others, are a great resource for these kinds of sets. Here’s a selection of what you on find on these sites. Business Infographic Template The screenshot on the Business Infographic template may be a little misleading – you won’t get the full bundle. Instead, you can download three elements from this $15 template available on Creative Market. The three images included, however, are extremely high quality. Infographic PSD Templates This PSD set contains a variety of 15 different types of charts and also includes a timeline template. When you download the template, just switch off the very first layer, and you’ll be able to see all the charts clearly. Just keep in mind that the text in the template is not actually editable but serves as a good guide for placing your own text boxes in the same spot before turning off that layer. Modern Vector Infographics Available as a PSD file for Photoshop users, this set also comes in AI, PNG, SVG, and EPS format. The five infographic templates, together with a set of 16 social media and business icons, can be used to create a small timeline or highlight a global element with its world map. Free Technology Infographic Templates Available as a free download when you provide your email address, this free infographic template comes in three different color schemes. Unlike some of the other sets here, it does offer a completely laid out template. That said, some of the elements won’t be of much use unless your numbers align with the numbers in the template. Loading Progress Bar While not strictly designed for an infographic, you’ll find a lot of UI elements available in PSD format that easily translate into elements for an infographic. What’s nice about this template, in particular, is that it is possible to edit most of the shapes to adjust them based on the figures in your own data. 195 Flat Flags In addition to sets that packed with charts and maps, you can also find sets that can bring a consistent feel to your design, without having to worry about fitting the template to your data. For example, this set of 195 flags would be very useful if you’re creating an infographic with information or stats from various countries. Available in PSD and PNG format, the PSD file is conveniently labeled making it easy to find the exact flag you need. Summer UI Kit Another UI set that really lends itself to infographics is the Summer UI Kit which comes packed with buttons, sliders,  and more. With a little bit of creativity and thinking outside of the box, this set could translate into some great elements for an infographic. Individual Elements and Icons In addition to finding complete sets, you can find some great individual elements. Like I mentioned, this will require a bit more effort if you want a consistent design, but if you’re creating a mini infographic, these kinds of icons and graphics could be super handy. Map Fold Working on an infographic that includes information about certain states in the US? This map of the country with map-markers could come in very handy. Flip Clock Does your infographic include a countdown? Or a measure of how long it took for something to be completed? This flip clock could be what you’re looking for. Flat Apple Device Icons If you’re putting together a tech or Apple infographic, these Apple icons will come in super handy. Each device is its own layer so you can move and place them wherever you want. Infographic Element Sites like FreePik and The Noun Project are also a great resource for finding icon sets. Searching for infographics on The Noun Project turns up some interesting elements and sets you can incorporate into your design. The Infographic Element set is a perfect example of this. You will have to download each icon individually, and they’re available as PNG and SVG files. Backgrounds and Patterns In addition to downloading free icons and templates, you can also find great backgrounds and textures to put the finishing touches on your designs. While you can make your own seamless patterns in Photoshop A Beginner's Guide to Creating Seamless Patterns in Photoshop   A Beginner's Guide to Creating Seamless Patterns in Photoshop   There are several different Photoshop tools you can use to create seamless patterns, whether starting from scratch with a blank canvas, or with an icon you've found online. Read More , if you’re pressed for time, there’s a wide selection available online. A few examples we found include: Hexagonal Geometric Backgrounds Downloading these PNG files will allow you to create seamless patterns in Photoshop. 10 Seamless Blueprint Patterns Downloadable as a Photoshop Pattern file, these Blueprint Patterns could make a great background for an infographic. Multicolor Chevron Patterns This set of retro chevron patterns, also available as a Photoshop Pattern file, will help liven up the background of your design. There are also plenty of free digital pattern packs 20 Free Digital Pattern Packs That You Can Download Now 20 Free Digital Pattern Packs That You Can Download Now High-quality digital patterns are hard to come by, especially if you want them to be free. Here are several that are great that you'll likely love! Read More available online – it’s just a matter of finding the kinds of patterns that work best for you depending on your personal needs. Bonus Resources There are other kinds of resources that you can download that will enhance your design. You can easily add effects to your text with PSD templates. Social Media Stamps can make your icons look like stamps, but in order to download it, you will have to interact with the site on social media by liking or sharing the page, or giving it a +1 on Google. Other PSD templates will allow you to create the illusion of an embossed stamp or make it look like the text has been gold foiled. Don’t have access to Photoshop? There are a few more options worth considering.

Comments Computerworld | Sep 7, 2016 4:00 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup 0 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Security Cloud Storage Cloud Security Comments Earlier this year I switched to Android from iPhone and from Verizon to Google's Project Fi. My blog post about the experience generated a vigorous discussion comparing Google's privacy guarantees to Apple's. The summary of the argument presented to me is that Apple is in the business of hardware and has no interest in monetizing data. By contrast, Google is a "big data company" and it does monetize data. Android, by its nature, may be more vulnerable to malware than iOS. Switching from iPhone to Android does not mean that one is suddenly giving up all of their private data to Google to monetize. Many people already trust their data to companies other than Apple iCloud does not solve all problems and does not address all use cases for all users. It is meant to be used by one user and to share data among that user's devices. There is limited sharing of individual iWork files and photo albums, but certainly not with the same power as Dropbox or Google Drive. Here are the cloud services that I use across all of my devices: iCloud for iOS device backup Google Drive (documents and spreadsheets) for work Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Contacts for both personal and work use Evernote for journaling, writing and note-taking Professional Dropbox subscription where I store both my photo library and my music collection Facebook, Flickr and Instagram for sharing photos and videos with family and friends I may be a power user when it comes to certain services, but I think the general point is valid -- many (if not most) people use multiple cloud services for their needs. iCloud is a far from a privacy nirvana Apple's iCloud is a far cry from censorship resistant Freenet that lets you "escape total surveillance." Most people don't read Apple's iCloud terms and conditions and just click "Accept," but it is worth a thorough examination. Apple reserves the right to screen your iCloud content, regulate what you upload and ensure that your content complies with the laws of your country. Apple does screen your iCloud data. In its legal document, Apple states (observe the catch-all "otherwise objectionable" clause): Apple reserves the right at all times to determine whether Content is appropriate and in compliance with this Agreement, and may pre-screen, move, refuse, modify and/or remove Content at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, if such Content is found to be in violation of this Agreement or is otherwise objectionable. Apple does surrender customer data to law enforcement. Despite the publicity around the San Bernadino iPhone case, Apple does respond to the information requests. In the second half of 2015 the company surrendered device data in as many as 80% of the United States law enforcement requests. The iCloud terms and conditions give Apple freedom to do so: Apple reserves the right to take steps Apple believes are reasonably necessary or appropriate to enforce and/or verify compliance with any part of this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that Apple may, without liability to you, access, use, preserve and/or disclose your Account information and Content to law enforcement authorities, government officials, and/or a third party, as Apple believes is reasonably necessary or appropriate, if legally required to do so. Apple does require you to grant consent to publish data you share: […] by submitting or posting such Content on areas of the Service that are accessible by the public or other users with whom you consent to share such Content, you grant Apple a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Service solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available, without any compensation or obligation to you. Apple’s iCloud terms and conditions have provisions for DMCA to ensure copyright enforcement. Copyright holders can submit copyright infringement claims which may result in an iCloud account getting terminated. There are rumors that Apple may implement an iCloud encryption system that can only be unlocked by the customer. It remains to be seen how that system is going to reconcile with Apple's legal right and obligation to prescreen data and to share it with the law enforcement upon request as per its terms and conditions. Google does analyze your content, but you can work around it For the most part, Google's policies are similar to those of iCloud. Google does not deny that it analyzes your data: Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored. In exchange, users get 15 GB of free Google Drive storage compared to iCloud's 5 GB. If one is already using Google services on their iPhone, switching to Android does not mean that they give up any more privacy than they already have. Google Apps for Business, on the other hand, ensures that Google will not scan your data. At the starting monthly cost of $5/per user you take ownership of all of your data which Google will not analyze. Unlike Google, Dropbox does not monetize your data by scanning it. Similar to iCloud, Dropbox earns money by charging for increased storage and enterprise usage. Dropbox's policy is pretty reasonable and does not grant it the right to screen your data. Evernote scans data but does not monetize it Evernote's terms and conditions are similar to other cloud providers. To offer some of the most advanced search and indexing you must grant Evernote permission to scan your data: By using our products, you give Evernote permission to do certain things with your data so that we can run our service. For example, you give us permission to back it up, send it over a network, index it for searching, display it on your various devices, etc. Evernote, however, is not a "big data" company and does not earn money by monetizing your data: We are not a "big data" company and do not try to make money from your content. Our systems automatically analyze your data in order to power Evernote features, such as search and related notes, and to tell you about important features and products that we think will enhance your Evernote experience, but we never give or sell your content to any third party for advertising purposes. Just like Apple, Google and most other cloud storage providers, Evernote does comply with law enforcement requests. According to its own Transparency Report for 2015, the company has upheld most of the law enforcement demands and responded with data. Evernote did side with Apple in the FBI bypass case, however. Social sharing services require you to grant them permission to publish your content Social sharing wouldn't make sense if you couldn't publish your content. For a service like Facebook to display your content to other users, you need to grant it a license to do so: Yes, you retain the copyright to your content. When you upload your content, you grant us a license to use and display that content. Likewise, your photos on Flickr are always yours but you must give the service permission to publish your content. Instagram is similar: Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Service’s Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy. Again, just like all other cloud services providers, Facebook complies with government requests as does Yahoo/Flickr. So, what’s all this about? Debating my friend on Medium led me to read the terms of service agreement for all of the services I use. The conclusion is simple: We shouldn't fall for Apple's publicity stunts surrounding high-profile government requests. Apple does comply with most law enforcement inquiries by giving up device data. In fact, its terms and conditions grant it more sweeping legal rights over its customers' data than most other providers. Apple can screen your data for "otherwise objectionable" data if it wants to. Many people who already use Google services such as Gmail, Calendar, Contacts and Drive do not give up any more privacy than they already have by switching to Android and continuing to use same services. Google does scan the content stored in personal but not business accounts. You are not required to store sensitive data in the cloud or on your phone. There are many alternatives to iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox and Evernote that do not store or scan your data. You can always use a USB drive, backup your phone to your computer or use a third-party app to encrypt your data. The most important lesson is that customers shouldn't just click "Accept" when presented with a license or terms of service agreement. It is important to read and understand what they agree to.

The answer remains unclear In the era of self-driving cars, insurance will be radically transformed, shifting to cover the tech that powers the vehicles. But when a driverless car gets in a wreck, who's at fault? By Hope Reese | September 7, 2016, 4:00 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus This graphic shows what Google's self-driving car "saw" through its sensors just before it collided with a city bus. Image: Screenshot by Wayne Cunningham/Roadshow By 2021, major automakers—as well as tech companies like Google, Baidu, and Apple—are likely to unveil some form of autonomous driving capability. In Pittsburgh, Uber is now offering the public a chance to hail a ride in their self-driving fleet. And as we see more driverless cars on the road, the burden of driving will shift away from human drivers and onto the machine. The issue of liability is going to play an important role in the advance of driverless vehicles—especially how fast and how widely the movement takes shape. When it comes to safety, the move towards fully-autonomous technology is a positive development. A report from KPMG predicts an 80% drop in accident frequency by 2040—which means that insurance is about to have a major transformation, and many companies are scrambling to reevaluate their business strategies. But what happens when something goes wrong? "Liability is a poorly understood word," said Bryant Walker Smith, one of the leading experts in the legal aspects of autonomous driving. "It can refer to criminal liability (who is convicted of a felony or misdemeanor), quasi-criminal liability (who gets the speeding ticket), and civil liability (who has to pay for the harm they caused to someone else). In addition, only rarely are any of these forms of liability binary: Just because one actor is liable doesn't mean that another actor isn't."

It's important to note that although we're seeing driverless cars like Uber's taxis on the road, all of the current vehicles with this technology, available to the public, have an "operator" behind the wheel. In the case of Tesla's Autopilot, for example, the driver has all of the legal obligations and liabilities of an ordinary human driver, Smith said. SEE: Uber's self-driving car to hit the streets of Pittsburgh (ZDNet) And, to make it more complicated, different states have different rules. "Each state is regulated by a state insurance commissioner and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners," said Joe Schneider, insurance analyst at KPMG. "It's a coordinating body, but the actual regulatory environment is dictated on a state-by-state basis." In the case of an accident in Pennsylvania, which is a "soft no fault-state, the driver might have some civil liability in a crash," said Smith. "However, if they didn't act in a negligent way, they are unlikely to be criminally prosecuted." If there were an Autopilot accident, victims would likely "be much more interested in suing Tesla. Tesla would be civilly liable for the driver's actions," said Smith. "The company would also be civilly liable for any direct negligence—by, for example, deploying a system without sufficient testing." SEE: Autonomous driving levels 0 to 5: Understanding the differences (TechRepublic) Additionally, if Tesla was found to deploy a system that is unsafe, it could potentially be held criminally liable, Smith said. And as we approach full-autonomy, the burden of liability will likely shift completely to the software that runs it. "What you're [currently] insuring is driver risk," said Schneider. "Now we're talking about insuring the sensors and the algorithms and the software that is operating the vehicle because the person is now no longer really in charge in a fully autonomous world." Currently, Schneider said, we have private passenger auto insurance—but in the future, it will shift to product liability insurance coverage. "We're entering a whole new world of assessing who's at fault in an accident and where the ultimate liability and risk ultimately falls," he said. And, so far, there aren't many precedents. Mike Ramsey, Gartner analyst, pointed out there's currently only a single instance where we know the robot actually caused the accident, which happened when a Google prototype pulled out into a lane and hit a bus. In that case, Google was responsible. SEE: Video reveals the moment Google's self-driving car slams into a bus (ZDNet) But other situations are murkier. For instance, in the Tesla Autopilot fatality in April, the NHTSA is investigating whether Autopilot failed. But there are other considerations—the driver did not heed Tesla's instruction to remain alert, and did not apply brakes before hitting the semi-truck. Additionally, the truck driver may be at fault as well for cutting across a highway where cars were driving at fast speeds. "It's very hard to understand how they could hold Tesla responsible for doing something wrong in this case," said Ramsey. Smith thinks that states will have decide how to adapt to these changes. "Some states and developers will enact new laws to provide more clarity." The NHTSA, which had planned to unveil guidelines this summer, has pushed back its announcement—which will likely have a big impact on states and developers. "The public will play an important role in shaping both social and legal expectations for these vehicles," said Smith. "That's why companies like Uber should be publicly sharing their safety philosophies—how they define, measure, document, and monitor the reasonable safety of their vehicles now and into the future." SEE: How driverless cars will transform auto insurance and shift burden onto AI and software (TechRepublic) "Until you completely remove that human element from the front seat, it's not a black-and-white situation," said Schneider. "If you're in the back seat of the car and no one's in front of the car, when you get in an accident, it's highly improbable that it would be your fault." Ramsey sees two schools of thought when it comes to insuring driverless vehicles: "The car will be insured based on some sort of metric of a liability, or it will be a no fault insurance assigned to the vehicle." "It's kind of hard to know," Ramsey said. "What will likely happen is you'll see different insurance companies take different routes." Schneider agreed that it is unclear how insurers will respond to a driverless car ecosystem. "As a whole," he said, "the industry is not prepared for autonomous vehicles."

Andy Greenberg Security Date of Publication: 09.07.16. 09.07.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Google’s Clever Plan to Stop Aspiring ISIS Recruits Yasmin Green, Jigsaw’s head of research and development, who's leading its anti-ISIS search advertising campaign.Jigsaw Google has built a half-trillion-dollar business out of divining what people want based on a few words they type into a search field. In the process, it’s stumbled on a powerful tool for getting inside the minds of some of the least understood and most dangerous people on the Internet: potential ISIS recruits. Now one subsidiary of Google is trying not just to understand those would-be jihadis’ intentions, but to change them. Jigsaw, the Google-owned tech incubator and think tank—until recently known as Google Ideas—has been working over the past year to develop a new program it hopes can use a combination of Google’s search advertising algorithms and YouTube’s video platform to target aspiring ISIS recruits and ultimately dissuade them from joining the group’s cult of apocalyptic violence. The program, which Jigsaw calls the Redirect Method and plans to launch in a new phase this month, places advertising alongside results for any keywords and phrases that Jigsaw has determined people attracted to ISIS commonly search for. Those ads link to Arabic- and English-language YouTube channels that pull together preexisting videos Jigsaw believes can effectively undo ISIS’s brainwashing—clips like testimonials from former extremists, imams denouncing ISIS’s corruption of Islam, and surreptitiously filmed clips inside the group’s dysfunctional caliphate in Northern Syria and Iraq. “This came out of an observation that there’s a lot of online demand for ISIS material, but there are also a lot of credible organic voices online debunking their narratives,” says Yasmin Green, Jigsaw’s head of research and development. “The Redirect Method is at its heart a targeted advertising campaign: Let’s take these individuals who are vulnerable to ISIS’ recruitment messaging and instead show them information that refutes it.” The results, in a pilot project Jigsaw ran early this year, were surprisingly effective: Over the course of about two months, more than 300,000 people were drawn to the anti-ISIS YouTube channels. Searchers actually clicked on Jigsaw’s three or four times more often than a typical ad campaign. Those who clicked spent more than twice as long viewing the most effective playlists than the best estimates of how long people view YouTube as a whole. And this month, along with the London-based startup Moonshot Countering Violent Extremism and the US-based Gen Next Foundation, Jigsaw plans to relaunch the program in a second phase that will focus its method on North American extremists, applying the method to both potential ISIS recruits and violent white supremacists. An Antidote to Extremism’s Infection While tech firms have been struggling for years to find countermeasures to extremist content, ISIS’ digital propaganda machine has set a new standard for aggressive online recruitment. Twitter has banned hundreds of thousands of accounts only to see them arise again—many migrating to the more private service Telegram—while other services like YouTube and Facebook have fought an endless war of content removal to keep the group’s vile beheading and immolation videos offline. But attempts to intercept the disaffected young Muslims attracted to that propaganda and offer them a counternarrative—actual protection against the group’s siren song—have mostly amounted to public service announcements. Those PSA series have included the U.S. State Department’s campaign called Think Again, Turn Away and the blunt messaging of the cartoon series Average Mohammed. Those campaigns are likely only effective for dissuading the audience least indoctrinated by ISIS’s messages, argues Green, who’s interviewed jailed ISIS recruits in Britain and defectors in an Iraqi prison. “Further down the funnel are the people who are sympathetic, maybe ideologically committed, maybe even already in the caliphate,” says Green. “That’s Jigsaw’s focus.” To capture the people already drawn into ISIS’ orbit, Jigsaw took a less direct approach. Rather than create anti-ISIS messages, the team curates them from YouTube. “We thought, what if the content exists already?” says Green. “We knew if it wasn’t created explicitly for this purpose, it would be more authentic and therefore more compelling.” Testing the Theory Jigsaw and two partners on the pilot project, Moonshot CVE and the Lebanese firm Quantum Communications, assembled two playlists of videos they found in both Arabic and English, ranging from moderate Muslim clerics pointing out ISIS’s hypocrisy to footage of long food lines in the ISIS’s Syrian stronghold Raqqa. Another video in Jigsaw’s playlist shows an elderly woman excoriating members of ISIS and quoting the Koran to them: Jigsaw chose more than 1,700 keywords that triggered ads leading to their anti-ISIS playlists. Green and her team focused on terms they believed the most committed ISIS recruits would search for: names of waypoints on travel routes to ISIS territory, phrases like “Fatwa [edict] for jihad in Syria” and names of extremist leaders who had preached ISIS recruitment. The actual text of the search ads, however, took a light-touch approach, with phrases like “Is ISIS Legitimate?” or “Want to Join ISIS?” rather than explicit anti-ISIS messages. Measuring the actual effects of the campaign in dissuading ISIS recruits isn’t easy. But Jigsaw and its partners found that they at least captured searchers’ attention. The clickthrough rates on some of the ads were more than 9 percent, they say, compared with averages around 2 or 3 percent in the average Google keyword advertising campaign. They also discovered that the hundreds of thousands of searchers spent a total of half a million minutes watching the videos they collected, with the most effective videos getting as much as 8 minutes and 20 seconds average viewing time. But Could It Work? Jigsaw’s program is far from a comprehensive solution to ISIS’s online recruitment, says Humera Khan, the executive director of the Islamic deradicalization group Muflehun. She points out that both Google and Facebook have trained anti-extremism non-profits in the past on how to use their keyword advertising, though perhaps without the deep involvement in targeting, curating and promoting video Jigsaw is trying. More importantly, she argues, attracting ISIS sympathizers to a video playlist is only the first step. “If they can hook people in, can they keep them coming back with new and relevant content? That’ll be important,” says Khan. Eventually, any successful deradicalization effort also needs human interaction, too, and a supportive community backing up the person’s decision to turn away from extremism. “This sounds like a good piece of the solution. But it’s not all of it.” From a national security perspective, Jigsaw’s work raises another glaring question: Why not target would-be ISIS recruits for surveillance and even arrest instead? After all, intercepting ISIS sympathizers could not only rescue those recruits themselves, but the future victims of their violence in terrorist attacks or genocidal massacres in ISIS’s bloody sphere of influence. On that question, Jigsaw’s Green answers carefully that “social media platforms including YouTube have a responsibility to cooperate [with] the governments’ lawful requests, and there are processes in place to do that.” Translation? Google likely already helps get some of these people arrested. The company, after all, handed over some data in 64 percent of the more than 40,000 government requests for its users’ data in the second half of last year. But Green says that the Redirect Method, beyond guiding ISIS admirers to its videos, doesn’t seek to track them further or identify them, and isn’t designed to lead to arrests or surveillance, so much as education.  “These are people making decisions based on partial, bad information,” says Green. “We can affect the problem of foreign fighters joining the Islamic State by arming individuals with more and better information.” She describes the campaign’s work as a kind of extension of Google’s core mission “to make the world’s information accessible and useful.” Perhaps one of world’s most dangerous problems of ignorance and indoctrination can be solved in part by doing what Google does best: Helping people find what they most need to see.

It is also pretty handy when you want to shop for certain things, and recently in a bid to help make shopping for clothes a bit easier, Google has launched a new search feature called “shop the look”. According to Google, “Let’s say you’re looking for a new outfit to wear to a wedding. If you search for “cocktail attire”, you could see an image of a popular fashion blogger wearing a black cocktail dress, heels and sunglasses. You can shop those exact (or visually similar) products featured in the image by tapping through and exploring the relevant products shown in the form of Shopping ads.” What this means is that users will now be able to save time in searching for outfits online as it should be able to be displayed within the search results itself, as opposed to users having to scan through various websites or different apps to look for what they want. Granted this feature seems to be more catered towards advertisers as a potential platform to advertise their clothes, but it does seem to be pretty useful for folks looking for that particular outfit. As it stands, this feature is only available on mobile and in the US, but given that this new feature is currently undergoing testing, we guess it makes sense for Google to limit their audience for now.

Now you get more details on the problem If you don't know why your site has been classed a security risk by Google, more help is now available in Google's Search Console. By Liam Tung | September 7, 2016 -- 11:27 GMT (04:27 PDT) | Topic: Security Google's Search Console now provides more help to recover from site hijacking attacks. Image: Google Google is providing more helpful information for site owners to understand why their site has been labeled in browsers and search results with malware warnings. The new help resources have rolled out in an update to Search Console, the tool that site operators can use to understand how Google search sees their site, including when Google's Safe Browsing anti-malware platform detects that a site has been hijacked to spread malware. If Google Safe Browsing does detect a security issue, such as a script that redirects visitors to a malicious web page, Chrome, Firefox and Safari may display a security warning advising users against visiting the site. The warnings, which also appear in Search results, will persist until the site owner fixes the problem. Once the problem is resolved, site owners can use Search Console to request a review to have the Safe Browsing warning removed. Now site owners will have more specific information in Search Console's Security Issues report, explaining what the security problem is and how to resolve it. The more detailed accounts are available for instances involving malware, deceptive pages, harmful downloads, and uncommon downloads. The updated security issues section also offers "tailored recommendations for each type of issue, including sample URLs that webmasters can check to identify the source of the issue, as well as specific remediation actions that they can take to resolve the issue." Google is encouraging site owners to register their site in Search Console, which the company uses to send notifications about security issues it detects. Since April, Google's Safe Browsing has issued just under 60,000 browser warnings per week and between 30,000 to 40,000 malware warnings in search, according to Google's Transparency Report. It also issues warnings over phishing sites and unwanted software. The more detailed explanations may address some of the findings uncovered in a study last year by Google and the University of California, Berkeley, which looked at nearly 800,000 sites flagged for malware by Safe Browsing. The study explored the best way to communicate issues with site operators, and found significantly higher recovery rates among sites registered with Search Console because they receive notifications from Google, compared with sites alerted via browser and search warnings alone. However, the study also found 12 percent of sites were hijacked against within 30 days, suggesting some site owners weren't addressing the root cause of the hijacking. The risk for site owners is that persistent malware warnings can drive away traffic. About half the hijacked sites in the study were running on popular content-management systems, such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and VBullletin. Outdated instances of these platforms have been behind several large breaches over the past decade.

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. 17 Google products that bombed, died, or disappeared Avery Hartmans Sep. 7, 2016, 7:00 AM 321,174 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.Ben Margot/AP Images Google is known for its collection of wildly popular products, from search to maps to Android. But not everything the company touches turns to gold. Google Glass was supposed to change the world, but it quickly became a punch line. Remember Google Buzz? Of course the best innovations are the ones that everybody thinks are doomed to fail. So it makes sense that Google has had its fair share of misses over the years. How many products have ended up in the Google graveyard? We counted 17, but there are probably more (let us know in the comments section below). Here's a look at some of Google's biggest misses: View As: One Page Slides Google Answers was the first project Google worked on and started as an idea from Larry Page. Answers lasted for more than four years but stopped accepting questions in 2006. Google Source Lively, Google's virtual worlds, lasted a little over a year. Google said it created Lively because it "wanted users to be able to interact with their friends and express themselves online in new ways," but it just didn't catch on. Lively was shut down in 2008. Flickr/Dave White Source Google first unveiled Glass in dramatic fashion in 2012, but the device never made it to the masses. Glass came with a high price tag, software issues, potential privacy problems, and it generally looked too nerdy. Google ended consumer sales of Glass in January 2015, but it continues to sell the device to businesses and is working on a new version. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Source Google Buzz was a social-networking service that was integrated into Gmail, but it was plagued with problematic privacy issues and never caught on. The company announced in October 2011 it would shut down the service to focus on Google+ instead. Flickr/Rick Turoczy Source The Google Play edition Android phone was introduced in the spring of 2014. But by January 2015, they were listed as "no longer available for sale" and a Galaxy S5 edition of the phone never materialized, despite leaked photos appearing online. Google Source Google Wave was designed to let people message each other and edit documents together, but users were confused by it and it quickly flopped. Wave lasted about a year before it was killed in August 2010. Flickr/Harto Pönkä Source Google Video was Google's own video-streaming service, launched before the company bought YouTube in 2006. Google Video stopped accepting new uploads in 2009, but Video and Youtube coexisted until August 2012 when Google shut down Video for good. Source Google's Nexus Q, a streaming media player that was designed to connect all home devices, was unveiled with great fanfare at the company's 2012 developer conference. Reviews of the $299 Q in tech blogs were brutal, and Google shelved the product before it ever went for sale to the public. Steve Kovach, Business Insider Source Google X, an alternative interface for the search engine, lasted exactly one day before Google pulled the plug. A strange tribute to Mac OS X's dock, the site said: "Roses are red. Violets are blue. OS X rocks. Homage to you." Google X was quickly taken offline on March 16, 2005, and today the name has been repurposed as Google's research division. Screenshot Source Originally intended to give people access to health and wellness information, Google Health was closed for good in January 2012 after Google observed the service was "not having the broad impact that we hoped it would." Joe Raedle/Getty Images Source Google Reader was a news-reading app that let users pull in stories from blogs or news sites. Google announced it was shutting down Reader in March 2013 — much to users' dismay and outrage — and it was officially killed in July 2013. screenshot/Julie Zeveloff Source Google Catalogs, an interactive shopping program that digitized catalogs, was shut down in 2015. Google shuttered the mobile version of Catalogs in 2013 and shut down the desktop version two years later. YouTube/Google Source Google Hangouts On Air — Google's live-streaming service — is moving to YouTube Live beginning September 2016. The service was originally created in 2012 when live streaming was catching on and was once used by President Obama and Pope Francis. Google Source Dodgeball, a service that let users check in at locations, was purchased by Google in 2005. Its founders, which included Dennis Crowley, left Google seemingly on bad terms in 2007 and Crowley went on to build a very similar service, Foursquare, two years later. Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch Source iGoogle, a personalized homepage, was shut down in 2013. Created in 2005, iGoogle allowed users to customize their homepage with widgets. Google said iGoogle wasn't needed as much anymore since apps could run on Chrome and Android.

The move is largely for security reasons: Researchers regularly find dangerous vulnerabilities in Flash. On Tuesday, porn site Pornhub said it would be ditching all Flash content from its site, opting instead for HTML5, the most recent version of the web language that offers more support for multimedia content. Since hackers have had a number of successes at compromising porn sites, it’s notable that one of the largest is taking this step, albeit when Flash is already on its last legs. “It was just a matter of time until we switched, as HTML5 is becoming the standard across platforms. Now makes the most sense as Google and Firefox are slowly pushing Flash support out of their browsers. Plus HTML5 has improved security, better power consumption and it’s faster to load,” Corey Price, vice president of Pornhub, told Motherboard in an email. “All adult sites should make the transition to HTML5. Flash is nearly dead,” he added. "Contrary to some beliefs, these top adult sites are very concerned about their security" In January, hackers took advantage of two Flash vulnerabilities to deploy malware on Windows machines, which, according to the Guardian, led Mozilla to disable Flash in its Firefox browser until users had updated to a current version. That same month, YouTube announced it would stop serving its videos via Flash for anyone using a modern browser. The attacks keep coming. In June, Adobe patched a critical vulnerability in Flash that was being exploited in the wild, after fixing other issues in March, April and May of this year as well. In July, Adobe fixed a staggering 52 vulnerabilities in Flash. At the time of writing, other porn sites including YouPorn, xHamster, and RedTube are all serving their content over Flash in a fully up-to-date Google Chrome browser. RedTube, which is an affiliate of Pornhub, is expected to make the switch in a few weeks, according to a company spokesperson. YouPorn and xHamster did not respond to a request for comment. Read More: Hacking Team's Spyware Targeted Porn Sites' Visitors “Support for new technologies is critical to stay ahead of the competition but also to keep up with new performance and security standards imposed by web browsers,” Jérôme Segura, lead malware intelligence analyst at cybersecurity company Malwarebytes, told Motherboard in a Twitter message. “The Flash Player is very much like Windows XP in that its lifespan was extended way past its prime.” “Contrary to some beliefs, these top adult sites are very concerned about their security and spend considerable resources to keep malicious ads (malvertising) out and also invest in proactive research to secure their infrastructure,” he added. Pornhub was only serving Flash to a minority of its visitors. According to Pornhub spokesperson Chris Jackson, 70 percent of the company's traffic comes from mobile. However, Price said that, “This transition will affect close to 20 million daily visitors”—so still a relatively large number of users. “We expect the transition to be seamless for our users. Our new player has been tested for several months on numerous browsers and platforms,” he said. Want more Motherboard in your life? Then sign up for our daily newsletter.

Here are five more examples: [https://crt.sh/?id=30741722 1], [https://crt.sh/?id=30741724 2], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773614 3], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773616 4], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773644 5]. + These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent.     − Of those 62, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated) but where the SCT date is nevertheless before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating does not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks.   + Firstly, note that the above certs all have the same notAfter date, which is not exactly 1 year (or any other standard time period) after the notBefore. And the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) If we look for other certs matching this pattern, we find a total of 62 certificates in crt.sh and other sources.

If you order all certs in WoSign's log by ID, up to [https://crt.sh/?q=6d8665951cf6d8743200393a1085e0f6eb226270cc1f1402507d61faae93256a ID 109149], where the notBefore is on December 31st, the notBefore values are (approximately) chronologically ordered. Those which have embedded SCTs have timestamps which are about 2 hours later than the notBefore date. But after that follow 64 certificates which are all dated on December 20, 2015 (CST, UTC+8). This suggests that these were logged at the actual time of issuance but that time is not reflected in their notBefore date - i.e. they were backdated. And it further suggests that this behaviour only began after December 31st 2015, i.e. it was not a continuation of some previous behaviour.   +     + Thirdly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a [https://crt.sh/?id=11900532 SHA-256 cert] with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the [https://crt.sh/?id=30773528 backdated SHA-1 cert]. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com ([https://crt.sh/?id=30773634 SHA-1], [https://crt.sh/?id=15425430 SHA-256]) and mail.gd.gov.cn ([https://crt.sh/?id=12356371 SHA-1], [https://crt.sh/?id=12362293 SHA-256]). (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for the information in the previous two paragraphs.)   +     + Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated) but where the SCT date is nevertheless before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating does not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks.         {| class="wikitable"   {| class="wikitable" Line 279: Line 275:   ===WoSign Response===   ===WoSign Response===     − This incident has not yet been officially drawn to the attention of WoSign. + This issue has not yet been officially drawn to the attention of WoSign.     − == Incident T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016)== + == Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016)==       A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain.

"Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers. (It is not clear if these were all the same number, or in pairs, or some other combination.) This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. However, they have misclassified at least one - line 2 of Figure 14 - so the actual split may be different. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which may violate section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is unknown but probably at least 60. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, note that the above certs all have the same notAfter date, which is not exactly 1 year (or any other standard time period) after the notBefore. And the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) If we look for other certs matching this pattern, we find a total of 62 certificates in crt.sh and other sources. Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, the ID of certificates in WoSign's CT log can be used to show the logging sequence of a set of certificates even if they don't have embedded SCTs, because the IDs are sequential. If you order all certs in WoSign's log by ID, up to ID 109149, where the notBefore is on December 31st, the notBefore values are (approximately) chronologically ordered. Those which have embedded SCTs have timestamps which are about 2 hours later than the notBefore date. But after that follow 64 certificates which are all dated on December 20, 2015 (CST, UTC+8). This suggests that these were logged at the actual time of issuance but that time is not reflected in their notBefore date - i.e. they were backdated. And it further suggests that this behaviour only began after December 31st 2015, i.e. it was not a continuation of some previous behaviour. Thirdly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for the information in the previous two paragraphs.) Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated) but where the SCT date is nevertheless before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating does not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. WoSign Response This issue has not yet been officially drawn to the attention of WoSign. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. Using the value "1" led to a certificate which had a notBefore date (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which was signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. (XXX To investigate: did the chain contain some SHA-256 certs?) The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open.

A subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., Google is part of the six-member FASTER Consortium that began operating the world's fastest undersea cable to date in June this year between the US and Japan, Xinhua news agency reported. Yan Tang, Google Network Resource's Asia-Pacific regional head, posted a blog saying the company based in Mountain View, California, further extended the Trans-Pacific link from Japan to China's Taiwan province, where Google has its largest data centre in Asia. At speeds of up to 26 terabits per second, "this new cable should help Google products and services load more quickly across the region", Tang noted, adding that the experience should also be more reliable, as the cable was built outside of tsunami zones to help prevent network outages related to natural disasters. In addition to Google, China Mobile International, China Telecom Global, Global Transit of Malaysia, KDDI of Japan and SingTel of Singapore are members of the FASTER Consortium. Built with about $300 million and 100Gb/s x 100 wavelengths optical transmission technologies, the 6-fiber-pair cable system lands at Bandon, Oregon, in the US and Chikura and Shima in Japan. It reaches major data communications hubs on the US West Coast covering the Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle areas and connects many cable systems in Asian countries and regions neighbouring Japan. --IANS ksk/dg (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

This youngster from Chennai had, during his earlier stint as Director of Survey and Land Records, Kerala Government, initiated a project which involved mapping of all government offices in the State. “I shared the idea with six students from the College of Engineering in Thiruvananthapuram. We decided to use Google maps ( as it is available on every one's smart phone) to pin the location, capture a picture (of the office) and incorporate other details such as the phone number of the office. “Within eight weeks, these students mapped 500 offices,” Mir Mohammed, told BusinessLine on the sidelines of an event organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, Coimbatore. In January 2016, Mir Mohammed approached six different colleges in Thiruvananthapuram and sought the students support to get more places mapped. “The students were given four weeks. There was no support from anywhere, not even data support. Some with a firm conviction went around, mapped 1,800 places and brought them on to Google maps. The Kerala Government recognised their effort, decided to make it official by issuing an order recommending state-wide implementation of the project titled “Map My Home”. “It was a pilot and the participation of students from the six colleges became a policy,” the 46th Collector of Kannur recalled. At that juncture, with the idea of scaling up the project, he says he got in touch with Google and the initiative took off. “This time, the idea was floated to 18 colleges including arts and science institutions and the period was curtailed to 20 days – between July 25 and August 15, this year. As the initiative was supported by Google, the students were given mobile data. The result was amazing. About 3,000 students worked in teams and brought 57,000 places to the mapping platform,” he said. “What’s more interesting about this entire exercise is that all these places are now on a public platform and when people visit any of these offices and review their experience - be it critical or positive - we are able to follow the trend, the pattern. It helps us understand the ground level issues better,” he said in reply to a query. Explaining how the students went about this exercise, he said “they would first map an auto stand in that area/ locality, and with the support and help of the auto driver go around that locality, take pictures of places of public interest and upload them on to the online platform”. “There is still much to be done,” he said when asked how many more locations remained yet unmapped. The initiative has drawn a good number of youngsters within its fold.

Photograph: Lee Jin-man/AP Samuel Gibbs Wednesday 7 September 2016 04.58 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 7 September 2016 05.46 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 2 months old LG has unveiled the first new smartphone, the V20, to come with Google’s latest version of Android 7 Nougat. The South Korean firm, which was responsible for manufacturing last year’s Nexus 5X for Google and the recent modular G5, hopes that shipping with Nougat onboard will be enough to tempt buyers away from Samsung’s high-profile Galaxy Note 7. The Samsung phablet runs last year’s Android 6 Marshmallow and recalls have been prompted by exploding batteries. The new top-end Android smartphone comes with a standard 5.7in quad HD LCD screen on the front, but also has a smaller always-on “ticker” display just above it alongside the front-facing camera. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The second-screen is positioned at the top right of the V20, showing ticker tape-like information, app icons and other bits. Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP Always-on displays have become popular, with most high-end smartphones, including those from Samsung, Motorola and Google, offering features that constantly show or slowly flash notifications and the time on the main screen. LG introduced the second-screen on last year’s V10. “The V20 was built with storytellers in mind; the visual generation,” LG mobile communications director Frank Lee said at the unveiling in San Francisco. “It was designed to celebrate the idea of unmissable moments.” The phone comes with two cameras on the back, one standard 16 megapixel camera and one wide-angle 8 megapixel camera, which are similar to that fitted to the company’s G5 smartphone. The V20 has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, similar to competitors. But it is the removable battery and a microSD card slot that put the V20 among the handful of top-end smartphones with swappable batteries – a highly desirable feature for power users. Whether the two-screen, two-camera, removable battery and “utilitarian appearance” are enough to sway buyers and revitalise LG’s falling mobile sales remains to be seen. “I don’t think this will set the world on fire,” said the Current Analysis research director Avi Greengart. “That said, if you are looking for a large phone right now, and a name brand, this could be an option.” The V20’s release comes on the eve of Apple’s unveiling of its next iPhone, which is widely speculated to come with two cameras on the back, similar to LG and Huawei’s recent smartphones.

However, note that the above certs all have the same notAfter date, which is not exactly 1 year (or any other standard time period) after the notBefore. And the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) If we look for other certs matching this pattern, we find a total of 62 certificates in crt.sh and other sources. Here are five more examples: [https://crt.sh/?id=30741722 1], [https://crt.sh/?id=30741724 2], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773614 3], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773616 4], [https://crt.sh/?id=30773644 5].   +   + Of those 62, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated) but where the SCT date is nevertheless before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating does not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks.   +   + {| class="wikitable"   + !Domain   + !notBefore   + !notAfter   + !SCT Timestamp   + |-   + |[https://crt.sh/?id=30629282 passport.huayingjuhe.com]   + |Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT   + |Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT   + |Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT   + |-   + |[https://crt.sh/?id=30629285 puxbao.com]   + |Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT   + |Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT   + |Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT   + |-   + |[https://crt.sh/?id=30629275 modai.cc]   + |Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT   + |Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT   + |Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT   + |}   +   + The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in [https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Problematic_Practices#Backdating_the_notBefore_date Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices].

If you have any questions or ideas, please add them as a new topic on the discussion page. This page lists all confirmed or suspected incidents or issues involving the CA "WoSign". It will be updated by Mozilla as more information becomes available. Please do not edit this page yourself; if you have proposed changes, email Gerv. The incidents are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion.

"Incident -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this incident does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Incident F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. Incident H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers. (It is not clear if these were all the same number, or in pairs, or some other combination.) This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Incident J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This incident was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this incident perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this incident at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Incident L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance incident did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official incident report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Incident N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance incident did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official incident report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. However, they have misclassified at least one - line 2 of Figure 14 - so the actual split may be different. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Incident P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Incident R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, in violation of section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. WoSign Response Among other comments: 2016-09-02: Richard Wang: "Please don't bind WoSign incident problem with StartCom, it is two independent company that one registered in China and one located in Israel." Further Comments As well as any issues there may be with the disclosure of the transfer of ownership, the relationship between WoSign and StartCom is also relevant when determining the scope of any sanctions. Incident S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is unknown but probably at least 50. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, note that the above certs all have the same notAfter date, which is not exactly 1 year (or any other standard time period) after the notBefore. And the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) If we look for other certs matching this pattern, we find a total of 62 certificates in crt.sh and other sources. Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Of those 62, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated) but where the SCT date is nevertheless before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating does not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. WoSign Response This incident has not yet been officially drawn to the attention of WoSign. Incident T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Incident V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Incident 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. Using the value "1" led to a certificate which had a notBefore date (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which was signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. (XXX To investigate: did the chain contain some SHA-256 certs?) The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official incident report. Further Comments This incident does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open. Cross Signing It is important background information to know which WoSign roots are cross-signed by other trusted or previously-trusted roots. The following cross-signatures are currently known: Target Source Source Owner Expiry Comments /C=CN/O=WoSign CA Limited/CN=CA 沃通根证书 /C=IL/O=StartCom Ltd./OU=Secure Digital Certificate Signing/CN=StartCom Certification Authority StartCom 2019-12-31T23:59:59Z /C=CN/O=WoSign CA Limited/CN=Certification Authority of WoSign /C=IL/O=StartCom Ltd./OU=Secure Digital Certificate Signing/CN=StartCom Certification Authority StartCom 2019-12-31T23:59:59Z /C=CN/O=WoSign CA Limited/CN=Certification Authority of WoSign G2 /C=PL/O=Unizeto Sp. z o.o./CN=Certum CA Asseco Data Systems S.A. 2020-11-02T01:01:59Z /C=CN/O=WoSign CA Limited/CN=Certification Authority of WoSign G2 /C=PL/O=Unizeto Sp. z o.o./CN=Certum CA Asseco Data Systems S.A. 2020-11-02T01:59:59Z /C=CN/O=WoSign CA Limited/CN=Certification Authority of WoSign /C=US/ST=UT/L=Salt Lake City/O=The USERTRUST Network/OU=http://www.usertrust.com/CN=UTN - DATACorp SGC Comodo 2019-06-24T19:06:30Z Rob Stradling of Comodo writes: "This cross-certificate is currently unexpired and unrevoked. However, the 'UTN - DATACorp SGC' root was removed from NSS last year. 'UTN - DATACorp SGC' was also cross-certified by the 'AddTrust External CA Root' root, but we revoked the cross-certificates in December 2015." /C=CN/O=WoSign CA Limited/CN=Certification Authority of WoSign /C=US/ST=UT/L=Salt Lake City/O=The USERTRUST Network/OU=http://www.usertrust.com/CN=UTN-USERFirst-Object Comodo 2019-07-09T18:40:36Z Rob Stradling of Comodo writes: "These two cross-certificates are currently unexpired and unrevoked. However, the 'UTN-USERFirst-Object' root is only enabled for the Code Signing trust bit in NSS. There are 2 cross-certs (currently unconstrained and unrevoked) issued by 'AddTrust External CA Root' to 'UTN-USERFirst-Object'. However, the cross-certs issued to WoSign are EKU-constrained to Code Signing/Time Stamping." Other Points of Note While not a violation of any Mozilla policy, WoSign has promised to log all certs to CT after a certain date, and yet has not yet managed to comply with the Chrome CT policy of logging to at least one Google and one non-Google log. Arguably, this speaks to competence.

Chrome 53 now gets support for Android Pay mobile payment service. With the latest update, Google adds support for the PaymentRequest web standard which brings faster checkouts with a single tap. Google says that the update brings battery improvements for your device as Chrome now uses less battery for sites that people visit the most. The latest version of Chrome for Android is 15% faster than before, claims Google. For example, Chrome for Windows lets you watch more video on sites like Vimeo, Facebook and YouTube than it did a year ago. The company claims Chrome for Mac now uses 33 percent less power for videos, images, page scrolling and more. Last month, Chrome announced that it will block all flash content from September and it will set HTML5 to default on Chrome 55 for games and videos by December.

Not only is it the first device to come preloaded with Android 7.0 Nougat and Google’s new ‘In Apps’ phone search function, it’s also the first smartphone to feature a 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC, short for digital-to-analog converter. This means for buyers with good wired headphones, audio will sound better than other smartphones currently on the market. At the unveiling event, I was able to test out audio quality both on my own Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones, and on a pair of Quincy Jones Reference Headphones Q701 that were supplied by LG to compare the V20’s audio against that of the most recent iPhone. Both were impressive, showing surprising depth and articulation. The quality of sound in my Bose headphones was the best I’ve ever experienced, and I was able to pick out little moments, like a drumstick hitting a cymbal, with more precision on the V20 than with the Apple device. I must admit, however, that it took me a considerable amount of switching between phones to really appreciate the difference. This is a feature for true audiophiles. The DAC, along with the HD Audio recorder — which promises a wider dynamic frequency range using three high AOP microphones — leads LG to call the V20 mobile’s “purest audio experience.” I put this to the test by trying out the HD Audio recorder in a room full of journalists loudly taking videos of themselves, and it fared well, all things considering. My voice was separated and pushed to forefront, while everything else was relatively muted. The V20 also boasts a premium camera with several features that could make the device a future favourite with photography enthusiasts. The dual camera setup — on both front and rear-facing cameras — allows for wide-angle photos, a benefit I didn’t know I craved until I started using it. The 5 megapixel front camera has a 120-degree lens, while the 8 megapixel and 16 megapixel rear-facing cameras have 135 degree and 75-degree lenses, respectively. The camera also has Hybrid Auto Focus, a technology created by integrating laser detection, phase detection and contrast auto focus. When taking a picture, the camera decides whether laser detection or phase detection is best, then refines with contrast auto focus. This seemed to play a part in the sheer speed with which the device focuses and snaps gorgeous auto-mode pictures. The camera also loads quickly from locked and performs exceptionally in low-light, with its f/1.9 aperture front camera and f/1.8 OIS and f/2.4 aperture rear cameras. For video, LG is touting a feature it calls Steady Record 2.0, which leverages the electronic image stabilization (EIS) 3.0 technology of the provider of its Snapdragon 820 chipset, Qualcomm. This, says LG, reduces sync latency to 50 milliseconds. The stabilization process is then further improved by digital image stabilization (DIS) in post-processing. This too works surprisingly well. After intentionally jiggling my arms around while filming, in a manner that would’ve destroyed the video quality on most any other device I’ve used recently (ZTE Axon 7, Moto G4 Plus), the video I took stayed fairly centered and stable. As mentioned above, the V20 stocks a Snapdragon 820 chipset. It also has 4GB of RAM, 64GB of ROM (expandable up to 2TB) and supports X12 LTE. All this runs on a 3,200 mAh battery, removable by popping off the rear metal casing by use of a small release button on the side. It’s a slightly awkward process, but less so than the LG G5. As for appearances, the 5.7-inch display device feels incredibly light, even at a not-insignificant 174 grams, and feels slim for its dimensions of 159.7 x 78.1 x 7.7mm. It has a circular fingerprint sensor positioned on its back. The phone’s QHD IPS 2560 x 1440 pixel quantum display is crisp and vibrant, rivalling Samsung in its immediate ‘wow’ factor. Then there’s the matter of its so-called ‘secondary display,’ the small always-on ticker that runs along the top of the phone and was also a notable aspect of its predecessor, the V10. The goal appears much the same as Samsung’s edge — a part of the phone dedicated to showing the clock and essential notifications, which never needs to be turned off, and which adds functionality when turned on by providing handy shortcuts. While I’m still not convinced at the necessity of this concept in general, I do feel it works better as a screen above the display, rather than on the side, where it can be harder to navigate. Being shipped with the brand new Nougat is an added bonus for the V20, though LG’s UX 5.0+ skin retains many of the unique and often irritating quirks of the previous version, 5.0. For instance, enabling the app drawer is a multi-step process in settings. All in all, LG’s undignified skin makes it a rather unfortunate launch partner for Nougat. Another Google innovation that made its launch on the phone is In Apps, a new search mode in the Google app that lets users find content within installed apps on their phone. It works well, turning up a wide spread of information in a timely manner. The all-metal device will be available in ‘Titan’ in Canada, though pricing and availability have not been made clear yet. What we do know is that the V20 will first be made available in Korea starting this month “followed by other regions,” and that more information will be announced in the weeks to come. Considering the specs, the device is likely to cost just as much as the LG G5, if not more. A full review of the LG V20 will be posted on MobileSyrup in the coming weeks.

This is why there’s a removable battery. Ipse Looks good indeed on paper and from the limited testing. We absolutely need LG to stay in the game and stay competitive…otherwise Apple and Samsung will have their way. birdman_36 Huawei aspires to surpass them both in five years. Crossed This phone looks amazing! I just hope if fits in my car’s center console! Can’t Fix Stupid I used a black ABS 3 to 4″ adapter I got from Home Depot. Fits in my old cupholder and holds my G4 securely from tipping over. Cost was $3. John W The specs and Sound system / camera look excellent. But i feel the actual exterior design of the phone is very boring. Still i hope it does well for LG, If they keep the price below the note i can see it doing well. Eluder Totally agree. I think the phone is ugly and boring looking. Crossed I’ve never understood why people care so much about this. You interact with the screen, that’s where your eyes look. And I’m just going to assume 90% of users have a case anyway. If the screen is gorgeous, why does anything else matter so much aesthetically? John W You are 100% correct, 90% of people put a case on it anyways but there is just something attractive about a phone that looks nice all around. Omar I don’t get it either. Unless there is some part of the design that effects holding it, or for example unnecessarily large bezels… Aside from the colours and minor design changes, most phones look pretty similar to begin with. This isn’t a “pretty” phone but it’s definitely not ugly either. Leda I know this won’t resonate with everyone, but some people just derive aesthetic enjoyment from pretty things! 🙂 I love things that are pretty, and don’t like things that aren’t. If I follow that logic in clothes, décor, etc, why not my phone? A phone can act as an accessory in addition to its basic functionality as a … phone Waqqas Khokhar You can put a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but you can still smell the wolf’s breath. Once you know, you can’t pretend it’s not there. HatInTheRing I’m confused why phones outside of the Nexus line don’t come with stock Android. Does anyone know why this is? Why do we have to deal with year long upgrade schedules. And ugly, clunky skins. Why to phone makers waste their time and energy on these skins that negatively impact experience? Even Moto X and Zs and OnePlus phones middle their hardware experience with custom skins. Why? Why don’t phone makers all offer a direct buy, stock Android option? This phone would be great if such was the case. Or I would have bought the Note 7 already. Instead I have to cross my fingers the Pixel XL is the best phone in the world and checks all my boxes. Omar I think that’s the only way they can really differentiate between each other now. There’s a standard for flagship specs now, most have the same specs with maybe a different sized battery and screen resolution. And they’re all slim rectangles for the mist part. So they have more creative control over the software of their device. I don’t know if this is still around, but I know some companies, I remember HTC being one, who released Google editions of their phones (kind of like the laptops you buy directly from Microsoft) that ran stock Android. But this was only available in the US, I think. Waqqas Khokhar Because manufacturers realize that today’s market is not just about selling specs, but more about selling experiences. E.g. Apple doesn’t sell by saying “it takes 12 megapixel photos”, it does it by saying “it takes the best photos ever.” Imagine yourself looking at a picture and saying, “Boy, I’m so happy that moment was captured so brilliantly.” It’s that kind of association that manufacturers want to instill in peoples’ minds with their products. Stevie V OEMs aren’t subordinate to Google. Also, Android was never meant to look the same across OEM s who take advantage of AOSP, which is divergent by design. Even vanilla Android is Google’s own take on Android: it’s no more pure or impure than Touchwiz or LG UX. You either like the variants, or you don’t. Not one is ideal, but many folks have a preference for which experience is their favorite. Judging by the numbers, the Galaxy experience is the most preferred. As far as the stock/Google experience goes, they only claim a small number of users: the Nexus snob specifically. That’s you, and that’s fine. But just remember: its not about Google. It’s about what OEMs can do with Android. “Be together, not the same.” SoulSinger Cool article, but the guy lost all credibility when it comes to anything audio with the sentence “my Bose headphones”. Omar Do you lose credibility for calling the author a guy when she’s clearly a woman? Lol SoulSinger Yeah probably a little lol Salinger Old school thinking. Bose QC line are excellent headphones and generally accepted as the best on the market for active noise cancelling headphones. SoulSinger Noise cancelling has its place in the market for sure, but it doesn’t go hand in hand with real high quality audio. Salinger True, but the old joke BOSE = Buy Other Sound Equipment, is not really valid any more. Bose has actually been putting out some pretty decent audio products for the past few years. They may not be on par with say the M50x, but to dismiss someone as uninformed because they have and like a set of Bose headphones is not really fair any more. FTR_Part_deux The Bose headphones are even on par with the “Quincy Jones” headphones. They’re actually AKG K701s. Anton Bruckner AKG k701s are for serious music professionals and DJS. It’s highly dubious proposition to say that the average listener of music needs a $400 set of headphones. Budrow 420 Ltd I had the chance to demo a G4 and it died in 6 months without any physical abuse. Just died. Nice device – but I wouldn’t price being equal I would take my chances with a Note 7. Can’t Fix Stupid My G4 just died. Wouldn’t turn on past a brief LG logo and is fully charged. Apparently there is a hardware defect that hasn’t been widely publicized. Some internal connection fails. This seems more common than not. Luckily it was just still in warranty. Omar Expandable storage (on top of 64GB)? Check. Removable battery? Check. High resolution screen? Check. High quality cameras? Check. High quality audio? Check. Near stock Android? Check. Large battery? Check. LG really hit it out of the park with this phone. Which is why I fear it’s going to be a $849 phone in Canada. I hope it sells good for them though. John W I agree, if the reviews come out good i think it will be a good option that will only be hampered by LG’s bootloop reputation and price. If they price it nice and low look out. Omar I don’t think it will be any cheaper than the G5 starting off. But LG seems to always have their phones on sale, at least if you buy it from Wind lol. The G5 is $649 right now (but that’s a back to school sale). thereasoner I wouldn’t mind seeing a 5″-5.2″ version of this device minus that ticker display at the top of the phone, I can’t stand that. p_lindsay $849 is basically the minimum to be expected of a flagship these days in Canada. The note 7, which is probably this phones closest competitor is $1049 HATINERDAY Love my G4. If I can I will definitely grab this. nokye Been waiting for something like this. Was debating the Axon 7 and OP3 for a long time but if Fido happens to carry this, I’m definitely buying it. Hopefully the pricing isn’t insane but also… Canada. Almost settled with the G5 just because this S4 I’m typing with right now is total crap. It’s great having growing competition within the mobile industry, it’s needed for the innovation. And it gives us choices! Stevie V Has everything I want BUT front-facing speakers. What an oversight for a multimedia-centric phone! But anyway — I’ll likely get it. Jim Thibault I really doubt this will be there first Android 7.0 device in Canada. The Pixel XL rumours say will be announced Oct 4 may get them here before this device. I worry to it has Android 7.0 at launch…. how long do you wait for 7.1 or next year 8.0 Anton Bruckner Looks like a truly innovative device that is markedly different than anything else on the market today. Will have to give this a look when its finally released in Canada. GordyDevice This could be my next phone to replace my G3. I like the camera specs. The audio specs also sound good to use with my headset. It even has an SD card and replaceable battery. V20 is my next smartphone. Lil’ Cwyin’ Cowar316 It’s great that manufacturers are taking audio quality seriously; Apple better watch out or someone will steal their dinner… RS The only thing I can fault this for is no dual sim, likely slow updates (same as all non Nexus devices) and still no word on pricing. larry harsh Where’s the back buttons? Just a bigger camera for the selfie taking narcissus. I loved my G3 & V10 but might have to reconsider LG if they plan on sticking with their new “cookie cutter” phones.

But unlike tests from Microsoft or Opera, Google only pitted its Chrome against another Chrome, one from a year in the past. Unsurprisingly, the results do show how much the Chrome browser has improved, adding a little over two hours to “identiical laptops” battery lives. When watching videos on sites like Vimeo at least. One could probably blame Microsoft for starting the pissing contest. In a blog post last June, it tried to prove that its new Microsoft Edge offers the best battery optimization of all four major browser. Opera, who before that just launched its new Battery Saver feature, was up in arms and refuted Microsoft’s claims with its own “more scientific” test. Amusingly, while those tests had no clear winner, both showed Google’s Chrome browser to be the worst in saving battery life. The search giant has so far remained silent on the matter. Until now, that is. It isn’t categorically denying its battery problems. It just doesn’t say how bad they are. Instead, it decided to focus on the improvements it managed to implement in the course of a year, showing the 2-hour difference between Chrome 46 from 2015 to the current stable Chrome 53. The one caveat to this test is that Google’s optimizations and improvements are mostly applied to sites that users visit the most, particularly video streaming sites like Vimeo, YouTube, and Facebook. Even Google itself admits that users browse more than just these sites, so they have also been trying to make those improvements across the board, from displaying images to scrolling web pages. It just doesn’t say how much has improved. Some might argue that Google’s silence on some aspects is rather telling and it intentionally doesn’t compare Chrome with other browsers because it knows it will perform dismally. Then again, most users don’t switch browsers based on battery optimizations alone and are rather set on their favorite software and extensions. They would rather hear about how their favorite browser improved rather than how it fares against others. In other Chrome news, Google has also introduced new features to the browser’s mobile version, at least on Android. Now Chrome on Android supports “seamless” payments, mostly through Android Pay.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Let the Browser Battery Wars begin By Martin Brinkmann on September 7, 2016 in Internet - Last Update:September 15, 2016 11 Remember the time when browser developers focused on JavaScript speed? This started with the release of Google Chrome, and Google's initial focus on speed. While that certainly helped, especially since organizations and companies like Mozilla or Opera had to improve their engines as well to provide users with a similar experience, it put other features such as customization or control on the backburner. The focus changed eventually, when all browsers shipped with reasonably fast JavaScript engines. The main reason for that is that while there are still differences in speed, their impact on a user's experience is minimal except for the odd web application that runs a lot better when a certain feature runs faster. Nowadays, focus seems to have switched to battery live. The past couple of months has seen Microsoft release a battery comparison that saw Edge coming in first and Chrome last, and Opera Software shipping its browser with a battery saver mode that the company claims beats other browsers. And now it is Google's time to claim that battery life in Chrome 53 has improved significantly over previous versions of the browser. Google demonstrates the improvement with a comparison video that pits Chrome 46 released in 2015 against Chrome 53 released in 2016 against each other. In that video, the device running Chrome 46 dies after 8:27 hours of playing a Vimeo video while the identical device running Chrome 53 dies after 10:39 hours or 2:12 hours longer. Google did not test Chrome 53 against other browsers.  If you remember Microsoft's tests, it did use Surface Books for the testing as well. The company's browser Edge came in first with 7:22 hours of battery time while Chrome came in last with 4:19 hours. The tests cannot be compared with each other, as different videos were used in the tests. Update: Microsoft released an update battery test that showed the improvements made in the Anniversary Update compared to the Fall 2015 update. Additionally, Microsoft compared Edge against Chrome and came to the result that Edge is more efficient than Chrome (and Opera and Firefox). The company created a new side by side comparison which Edge one against the other browsers. Closing Words It seems clear that battery time is the new battleground for browser developers, with each claiming the coveted "best in class" spot for themselves. Playing a video non-stop until the battery dies is probably not the best "real world" test that one could come up with to test battery life. Most users are probably not using their mobile devices to play videos non stop. What's missing is an independent test that pits all major browsers using default configurations against each other in real-world scenarios. While one browser may very well be more optimized than others, it is clear that all users will benefit from this new battleground eventually. Browser developers will start pushing improvements to better their software's battery life; a process that has already started. Now You: Do you care about battery life? Summary Article Name Let the Browser Battery Wars begin Description Browser developers such as Google, Microsoft or Opera have found a new battleground to compete in: battery life of their browsers.

Poor children in the back watching their videos thinking to the life of their battery instead of theirs. Reply Khidreal September 7, 2016 at 12:43 pm # I DO care about battery life, but I think they are making tests on the wrong devices... nowadays everybody - or almost - has internet on their phones and therefor they go to facebok or twitter from there. do you know how weird you feel like going on a train, with your laptop open? people staring at you like if you were some addict? they are testing browser battery efficiency on laptops, do you really think someone would buy a laptop specifically for going around visiting google or something? if the motive is to go to internet, even my old 10 year phone can do that... and still the battery will last for the entire week. why would I use a laptop to do it? that's why I think they are testing the wrong devices, laptops are vanishing, on the last 2 years I saw a lot of friends and known people selling their laptop for a relatively cheap price and buying a desktop + a tablet/smartphone - even on stores, some stores already do this: desktop + smarthphone/tablet; smatphone/tablet deals. nowadays tablets become each time more like a computer and I believe in like 10 years it won't justify to buy a laptop - I am saying crap, it already does not justifies to buy a laptop - it will be more worth buying a tablet - it's smaller, as powerful as a laptop, games, programs... only big difference is you use your finger... and it's not only me who says this, if you watch a lot of sci-fi films about the future like me, you already noticed there are no laptops, you always see desktop and tablets, most of them not even use phones, they use tablets as a phone - which is already a reality nowadays - or they use something like a smarwatch. I believe laptops will vanish during the next 10 years, and phones during next 15, traded by smartwatches or tablets. actually I know 1 person that uses a tablet instead of a phone, and I think this is the area they should be testing, not laptops, they should do this kind of improvements on their mobile platforms like android and iOS, which are the future, right now they are focusing on a "pre-dead" platform. Reply Gary D September 7, 2016 at 5:13 pm # @ Khidreal "right now they are focusing on a "pre-dead" platform" So you are saying that my Laptop is an Electronic Zombie. Should I be frightened ? How do I kill it ! :-) Reply Earl September 7, 2016 at 11:45 pm # I'm pretty sure he's saying [only?] zombies go to facebook (not a surprise, really). I don't go there myself--guess I'm not "everyone". Maybe zombies can't use real computers? Too complicated? (Meh.) Khidreal September 8, 2016 at 2:59 am # what I am saying is that laptops are not dead, but are not alive either... you are taking this like if it was like a joke or something, but think about it, how's the technology world going? what areas are companies like Nvidea, AMD or even intel focusing more on? what has the most -buy rate during the passed couple of years? things like that... clearly laptops are not the winners LOL. and when things like this happen, well, usually they just... die...vanish... that's why you have a thing called dead projects, or discontinued projects, as you may prefer. everything reaches a point it can't adapt anymore, and laptops can't do it anymore... that's why each day it passes you have smaller objects, like the creation of laptops - created because desktop PC's can't addapt to mobility. I think you are smart enough to get the point... it's like nature's evolution process: you can't adapt, your species die. that's the ultimate rule nature imposes to all forms of like, rule which is also imposed to all the things we - and other species - create. Fx0 September 7, 2016 at 1:27 pm # > This started with the release of Google Chrome, and Google's initial focus on speed. While that certainly helped, especially since organizations and companies like Mozilla or Opera had to improve their engines as well to provide users with a similar experience That sounds like Google would be the best in general wrt JavaScript performance. But, for example, asm.js is a Mozilla invention and Google had to improve their engine to provide Chrome users with a similar experience. Every browser (and JS engine) has strengths and weaknesses. Also "it put other features such as customization or control on the backburne" is misleading because the javascript engine and the frontend of a browser (where customization happens) are totally different things with different teams of developers. Reply Croatoan September 7, 2016 at 10:33 pm # It's not misleading. It means that team of developers for javascript got increase in work force while customization team got huge decrease in work force. Reply Fx0 September 8, 2016 at 4:07 pm # It's misleading because the one has nothing to do with the other. Martin Brinkmann September 8, 2016 at 4:22 pm # When Chrome started out, there was no asm.js or any other serious effort by Mozilla or Microsoft to improve JavaScript speed. Sure, they worked on that, but it was not a focus. Then came Chrome, and the focus changed quickly. Yes, nowadays things have changed but back then things were different. Chrome is arguably the browser with the least customization options out there when it started. Heck, even Internet Explorer supported things like toolbars which Google's browser did not and still does not. Their focus was on other things, and while they surely put some thought into the UI and had a dedicated team working on it, the result was a browser that gave users less customization options. Many users seem to like it, so from a marketing point of view that was probably a good decision. Reply Gary D September 7, 2016 at 1:28 pm # All these tests to prove how long a battery lasts. Duracell does exactly the same in TV adverts for torch, toy, etc., batteries. Remember that these "proofs" are written and recorded by Marketing personnel. Marketing departments are renowned for telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth about products. :-) Reply chesscanoe September 8, 2016 at 4:39 pm # I just use my clamshell phone to talk when I'm away from home.

Microsoft used a number of Surface Books side by side to compare battery life across Firefox, Edge, Chrome, and Opera, and it showed that using Chrome was really bad for your laptop battery life. Microsoft even generated notifications in Windows 10 encouraging Chrome users to switch to Edge. Google has responded with a new comparison video that also uses Surface Books to show how its latest Chrome 53 release includes much better battery life improvements than Chrome a year ago. Chrome for Windows got updated with Google's Material Design and big battery improvements over the weekend, but neither Microsoft nor Google have compared how battery life ranks between Edge and Chrome now. Google is focusing on HTML5 video battery life improvements Google claims you can get around two hours more battery life with Chrome 53 compared to Chrome 46, all while playing HTML5 video from Vimeo, Facebook, and YouTube. That appears to be the focus of Google's efforts, so it's not clear whether Chrome is using less battery life when browsing regular websites on Windows. Chrome hasn't drained battery on just Windows, though. "Chrome for Mac now uses 33 percent less power for everything from videos and images to simple page scrolling," says Google's Chris Cameron. We saw claims of better battery life from Google almost exactly a year ago with the release of Chrome 45, but little changed during regular use. Google isn't claiming it has all the issues resolved, but Chrome 53 is a good first step in the right direction toward fixing Chrome's lousy effect on laptop battery life.

By Sarmistha Acharya September 7, 2016 09:42 BST Google self-driving cars to detect police carsReuters Google's self-driving car would be able to automatically detect approaching police cars and respond to them by moving over to the side of the road, with the sensors the internet giant is creating, reveals a patent filing. Google, in a patent filing at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) spotted by The Telegraph, explains a system that can recognise flashing lights from emergency vehicles. The sensors can identify any light that is either red or blue. The technology can further identify whether any vehicle is approaching and if it needs to respond. Once Google's car determines the flashing light corresponds to a police vehicle, the autonomous car can appropriately respond by either slowing down or pulling over to the side of the road. If there is no police vehicle, then Google's car will continue to operate in normal mode. It can also detect other emergency vehicles such as ambulances through light and sound patterns. The UK driving law says drivers must park their vehicle at a safe place when police ask them to stop on the road. Rule 219 of the Highway Code Rules "Emergency and Incident Support vehicles" states "driver should look and listen for emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire engines, police and doctors using flashing blue, red or green lights and sirens or flashing headlights, or traffic officer and incident support vehicles using flashing amber lights." While several drivers have been fined for not obeying the law and driving through red light, Google's new technology could help sort out the problem. Google is at the forefront of developing driverless cars. There are other emerging players in the market. Volvo is gearing up to test its self-driving cars on the roads around London next year.

Chromebooks to Get Fingerprint Scanner, PIN Unlock Features for Better Security GO Google ports some Android security features to Chrome OS Sep 7, 2016 08:15 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google is boosting the security of its Chromebooks with new features inspired by Android devices, such as a fingerprint scanner and a PIN unlock feature that will simplify user authentication procedures without weakening security. By default, when Chrome OS users lock devices, they can unlock them by typing in their Google account password. If the user is conscious about their account's security, they're probably using a long and complex password. If a Chromebook is set to auto-lock or if the user locks their laptop on a regular basis, typing in a long password every time can get annoying pretty quickly. Google working on a fingerprint scanner According to a commit in the Chrome OS source code spotted by the reporters at Chrome Unboxed, future Chromebooks may soon feature a fingerprint scanner that would make unlocking the device much simpler, but also secure at the same time. The Chrome OS update has been spotted in Gru, the baseboard code for the upcoming line of "Kevin" Chromebooks. Fingerprint scanners are currently supported on all modern smartphones and tablets and are extremely easy to use and loved by their users. The feature is so popular and requested these days that Acer integrated a fingerprint scanner in the touchpad of its upcoming Swift 7 laptop series, so it's certainly more than just a temporary fad. Chromebooks to feature a PIN pad The second security-related update spotted in the upcoming Chrome OS source code by OMG!Chrome is the addition of a PIN pad to the lock screen that can replace the Google account password input or work beside it. Google started working on this feature in early August, and the PIN pad is already available for Chrome OS Canary and Chrome OS Developer Channel users. Just like on your phone, the PIN pad uses a four-digit code to replace your Google account password when unlocking a Chromebook.

Revision as of 00:31, 7 September 2016 THIS PAGE IS A WORKING DRAFT The page may be difficult to navigate, and some information on its subject might be incomplete and/or evolving rapidly. If you have any questions or ideas, please add them as a new topic on the discussion page. This page lists all confirmed or suspected incidents or issues involving the CA "WoSign". It will be updated by Mozilla as more information becomes available. Please do not edit this page yourself; if you have proposed changes, email Gerv. The incidents are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion.

"Incident -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this incident does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Incident F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. Incident H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers. (It is not clear if these were all the same number, or in pairs, or some other combination.) This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Incident J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This incident was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this incident perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this incident at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Incident L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance incident did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official incident report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Incident N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance incident did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official incident report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. However, they have misclassified at least one - line 2 of Figure 14 - so the actual split may be different. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Incident P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Incident R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, in violation of section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. WoSign Response Among other comments: 2016-09-02: Richard Wang: "Please don't bind WoSign incident problem with StartCom, it is two independent company that one registered in China and one located in Israel." Further Comments As well as any issues there may be with the disclosure of the transfer of ownership, the relationship between WoSign and StartCom is also relevant when determining the scope of any sanctions. Incident T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Incident V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Incident 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. Using the value "1" led to a certificate which had a notBefore date (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which was signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. (XXX To investigate: did the chain contain some SHA-256 certs?) The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official incident report. Further Comments This incident does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open. Cross Signing It is important background information to know which WoSign roots are cross-signed by other trusted or previously-trusted roots.

Other Points of Note While not a violation of any Mozilla policy, WoSign has promised to log all certs to CT after a certain date, and yet has not yet managed to comply with the Chrome CT policy of logging to at least one Google and one non-Google log. Arguably, this speaks to competence.

If you have any questions or ideas, please add them as a new topic on the discussion page. This page lists all confirmed or suspected incidents or issues involving the CA "WoSign". It will be updated by Mozilla as more information becomes available. Please do not edit this page yourself; if you have proposed changes, email Gerv. The incidents are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion. Contents 1 Incident D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) 1.1 WoSign Response 1.2 Further Comments 2 Incident F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) 2.1 WoSign Response 3 Incident H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) 3.1 WoSign Response 3.2 Further Comments 4 Incident J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) 4.1 WoSign Response 4.2 Further Comments 5 Incident L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) 5.1 WoSign Response 5.2 Further Comments 6 Incident N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) 6.1 WoSign Response 6.1.1 Bug N1 6.1.2 Bug N2 6.2 Further Comments 7 Incident P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) 7.1 WoSign Response 7.2 Further Comments 8 Incident R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) 8.1 WoSign Response 8.2 Further Comments 9 Incident T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) 9.1 WoSign Response 10 Incident V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) 10.1 WoSign Response 10.2 Further Comments 11 Other Points of Note Incident D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this incident does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Incident F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response WoSign have not yet been formally approached about this, and no response has been given yet in the thread where it was noted in m.d.s.policy. Incident H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers. (It is not clear if these were all the same number, or in pairs, or some other combination.) This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Incident J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This incident was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this incident perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this incident at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Incident L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance incident did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official incident report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Incident N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Incident 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. They reported this to WoSign, giving only the Github certificates as an example. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance incident was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance incident did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official incident report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. However, they have misclassified at least one - line 2 of Figure 14 - so the actual split may be different. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process.

WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Incident R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, in violation of section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. More details to be provided. WoSign Response Among other comments: 2016-09-02: Richard Wang: "Please don't bind WoSign incident problem with StartCom, it is two independent company that one registered in China and one located in Israel." Further Comments As well as any issues there may be with the disclosure of the transfer of ownership, the relationship between WoSign and StartCom is also relevant when determining the scope of any sanctions.

Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official incident report. Further Comments This incident does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open. Other Points of Note While not a violation of any Mozilla policy, WoSign has promised to log all certs to CT after a certain date, and yet has not yet managed to comply with the Chrome CT policy of logging to at least one Google and one non-Google log. Arguably, this speaks to competence.

Jenny Blake, co-founder of Google 's career development and mentorship program, knows a thing or two about what makes an outstanding employee. Before starting her own coaching firm, Blake helped over 1,000 people improve their careers, all while learning what traits set people up for success. In her new book "Pivot," Blake shares some of her best advice. We asked Blake which interview questions employers should ask to attract highly motivated people. Here's what she said: 1. Tell me about a time where you solved a particularly interesting problem. This question gets at problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, Blake said, which are increasingly important in today's business world. 2. What are you most excited about learning? Blake said this is a good alternative to the popular five-year question. "I don't like the question, 'Where do you see yourself in five years?'" she said. "Because things are changing too quickly, it is totally irrelevant." Instead, she recommends that employers get a sense of what a person is eager to work on and which skills they want to develop. 3. What skills or talents seem totally unrelated to your career but that you enjoy pursuing on the side? This question is another good way to figure out what people are truly passionate about. "I think this one is really interesting," she said. "I've talked with people at Google who raised chickens on the side." 4. What kind of impact are you most excited to make? People want to feel that their work is making an impact, according to Blake. "High net growth individuals want to feel challenged, collaborative and like they are able to make a positive impact within their organizations and outside of them," she writes in "Pivot." 5. When was a time things didn't go as planned, and how did you handle it? "I do think it's good to try to frame something up around how someone handles uncertainty or even mistakes," Blake said. Missteps are inevitable, so hiring people who bounce back is critical. And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

Voice Control is the Most Significant Tech Story of 2016 by 3p Contributor on Wednesday, Sep 7th, 2016 Technology Share Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) By Emma Elisse Voice recognition technology has languished at the “almost-there” stage for several decades. Now that millions of consumers are speaking to their devices and expecting to be understood with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the field seems poised to deliver on its long-awaited promise. As investment and interest pours into the industry, we may see 2016 become the year when it finally achieves maturity. Besides just understanding a few key words or phrases, like many automated telephone systems do, today’s machines are developing the ability to parse more complex voice input. Google is using its massive archive of voice information to improve its voice search performance, while rival Apple is enhancing its algorithms so its Siri software can get a better handle on what users are asking her to do. A new company called VocalZoom is developing technology to filter out background noise by using a combination of traditional microphones with an optical sensor to key in on the speaker’s facial vibrations. This will result in a more accurate representation of what speakers are actually saying. Employing voice-recognition for data security Voice recognition is finding new applications in identity verification. We’ve all heard reports of passwords being hacked, resulting in the compromising of millions of account-holders’ sensitive data. If access to a person’s account is only unlocked when that individual is speaking, many instances of unauthorized access may be averted. This is part of a shift toward using biometric information – voices, fingerprints, retinal scans and more – for the purpose of uniquely identifying customers. Barclays, a major British bank, has already deployed a voice recognition system for clients who conduct financial transactions by telephone and over the Internet. Smartphone payment apps are another area in which voice recognition may play a vital role in keeping the information of end users secure. Voice control in our homes and cars Besides being employed by websites, companies and other commercial endeavors, advancements in the automatic parsing of voice commands are being increasingly used in the home, for everything from climate control, home security and entertainment applications to ordering a delivery from Amazon. Smart home devices allow for custom-tailored performance according to the homeowner’s preferences, but they have hitherto relied on manual controls via mobile phone, panel or other hardware interface. That’s all changing now, and Amazon is at the forefront. Its Echo product allows for the control of multiple appliances via human speech in concert with the company’s Alexa virtual assistant. Thermostats, door locks, lights and more can be adjusted by the user simply by issuing voice commands. Apple offers a competing solution in the form of its Siri virtual assistant and the HomeKit interface, and Honeywell offers its own line of voice-activated thermostats. Google’s response, Google Home, is expected to debut later this year. Nevertheless, Amazon appears to be way out in front of other firms in terms of ease-of-use and compatibility with existing merchandise from third-party manufacturers. Automobile producers are eyeing the potential of voice recognition in their cars. Honda VR is already on the market, and it enables drivers to perform navigation functions, adjust climate settings and control the audio system by issuing preset voice commands. For example, one can say, “display 3-D map” or “air conditioner on,” and the vehicle will perform the necessary tasks. One possible problem is highlighted in studies conducted under the auspices of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. Researchers discovered that drivers were distracted from the road for up to 27 seconds after talking to their cars or smart devices. This won’t be an issue for the “intelligent car” project from Samsung, BMW, Panasonic and Nuance. This speech-recognition system is designed for operation in self-driving cars: Driver distraction won’t matter at all because the vehicle will possess the ability to operate itself unassisted. The future of voice-recognition technology We’re seeing the convergence of all kinds of machines – cars, phones, home appliances – toward common interfaces and easier inter-operation. The integration of voice recognition software is an important step in making electronic devices more useful and desirable. By allowing human beings to converse directly with their high-tech servants, we’ll eliminate a layer of misinterpretation and possible frustration. According to a report by Markets and Markets, the voice and speech recognition market is expected to grow from $4.17 billion in 2015 to $11.96 billion in 2022.

Join For Free Discover how to optimize your DevOps workflows with our cloud-based automated testing infrastructure, brought to you in partnership with Sauce Labs.  This is a true Serenity BDD tutorial. It focuses on open source library Serenity, which helps you to write tests, produce reports and map your automated tests to business requirements. Let’s run through the basics to clearly understand how it works and how to run and debug your tests. What is BDD? BDD stands for behavior-driven development, in which an application is specified and designed by describing how it behaves. BDD offers the ability to enlarge the pool of input and feedback to include business stakeholders and end users who may not even have software development knowledge. BDD is one of the best options for continuous integration, and the Serenity test automation library is the best option for "Java-like" implementation. So, let's assume that we have a story template: As a <person (or role)>
I want <have some feature>
so that <check feature value> In BDD, a story or feature template looks like a scenario: Given <a scene of the scenario, it is typically something that happened in the past>
When <an event, or an action; can be a person interacting with the system, or it can be an event
triggered by another system>
Then <an expected outcome, or result> This format is called Gherkin, and helps us write acceptance criteria in a natural, human-readable form. BDD example (feature file): Feature: Google search
  In order to find items
  As a generic user
  I want to be able to search with Google
  Scenario: Google search
    Given I want to search in Google
    When I search for 'Serenity BDD'
    Then I should see link to 'Serenity BDD - Automated Acceptance Testing with Style' You can use different examples in one scenario by referring to example tables. For instance, the following scenario illustrates how you can verify Google search for different words: Scenario Outline: Google search multiple
  Given I want to search in Google
  When I search for '<search_request>'
  Then I should see link to '<search_result>'
  Examples:
    | search_request | search_result |
    | Serenity BDD | Serenity BDD - Automated Acceptance Testing with Style |
    | Cucumber | Cucumber | Configuring a Project Let's create project from scratch by using Selenium framework as the core of the Serenity test automation library. Create project structure (contact Serenity for project source code) Add your feature files Create under test/resources feature file: example.feature
Feature: Google search
  In order to find items
  As a generic user
  I want to be able to search with Google

  Scenario: Google search
    Given I want to search in Google
    When I search for 'Serenity BDD'
    Then I should see link to 'Serenity BDD - Automated Acceptance Testing with Style'

  Scenario Outline: Google search multiple
    Given I want to search in Google
    When I search for '<search_request>'
    Then I should see link to '<search_result>'
    Examples:
      | search_request | search_result |
      | Serenity BDD | Serenity BDD - Automated Acceptance Testing with Style |
      | Cucumber | Cucumber | Organize the feature files in subdirectories according to the requirements. In the following directory structure we have feature definitions for several higher-level features: search and translate. Create BDD testing runner class The test runner class runs feature files. If the feature files are not in the same package as the test runner class, you also need to use the @CucumberOptions annotation to provide the root directory where the feature files and step definitions can be found. Info: File should be in package that we specified in failsafe maven plugin (com.test.serenity.runTests) GoogleSearchTests.java
@RunWith(CucumberWithSerenity.class)
@CucumberOptions(features = { "src/test/resources/features" },
glue = { "com.test.serenity.stepDefinitions" })
public class GoogleSearchTests {
} Step definitions of our testing tool Each line of the Gherkin scenario maps to a method in a Java class, known as a Step Definition. Cucumber annotations like @Given, @When, and @Then match lines in the scenario to Java methods. You should define simple regular expressions to indicate parameters that will be passed into the methods (for example: "I search for 'something'" will be "I search for '(.*)'"): GoogleSearchStepDefinitions.java
public class GoogleSearchStepDefinitions {
  @Steps
  GoogleSearchSteps googleSearchSteps;

  @Given("I want to search in Google")
  public void iWantToSearchInGoogle() throws Throwable {
    googleSearchSteps.openGoogleSearchPage();
  }
  @When("I search for '(.*)'")
  public void iSearchFor(String searchRequest) throws Throwable {
    googleSearchSteps.searchFor(searchRequest);
  }
  @Then("I should see link to '(.*)'")
  public void iShouldSeeLinkTo(String searchResult) throws Throwable {
    googleSearchSteps.verifyResult(searchResult);
  }
} Info: We use @Steps to add a layer of abstraction between the "what" and the "how" of our 
acceptance tests. Step definitions describe "what" the acceptance test is doing, in clear 
business domain language. So we say "I search for 'Serenity BDD'", not "user enters 'Serenity
BDD' into google search field and clicks on the search button". File structure for step definitions, steps, and running test classes looks like this: Steps Step Library is a Java class, with methods annotated with the @Step annotation: GoogleSearchSteps.java
public class GoogleSearchSteps {
  GoogleSearchPage searchPage;
  GoogleResultsPage resultsPage;

  @Step
  public void openGoogleSearchPage() {
    searchPage.open();
  }
  @Step
  public void searchFor(String searchRequest) {
    resultsPage = searchPage.searchFor(searchRequest);
  }
  @Step
  public void verifyResult(String searchResult) {
    List<String> results = resultsPage.getResultsList();
    Assert.assertTrue(results.contains(searchResult));
  }
} Step definitions should not be complex, and should focus on working at a single level of abstraction. Step definitions typically operate with web services, databases, or WebDriver page objects. For example, in automated web tests like this one, the step library methods do not call WebDriver directly, but they rather interact with Page Objects. Page Objects Page Objects hide the WebDriver implementation details about how elements on a page are accessed and manipulated behind simple methods. Like steps, Page Objects are reusable components that make the tests easier to understand and to maintain. After extending your page with Page Object, WebDriver instance will be injected into the current page. All you need is to implement WebDriver code that will interact with the page. For example, here is the page object for the Google search page: @DefaultUrl("https://google.com")
public class GoogleSearchPage extends PageObject {
  @FindBy(id = "lst-ib")
  private WebElement searchInputField;
  @WhenPageOpens
  public void waitUntilGoogleLogoAppears() {
    $("#hplogo").waitUntilVisible();
  }
  public GoogleResultsPage searchFor(String searchRequest) {
    element(searchInputField).clear();
    element(searchInputField).typeAndEnter(searchRequest);
    return new GoogleResultsPage(getDriver());
  }
} Info: WebDriver method open() opens page according to @DefaultUrl annotation. If @DefaultUrl is missing — WebDriver will open webdriver.base.url from property file. Note: You can use the $ method to access elements directly using CSS, id, or XPath expressions. Or you may use a member variable annotated with the @FindBy. Running and Debugging For running your test, use this Maven command: mvn clean verify   During execution you can monitor logs: For debugging, you should have your debug profile in a pom.xml file. Reports As for me, reports is the best Serenity feature. You can compile living documentation, combine features and stories in a step-by-step narrative format that includes test data and their execution screenshots. Main report page shows a wealth of information about tests: count of tests, duration of execution, failed and pending tests, etc. For example, this page illustrates the test results for our first scenario: Also, example tables can be a great way to summarize business logic: An example of report results with errors: Keep in mind that reports will show you what work has been done, and what work is in progress. Any scenario that contain steps without matching step definition methods will appear in the reports as Pending. Serenity will use a feature package structure to group and combine test results for each feature. This way, Serenity can report how well each requirement has been tested, and what requirements have not been tested: You can take a look at this project at Github.

By: Express Web Desk | Published:September 7, 2016 12:20 pm Google Doodle marks the beginning of Paralympics 2016 After a successful stint with the Rio Olympics, in which the Google Doodle team ran a spunky game of their own, the guys have come up with yet another doodle for the Paralympic Games 2016 that begins today, (Wednesday, September 7). The search engine welcomes users with an animated doodle commemorating the games for specially abled athletes. The 15th Summer Paralympics to be concluded on September 18 are taking place in Rio de Janeiro, where the Summer Olympics were held. The event that’s held in the same year as Olympics every year since 1966 is the biggest sports event for athletes with disabilities and this year, welcomes over 4,000 of them from 161 countries. The Indian contingent has 19 athletes to Rio for the Paralympics under various categories out of the 10 that include impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency, leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment. Of the 500 events organised, Indian athletes will participate in events such as club throw, javelin throw, high jump, shot put, powerlifting, etc. The event was originally designed for British World War II veterans in 1948 and has now become one of the very few events for disabled athletes to look forward to. “Today’s Doodle celebrates the opening of the 2016 Summer Paralympics and highlights the incredible feats of athleticism the participants will demonstrate in Rio,” Google said in a statement.

Rumor: Google may add a Huawei-built 7-inch tablet to its lineup this fall Nexus 6P maker Huawei is reportedly in the final stages of crafting a seven-inch slab to hit store shelves by the end of the year. Derek Walter on 07 September, 2016 02:12 0 - - - - print email Google may serve a side of tablet with the main entrée of Pixel phones this fall. According to the (usually very accurate) hardware-leaking Evan Blass a new tablet will be built by Huawei and ready by year’s end. We’re already expecting two new smartphones from HTC to be shown off in early October. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 As you can see from the tweet there isn’t a tremendous amount of detail. While 4GB of RAM sounds nice, the chipset, storage options, and price will be key in whether or not this will be a tablet worth buying. Not to mention other factors, like display quality. For example, the thickness and weight of the Pixel C make it a little hard to wield. The other factor worth noting is Google’s shift in its hardware strategy. All indications are that the company is dropping the Nexus brand and going with Pixel for its phones. The current Pixel group includes the Pixel C tablet and Chromebook Pixel 2, which was recently discontinued. Both of those devices featured top-of-the-line specs and were sold and built by Google. While for its latest phones and tablet Google may still partner with another hardware maker, there may be little visible indication that they played much of a role. As we hear more from the rumor mill, we’ll be sure to keep you updated. The story behind the story: We’ve argued before that it’s time for a new Nexus 7. The Pixel C is expensive and the current-generation Nexus 7 isn’t getting Nougat so we’re left without a solid Android tablet that isn’t infested with bloatware and other customizations. Android has a lot to offer on tablets, but the struggle has been a consistent hardware offering in comparison to the ultra-popular iPad.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

I only have one card, so when one of my domain names expired a few days later, I had to let it be until I got my replacement card. So if you’ve tried to use ResearchBuzz.org as a domain and it didn’t work, that’s why. It should be back now. Thank you. NEW RESOURCES The state of Connecticut has created an online map to find pharmacies in the state which can prescribe Naloxone. “Governor Dannel P. Malloy today announced that the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) has developed a new, interactive online map that will allow consumers to locate pharmacies across the state where pharmacists are certified to prescribe the overdose-reversing medication naloxone – commercially known as Narcan….In 2015, Governor Malloy enacted legislation to make this important medication accessible through a pharmacist prescription, and also ensuring that pharmacists are certified to provide vital information to patients about how to access drug addiction services, administer the medication, and understand the side effects associated with naloxone.” TWEAKS AND UPDATES Genealogy peeps! FindMyPast is launching a new subscription offering. “Findmypast has bundled its core US collections, as well as a number of the company’s British offerings, into one package and is offering access to the records at a much lower price than before. In fact, the price is significantly lower than those of the company’s competitors.” Google Maps has gone Pokemon. Slightly. “The good news for all you Pokemon fans out there is that it looks like Google has decided to add a new Timeline activity option in the form of ‘Catching Pokemon’, meaning that you can now log your Pokemon catching activities while you’re out and about.” USEFUL STUFF These look spiffy. From MakeUseOf: 10 Best Educational Chrome Apps for Students. “If you are in high school or college, you have probably seen the number of educational apps available on the Chrome Web Store. It can be tough to narrow it down or find the perfect tool to suit your needs. For specific subjects as well as keeping track of school assignments, grades, and tasks, these 10 Chrome apps will get you off to the right start this school year.” Google Drive got a makeover/update whatever a while ago and I hate it. I told myself I’d get used to it after a while. Nope, still hate it. Anyway, this is for all my fellow Google-Drive-Interface-Haters: How to See the Number of Files in a Google Drive Folder. AROUND THE SEARCH AND SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD Looks like OpenOffice is in trouble. “Not everyone is in a position to pay for their office software and this led to a market for free Microsoft Office competitors. One of the best known and most popular is OpenOffice, but the open source project is in trouble. Volunteer vice president Dennis E. Hamilton has warned that retirement of the project ‘is a serious possibility’. ” I switched to LibreOffice ages ago; it made OpenOffice look really clunky. SECURITY/LEGAL ISSUES The latest giant password breach is Last.fm. “The contents of a March 2012 breach of the music tracking website Last.fm have surfaced on the Internet, joining a collection of other recently leaked ‘mega-breaches’ from Tumblr, LinkedIn, and MySpace. The Last.fm breach differs from the Tumblr breach, however, in that Last.fm knew about the breach when it happened and informed users in June of 2012. But more than 43 million user accounts were exposed, including weakly encrypted passwords—96 percent of which were cracked within two hours by researchers associated with the data breach detection site LeakedSource.” Chrome has gotten a big security update. Be sure to patch! “The latest Google Chrome browser update comes with 33 vulnerability patches, including 13 that are high-severity. It’s all thanks to community contributors and bug fighters who submitted fixes for Chrome’s bug bounty program. Many of the vulnerabilities fixed in this release were part of the browser’s engine Blink, but some of the more high-severity discoveries were for Chrome’s built-in PDF reader, PDFium.” A lawsuit over Yahoo’s email privacy has been settled (for a given value of “settled”.) “Days ago, a Silicon Valley federal judge signed off (PDF) on a settlement (PDF). The lawyers won, they were awarded $4 million (£3 million), and the public got nothing. What’s more, the settlement allows Yahoo to continue to scan e-mails without non-Yahoo users’ consent. (Yahoo Mail customers have granted consent to the scanning as a condition of using the service.) The major change the lawsuit produced was that Yahoo is agreeing to scan the e-mail while it’s at rest on its servers instead of while the mail is in transit.” An in our latest episode of “IP stupidness,” Warner Brothers flags its own site as a pirate site. Read the article. Warner Brothers has done this multiple times. RESEARCH AND OPINION Good stuff from Network World: Which countries have open-source laws on the books? “… it’s become increasingly common over the past decade or so to see laws being passed to either mandate the use of open-source software or, at the very least, encourage people in government who make procurement decisions to do so. Here’s a map of the status of open-source laws around the world, via the magic of Google Fusion Tables.” Good morning, Internet… Do you like ResearchBuzz? Does it help you out?

Korea FOCUS Select Language ALL HEADLINES All Headlines (LEAD) LG Electronics unveils V20 premium smartphone 2016/09/07 14:47 Tweet Facebook Share Google +1 Reduce Enlarge Print (ATTN: ADDS quotes, details in last 6 paras) SEOUL, Sept. 7 (Yonhap) -- LG Electronics Inc. released its new V20 premium smartphone Wednesday, which features improved audio functions and dual-lens rear cameras. In collaboration with Denmark's luxury brand for stereo devices, Bang & Olufsen (B&O), the new smartphone boasts a high-end audio resolution. "In an effort to further enhance audio functions and design, LG is continuing its collaboration with B&O PLAY," the company said in a statement. "The result in the LG V20 is a natural, balanced sound, reflecting B&O PLAY's acoustic engineering philosophy," it said. By integrating a 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC (digital to analog converter) technology into the device for the first time, the V20 "delivers high-quality sound to any pair of earphones," LG said. "The Quad DAC in the V20 delivers clearer sound by minimizing distortion and ambient noise by up to 50 percent," it said. The V20 also features wide-angle lenses on the front and back of the handset. "The wide angle capabilities of the front and rear cameras capture photos with an inclusive background, meaning users get more in the frame and leave nothing out," the statement said. The front camera "with a 120-degree lens expands the selfie experience to take bigger pictures with even more friends," it said. The rear camera "with its 135-degree lens is perfect for taking pictures in front of a gorgeous vista or inside a gigantic stadium," it said. The V20 is the first smartphone in the world to run on Google's latest Android mobile operating system called "Nougat" and adopt Google's new search app "In Apps."    "The new search mode featured in the Google app, helps users find content not only from built-in apps, including contacts, emails, text messages and photos, but also from user-installed apps," the statement said. "It also enables users to discover recently accessed apps, people to get in touch with, messages to read and activity across apps without having to type a query," it said. "The LG V20 is designed to offer customers a more dynamic experience by building on the most popular video and audio features of the V series," said Juno Cho, president of LG's mobile communications division, in the statement. "With the LG V20, we are giving our customers more of everything they love and less of anything they don't need to set a new standard for premium smartphones," Cho said. LG did not disclose prices of the V20. In-store sales of the V20 are expected to begin later this month in South Korea. LG has been struggling to revive its sluggish sales of smartphones. Following disappointing sales of another premium smartphone, the G5, earlier this year, LG's handset business division posted its fifth consecutive quarterly operating loss in the second quarter. Asked when LG would report a profit in its smartphone business, Cho replied that LG's smartphone business is facing a "very difficult" situation. However, Cho voiced hope that the V20 could help LG "go forward in a good direction."    LG's V20 launch coincides with Samsung Electronics Co.'s global recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone over a battery problem. Asked whether the recall of the Note 7 would be a boon for sales of the V20, Cho replied, "I don't know whether it will be a favorable factor or not for the V20."   (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

Yan Tang, Google Network Resource's Asia-Pacific regional lead, posted a blog saying the company based in Mountain View, northern California, further extended the Trans-Pacific link from Japan to China's Taiwan province, where Google has its largest data center in Asia. At speeds of up to 26 terabits per second, "this new cable should help Google products and services load more quickly across the region," Tang noted, adding that the experience should also be more reliable, as the cable was built outside of tsunami zones to help prevent network outages related to natural disasters. In addition to Google, China Mobile International, China Telecom Global, Global Transit of Malaysia, KDDI of Japan and SingTel of Singapore are members of the FASTER Consortium. Built with about 300 million U.S. dollars and 100Gb/s x 100 wavelengths optical transmission technologies, the 6-fiber-pair cable system lands at Bandon, Oregon, in the United State and Chikura and Shima in Japan. It reaches major data communications hubs on the U.S. West Coast covering the Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle areas and connects many cable systems in Asian countries and regions neighboring Japan.

Google Responds to Microsoft with Its Own Chrome Battery Tests on Surface Books GO Google says Chrome battery life is substantially improved Sep 7, 2016 05:28 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft has recently posted benchmarks to show that its new Edge browser integrated into Windows 10 offers significantly better battery life as compared to its competitors, including here Opera, Firefox, and Google Chrome. And while Opera has already responded with its own benchmarks, Google and Mozilla preferred to remain tight-lipped and let Microsoft go on with its claims. Until today, that is. Google, who recently rolled out the new Chrome 53 with Material Design and other improvements, has posted a new video to show that this updated version of its browser comes with significant battery life tweaks over the version 46 launched one year ago. Better than Chrome 46 The search giant performed the tests on Surface Book, Microsoft’s laptop that was launched in October 2015 and that is expected to receive an upgrade as soon as this year. Microsoft previously used Surface devices for its own benchmarks too, so it’s not surprising to see Google turning to the same device series in order to highlight the battery capabilities of its new browser. “People use their browsers for more than just video. That’s why we’ve been improving battery life across the board, tracking progress using power measurement tools. As one example, Chrome for Mac now uses 33 percent less power for everything from videos and images to simple page scrolling. Whether you’re planning a vacation or getting work done, you now get more browsing time from a single battery charge,” Google explains. What’s worth mentioning, however, is that Google hasn’t performed benchmarks against other browsers, such as Microsoft’s own Edge, and we all know what Microsoft’s fanboys are going to say. But for the moment, choosing the best power-efficient browser still comes down to the most popular names on the market, which include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Mozilla Firefox. It remains to be seen if Microsoft wants to conduct a new series of benchmarks to put Edge against the latest version of Chrome, but no matter its decision, competition in this regard is getting fiercer, and the ones to benefit from it are customers.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Google breaks down security patches for Android By Martin Brinkmann on September 7, 2016 in Google Android - Last Update:September 7, 2016 31 Google published monthly security updates for Android for about a year which manufacturers get in advance to push out to their devices after integrating and testing the patches. While some manufacturers are quick to integrate new security patches, others are not so much. My Xiaomi Mi4c phone is stuck on the July patch level for instance, which means that it has not received the August nor the recently released September patches yet. Tip: you can check the patch level of your Android device in the following way: open the Settings application on your device and find the about link on the page. There you should find information about the Android security patch level. Android Central reports that Google has broken down security patches for Android this month instead of shipping all patches in a single package. Google released three patches this month for Android that fix various security related issues for all devices running the operating system. 2016-09-01 — patches for a pair of Critical remote code execution vulnerabilities, many serious Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities, several Information Disclosure vulnerabilities, and a pair of Denial of Service vulnerabilities all within Android itself. 2016-09-05 — Everything in the 2016-09-01 patch, as well as patches for several kernel related Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities, many Qualcomm driver-related vulnerabilities, and Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities found in other third-party drivers. 2016-09-06 — Everything in the 2016-09-01 and 2016-09-05 patches, as well as a fix for a Critical Elevation of Privilege vulnerability in the kernel shared memory subsystem and a fix for a vulnerability in a Qualcomm networking component. The third patch, released on September 6, includes the patches released on September 1 and 5. If it is installed, it makes the device the securest. While Google has not revealed why it changed how Android patches are provided to manufacturers, it appears that this is done for a number of reasons. First, it provides manufacturers with options to prioritize patches and deliver some to their Android user base faster. Manufacturers may pick high priority patches over others, or speed up the process of updating devices by pushing out patches individually instead of in one large package. Google too may provide manufacturers with patches faster. This becomes evident when you look at the different release dates for the September patches. The first set was released on September 1, the last on September 6. Still, with all that said, it is still up to the manufacturer of the device to push out security patches in a reasonable time frame after they become available (that is 30 days before release). Closing Words While I really like my Xiaomi Mi4c phone, I won't purchase another device from the company because of the slow release of security patches and updates to newer Android versions. The device is still stuck on Android 5.x (which it shipped with), while it is capable of running Android 7.x. Unless manufacturers change their stance on providing updates for their devices, compartmentalizing security patches won't probably have a noticeable effect on the state of Android security. Now You: What's the patch level of your Android device? Summary Article Name Google breaks down security patches for Android Description Google started to break down security patches released for its Android operating system starting September 2016.

Security is too important to choose otherwise. Reply Martin Brinkmann September 7, 2016 at 7:03 am # I'm waiting for the next two "Google" devices which should be out soon. Lets see what they bring to the table. I have to do a bit of research on other manufacturers and custom Roms to see which company is equally fast and reliable, if any. Reply Constantinos Zeniou September 7, 2016 at 8:01 am # Let us know your results Daz September 7, 2016 at 1:06 pm # I'd also be very interested in hearing about how quick each manufacturer is with security and OS releases on Android. In a month or two, I'll be likely switching to Android (from WP) and having timely updates (security and OS) is a big factor to me as well. friend September 7, 2016 at 5:20 pm # you can flash custom ROM, moreover when you have official release of CM13 available for it Xiaomi Mi4c https://www.cmxlog.com/13/cancro/ I would not buy Nexus phone as don't need latest & greatest spyware...and cheaply built phone (which nexus always is) with on screen buttons prefer clean Android on drugs, loose of any manufacturer hooks (including those from google) and left of any 'calling home' gotchas from the hand of CyanogenMod... updated Marshmallow in their hands is better that Nougat any day (privacy guard, themes, heavy optimization, gazillion fixes and many nice options etc.) just get yourself OnePlus 3 and don't believe what Samsung kids say as they are paid to storm internet forums - amazing device and CM also officially available so you don't need to run their cheap Chinese crap OS Josh Gunderson September 7, 2016 at 7:12 am # "While I really like my Xiaomi Mi4c phone, I won't purchase another device from the company because of the slow release of security patches and updates to newer Android versions." My thoughts exactly regarding my ASUS Zenphone2 (128GB), which is still on Android 5.0 and just got the August patches a few days ago. Reply Sais September 7, 2016 at 7:25 am # On my Mi4i, I have August patch. I have been rather pleased with Mi to provide updates once in a couple months or so because I didn't see other entry-mid range phones getting quicker updates. Some even get only 1-3 updates during the life time. Reply ask September 7, 2016 at 7:51 am # I'm using Nexus 5x but I haven't got the new OS yet.. This is my first Nexus phone, is it normal? Reply Anonymous September 7, 2016 at 8:36 am # You can enroll in the beta program and get Android 7 and all new patches the moment they are out. https://www.google.com/android/beta My brother's Nexus 5x is also still waiting for Android 7. Reply Dan September 7, 2016 at 8:13 am # My patch level is "1 June 2016" on my P8. What's worse, it was stuck in 5.xx until it was finally updated to 6.0 two weeks ago. Reply vosie September 7, 2016 at 8:48 am # LG V20 has been released today. This is the best phone of the world. LG is the ONLY ONE manufacturer who still make fagships with removable battery. Moreover, LG phones have the best camera. I'm glad that V20 has removable back cover instead of the unibody design of G5. This means that 3rd party battery manufacturers can make bigger, higher capacity extended batteries for LG V20. I hope those crap "seamless updates" (Windows 10 like feature) in Android 7 can be disabled or the customized Android systems that different manufacturers create for their phones (like Samsung, LG) will not have those "seamless updates" at all. Reply Martin Buckley September 7, 2016 at 9:35 am # "While I really like my Xiaomi Mi4c phone, I won't purchase another device from the company because of the slow release" this is universal IMHO, unless you go the Nexus route, Anybody care to name an OEM who issues patches, updates in a timely manner. Not being overly paranoid, ( I use gmail after all ) the prompt updating of software would not determine which pocket mate I carry Reply archie September 7, 2016 at 9:58 am # >>>>>>>this is universal IMHO, unless you go the Nexus route, Anybody care to name an OEM who issues patches, updates in a timely manner. Not being overly paranoid, ( I use gmail after all ) the prompt updating of software would not determine which pocket mate I carry >>>>>>> I used to think this way. But bigdata and Palladium happened. There is no paranoia here. We can't seem to avoid being networked with straight links to our identity, which makes flawless security mandatory. Saying unpatched android is not 100% secure, is just as correct as saying windows 95 is not. My plans for the next future seem to be to link my android phone to a shell gmail account and stop using gmail altogether. Reply archie September 7, 2016 at 9:39 am # When I bought my MOTO G LTE (late 2014), Motorola was a Google company, which was supposed to help with patches. Now, 2 years later, this perfectly good phone is stuck with Lollipop. April patch. The recent announcements of several critical security flaws in android, all versions, leaves me 100% positive that I have a 100% unsecured phone, not to be trusted with anything personal. Which is impossible, the phone being a ... phone. I just don't see a way out. And I'm not in the business of purchasing a new phone twice a year. Reply Daz September 7, 2016 at 1:13 pm # It's looking like Nexus phones are the way to go for security and updates. Nexus always come first with OTA updates from what I've seen. It'd be nice to see which of the OEM's are better than others in this area though. Reply Padraig September 7, 2016 at 10:49 am # Patching is the weak link with Android - or more correctly the devices manufacturer. I recently changed my 4 year old budget Sony Xperia and was ready to move away from Android altogether. I was able to get a Moto4G though for €169 on Amazon . At the moment it is on the May 16 patch - I'll see how it goes and that will decide me on Android. Reply riri September 7, 2016 at 11:30 am # Patch levels does not indicate that a manufacturer has included all the latest patches as shown in the documentation provided by Google. I believe manufacturers can put in whatever "patch date" they like and not implement any/all of the patches according to the patch dates details set by Google. The worse culprit is Xiaomi themselves right here: http://en.miui.com/thread-346357-1-1.html Reply Tony September 7, 2016 at 11:44 am # An overwhelming majority of Android devices in the world are vulnerable to numerous security and privacy exploits... and there are still no patches available to customers to fix those vulnerabilities. Reply Martin Brinkmann September 7, 2016 at 1:12 pm # The funny thing is, patches are available to patch those security issues, but manufacturers are slow to integrate them, if at all. Reply archie September 7, 2016 at 12:03 pm # I gave it some more thoughts, thanks to this blog post; that was useful :) I decided that the only way to keep on with android is to break ties with the manufacturer. We definitely need to be free of their abuse. That basically means picking a phone that can easily be rooted and that is supported by a major custom ROM. I have been avoiding rooting since the galaxy SII. It was too much of a hassle and brought more trouble that anything. Plus Samsung is working very hard to make the process painful and dangerous. Other brands might be better but they're all more or less guilty of the same. In my case, the MOTO G (XT1039) will soon be rooted with a custom bootloader and the stock ROM replaced with Cyanogen. I expect nightly editions to incorporate decently recent patches. I'd rather fight with unstable nightly versions and have a backup dumbphone than put up any longer with that smartphone nonsense. Reply Martin Brinkmann September 7, 2016 at 1:13 pm # Custom roms are definitely one option to stay up to date. Most manufacturers are slow when it come to shipping updates, or don't ship those updates at all. One reason for doing so, probably, is that they don't earn that much money from maintaining old products. Still, they seem to overlook that some users won't be burned twice by the same manufacturer. Reply archie September 7, 2016 at 1:46 pm # You're right, there was a paradigm shift : up to a recent point, people felt like there was a contract to keep a product up and running after purchase, this for the expected life expectancy. Not anymore it seems: critical software updates now belong in the category of unjustified expenses. It has been a few years, since I started to put up with being burned. By Microsoft, Samsung, Google, Intel, Sony, the phone company or the politician next door or in the capital. obviously, the list has no end. That means I decided to sleep on it, not that it passed unnoticed. At one point I will be done sleeping and start doing something about it, even at the cost of some pain or discomfort. I suspect many think alike, who are neither extremist or young idealists. When this category starts to take matters into their own hands, android patches will be the last of the PTB problems... DarkTheme September 7, 2016 at 12:42 pm # I will never buy an Android. device Google and your partners rarely update your appliances leaving no bug fixes and several security vulnerabilities. Reply CHEF-KOCH September 7, 2016 at 1:33 pm # This is not new, in about you find 'Security or 'Patch' level since 1 year - started with MM. It's also in CM 13. The thing is that this is useless since you can't click on it to get additional infos or a normal user can't ensure he uses latest versions since you need to do manually research then, which makes it pointless. Custom Roms are okay as long you choose one which regularly gets updates like CM or any other ROM which are not dropped after 4 months. The important chain is also not the ROM here, more the user and his interests to keep it updated or not. You can't force users to update and this is (imho) more dangerous. Imho the ISP should offer a feature to ensure you device gets checked for updates, so that you also get an sms or notification about this. This maybe would help against a lot of malware (of course again the user must agree and install this update). Reply Bobo September 7, 2016 at 3:25 pm # Moto G 3d gen. (2015) Android 6.0.1 patched March 1. I bought this thing because it was advertised everywhere that it will get the latest Android updates blaaaa blaaaa..sure it did get Marshmallow eventually, faster than most I think, but it seems it just gets the OS and then they leave it at that. Oh and updating from 5 to 6 wiped my contacts from my SIM card so I had nothing left, that was a nice bonus..plus the 6 update totally screwed up my SD card storage, can't access anything on the card via phoneattachedtopcwithcable, the phones internal file manager sees all files fine.. So yeah updating is JOLLY GOOD FUN TOO ! Hopefully things change when N comes along, but I have my doubts. Time to look for a new clean updated Android for me then..BLEHHH.. Reply archie September 7, 2016 at 4:14 pm # A "new, updated" android phone will make you jump through hoops just the same. I believe it is time to take a firm stance on boycott towards manufacturers who lock their phone or even organize the slightest obstacle to free bootloaders, rooting or stock android support. As it always was, the way to go is free software, which android is. If and when it is not anymore, then some free alternative will have to take its place. In the meantime, if a device offers less than transparent android support, i.e if its manufacturer blocks drivers or specs release, making custom ROM's difficult, that should be enough reason to look somewhere else. This certainly will be my first criteria from now on when buying a phone. I will walk away from every manufacturer that shows the slightest reluctance at advertising full phone specs, allowing free software support. Just like I started boycotting Sony after the rootkit affair, I will start boycotting every company that keeps on pushing towards closed source and proprietary: this is the next big threat to our society. Reply A or B, not C. September 8, 2016 at 4:48 am # @ archie ....... U can give Sailfish OS smartphones a try. Not sure whether the OS gets regular security updates. Sailfish OS can use Android apps. Var September 7, 2016 at 4:12 pm # "While I really like my Xiaomi Mi4c phone, I won't purchase another device from the company because of the slow release of security patches and updates to newer Android versions." ___________________ You are being overly dramatic with this. There isn't a Android OEM on the planet which is even close to Xiaomi in regards to OS Update cycle. NONE. They are supporting their budget devices from 3 years back and high-end devices from 4 years back, with Software base parity compared to devices launched weeks/months ago. NOT A SINGLE OEM does this. As for Sept updates, they have already been outed for many Xiaomi devices, it just so happens that sometimes this update cycle for Xiaomi is staggered across devices. In fact many times Xiaomi's security release cycle is faster than even Nexus devices which is insane. https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4yj5bh/latest_miui_update_adds_september_security_patch/ If someone treats Security Updates as a non-negotiable pre-requite and deal breaker in buying a phone, there is only 1 option for these people, get a Nexus, Period. Otherwise to treat other OEM's into a flawed ranking is being disingenuous because Xiaomi is one company which actually does this the best. Moto in fact has given up all together on this. Samsung doesn't update their 4 year old devices. Same with Sony, HTC and LG. Reply Croatoan September 7, 2016 at 10:27 pm # I am from Croatia. I would like to buy a Nexus phone. Where to buy it and get a waranty. Reply Xircal September 13, 2016 at 6:10 pm # Nexus phones won't become available in Croatia until Google open a Play Store there I'm afraid. You might be able to buy one online from another country, but the warranty will only be valid in that country, not in Croatia. Reply Xircal September 13, 2016 at 6:04 pm # Don't buy any Motorola phones. The company refuses to release monthly security updates. My own phone is still stuck on 1 January 2016. Arstechnica has an article on the subject: http://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2016/07/motorola-moto-g-z-monthly-updates/ Motorola was acquired from Google - who were only interested in their patents - by Lenovo so it's not as if they're running out of cash.

New Android Security Patch Level System Is a Convoluted Mess GO Google uses 3 security patch levels in September's bulletin Sep 7, 2016 04:10 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google has released today the September edition of the Android Security Bulletin, which, starting this month, features a new three-level patching string system that is extremely confusing, even for Android professionals. The "Android security patch level" string is a setting in the phone's "About" section that tells you the date of the last security update your phone received. Google introduced this string when it started delivering scheduled monthly updates last August. In May 2016, the company renamed the Nexus Security Bulletin to the Android Security Bulletin to reflect that some of the fixes addressed all Android devices, not just its own. In July 2015, the company split the bulletin in two, with one section addressing security fixes in core Android files while the second containing fixes in device-specific drivers and components. As such, the bulletin featured, for the first time, two security patch levels. September security bulletin fixes 54 security issues For this month, lo and behold, the Android Security Bulletin now has three security patch levels that for sure will confuse users. There's the "2016-09-01" security patch level that includes core security updates for the Android OS. There's the "2016-09-05" security patch level indicating that a device has received security updates for core files and device-specific drivers. And there's "2016-09-06," which indicates the phone includes security updates for core files, device-specific drivers, and... we don't know. For this month, the third security patch level includes two bug fixes, one for a critical update for an Android core-related issue, and for a Qualcomm networking component. Doesn't really make sense that much. Remember, this was the same company that was cited saying it would start shaming OEMs for failing to implement security fixes. Well, Google isn't making their life easier. Below is the screenshot of an Android device's security patch level string, and all the security fixes included in this month's security bulletin.

The publisher said the new site, based on Google technology called Progressive Web Apps, will load mobile webpages in under a second, compared with around three seconds for its current mobile site. “Our goal was to create the fastest mobile news site possible,” said Shailesh Prakash, chief technology officer for the Post. “A lot of publishers have spent time making their apps very fast, but the mobile web is where the growth is. It’s where the action is.” Mr. Prakash said 70% of the Post’s traffic now comes from mobile devices. The mobile website is used far more frequently than the Post’s app, with 63% of overall traffic using its mobile website specifically and 7% on the app. Many online publishers are attempting to speed up their website loading times, both for mobile and desktop devices. As consumers access more content on mobile devices, and often from cellular data connections, mobile site speed is increasingly seen as an important differentiator. Companies such as Google and Facebook are also pushing publishers to speed up their sites to keep consumers from growing impatient and navigating elsewhere. In early tests, users accessed five times more pages on the new version of the Post’s site than they did on the current version, Mr. Prakash said. The PWA technology powering the new site is an open-source set of technology standards formulated by Google’s Chrome team, which are also responsible for its popular Chrome web browser. At a basic level, the PWA technology works by pre-loading content on users’ devices in the background to ensure it’s ready to display quickly as they move around the site. In order to use PWA, websites must use a secure web technology known as “HTTPS,” which the Post began implementing last year. Beginning Thursday, around 10% of mobile traffic to article pages will be directed to the new “PWA” version of the Post’s site. By the end of the year, it plans to have switched over to the new version entirely. More on the Washington Post Bezos Takes Hands-On Role at Washington Post Washington Post Looks to Publishing Platform as Growing Revenue Stream Washington Post Pushes Into Ad Tech With New High-Speed Ad Product According to Jed Hartman, the Post’s chief revenue officer, no significant compromises were made with the new site with regards to advertising. The company’s engineers figured out a way to ensure ads don’t slow down the experience significantly, he said, and Post advertisers should not need to do anything differently on their end. For the Post, the move is emblematic of a larger philosophy being employed by the publisher, which was purchased by Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos in 2013. The company has made significant investments in publishing technology and tools over the past few years, and pursued an aggressive “platform publishing” strategy through which it posts content to services such as Facebook and Apple’s News app. Mr. Bezos has notably previously communicated with Washington Post executives about the importance of speed as it relates to the Post’s mobile experiences. For Google, the PWA project is one of a handful of initiatives it’s working on in an attempt to improve the performance of the mobile web, on which it relies to help generate revenue for its various online advertising products. The company’s search team has been working on a project called Accelerated Mobile Pages that many publishers have adopted to help load their content more quickly by stripping out code from their pages, for example. Those pages are often linked to from within Google search results. The Post is using AMP technology also. If a user taps a link to a Post article in Google search results, they will be served up an AMP version of the content, Mr. Prakash said. But if they subsequently tap a link in that article to move to another Post article, they will be directed to the PWA version of its site. “At Google we are working hard to improve the way the web works today and build a better web for the future. As a result we are seeing a brand new era of web development that is leading to an explosion of innovation with technologies like AMP and PWA,” said Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, vice president of product management for Google Chrome.

By: AP | Published:September 7, 2016 9:46 am LG V20 smartphone with Android 7.0 Nougat has been unveiled and also comes with dual-rear cameras. (Source: AP) LG is unveiling the first phone to ship with Google’s new Android Nougat software, in hopes of appealing to people who like to take and share photos and video. The new V20 phone comes on the eve of a San Francisco event where Apple is expected to launch new iPhones. Nougat is already available as a free upgrade on some Google phones under the Nexus brand. The V20 would be the first with Nougat already installed. Other phones aren’t likely to get Nougat for a while because individual phone makers and wireless carriers have to tweak and test the new software first. Many of the Android improvements in Nougat are “under the hood” and thus largely invisible, such as tweaks to reduce battery consumption and cellular data use. The most obvious changes include the ability to run two apps side by side, something Samsung and LG have offered on their phones on a limited basis. Nougat will also let people reply to messages within notifications, something Apple already offers on iPhones. Meanwhile, the V20 promises higher-quality audio playback and recording, with reduced background noise, according to LG. The company also says it also improved image stabilization when recording video. LG spokesman Frank Lee described the V20’s target audience as “storytellers.” Twinkle Khanna: Being A Feminist Equated With Being A Satanist Or A Justin Bieber Fan Twinkle Khanna Tests Karan Johar’s General Knowledge & He Is Stumped John Abraham And Sonakshi Sinha Explain How Force 2 Has Some Never-Seen-Before Action 5 Resons To Watch Force 2 Trouble Mounts For Former IPL Chairman Lalit Modi: Here’s How Demonetisation: Banks Use Indelible Ink On Cash Exchanger’s Finger Assam: 1 Killed, 2 Injured As Suspected Militants Attack Cash Van Sheena Bora Murder: Bombay High Court Rejects Peter Mukherjea’s Bail Plea Demonetisation: Farmers Hit Hardest By The Cash Crunch TMC, Shiv Sena, NC Join Protest March Against Demonetisation Demonetisation: Piyush Goyal Says ‘Honest Has Been Honoured’; Anand Sharma Criticizes, Says Rs 2000 Note Reminds Him Of ‘Churan Ki Pudiya’ External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj Undergoes Dialysis At AIIMS Relief For Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi: Find Out More Bigg Boss 10 Nov 15 Review: Why Gaurav Chopra Is Hesitant To Take A Stand?

Unlike many other top-line phones, the V20 features a replaceable battery. The V20 is expected in South Korea this month, with other markets, including the U.S., to follow. LG didn’t immediately announce prices. Apple also plans to update its phone software this month. The update, iOS 10, will come with new messanging and photo features and more detailed notifications on the lock screen. Existing iPhone users will be encouraged to upgrade for the software for free. New iPhones expected to be unveiled Wednesday will come with iOS 10.

The V20 boasts new features including Steady Record 2.0, Hi-Fi Quad DAC, HD Audio Recorder and front and rear wide-angle lens cameras to deliver incredible performance. It is also the world's first smartphone to come preloaded with Android 7.0 Nougat OS and the new Google In Apps phone search function. Coming soon to consumers across the U.S., the all-new V20 will be available at AT&T, B&H, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, Verizon, select Best Buy stores and BestBuy.com. The LG V series is a premium flagship smartphone line designed to provide users with a leading video and audio experience. In fact, the V20 was developed with "storytellers" in mind – for anyone who has something to say or anyone who has an experience to share. Delivering Share-worthy, Crisp, Clear Videos Steady Record 2.0  The LG V20, powered by the Qualcomm [®] Snapdragon™ 820 processor with X12 LTE, introduces Steady Record 2.0, leveraging Qualcomm Technologies' electronic image stabilization (EIS) 3.0 to record smooth video footage and reduce shaky images. EIS shifts the image frame by frame to counter unintentional movement and determine a smooth path for the footage – allowing the user to record clearer videos, even when they're on the move. Hi-Fi Video Recording  LG V20 owners can record Hi-Fi videos and manually control the settings to capture next level audio with their video recordings. While recording video, the V20 captures audio through three Acoustic Overload Point (AOP) mics using 24-bit / 48 kHz Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM), a format used by professional movie producers. This results in share-worthy videos from concerts and live events – without having the audio sound blown out! The Purest Audio Experience Hi-Fi Quad DAC  The V20 is the world's first smartphone to feature a 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC, powered by ESS Technology, designers of high-performance audio products. Powered by ESS SABRE ES9218, the Quad DAC in the V20 delivers clearer sound by minimizing distortion and ambient noise. With support for lossless music formats including FLAC, DSD, AIFF and ALAC, the V20 delivers high-quality audio to any pair of wired earphones. HD Audio Recorder  The HD Audio Recorder represents the next level of sound recording. This feature lets users capture studio quality audio with a wider dynamic frequency range using three high AOP microphones to record incredible sound that surpass audio recordings on conventional smartphones. With Studio Mode, users manually control sound with easy-to-use keys similar to ones found in video cameras and use Music Recorded to create high quality audio suitable for auditions by recording singing voices over existing music. B&O Play H3  Those who purchase the V20, for a limited time, will also receive a pair of B&O Play H3 Lightweight Earphones. These earphones are perfect for those who have not yet invested in nicer headphones – but still want a high quality, wired mobile audio experience. Capture It All and More Front/Rear Wide Angle Lens  The wide angle capabilities of the front and rear cameras capture photos with an inclusive background, meaning users get more in the frame and leave nothing out. The 5MP front camera with a 120-degree lens expands the selfie experience to take bigger pictures with even more friends. The 8MP rear camera with its 135-degree lens is perfect for taking pictures in front of a gorgeous vista or inside a gigantic stadium. The large aperture standard angle lens captures sharp images at a maximum of 16MP with its 75-degree lens. Auto Shot  The Auto Shot Function on the front camera produces perfect selfies with its face detection feature, which triggers the shot when the subject is ready and smiling. There is no need to press the shutter button, which can increase camera shake and the likelihood of a blurred shot. Hybrid Auto Focus  The V20's Hybrid Auto Focus (HAF) helps the user zero in on that perfect shot with quick, accurate focus in nearly any setting. Fast and stable auto focus is delivered in any environment by integrating three AF mechanisms – Laser Detection AF, Phase Detection AF and Contrast AF – for both videos and photos. The V20 determines if LDAF or PDAF is best for a particular shot and then refines the focus with Contrast AF. Users can take full advantage of the V20 when capturing sharp images of friends or family in action, in various lighting conditions. Gives You More of What You Love Second Screen  The popular Second Screen feature that was first introduced on the V10 has improved visibility features. With nearly double the brightness and 50 percent larger font size compared to the V10, the smaller display located above the main display allows users to easily view notifications and alerts in outdoor situations at a glance. With the new Expandable Notifications feature, users can tap the "expand" button on the Second Screen to enlarge notifications to check long messages at a glance and quickly send a reply or share information without leaving the app they were using. LG UX 5.0+  The LG V20 comes with the mobile user interface LG UX 5.0+ to make it easier to use the multimedia functions tailored to customer needs. The LG UX 5.0+ is an upgraded version of the LG UX 5.0 first introduced on the LG G5. It is also the world's first smartphone interface to run on Android 7.0 Nougat. The LG V20 also features Multi-window to display two apps at once in a split screen allowing users to drag text, images, and files from one app to another. The combination of these advancements together with the 5.7-inch main IPS Quantum Display offers the best in multitasking capabilities. In Apps  The LG V20 is the world's first phone to showcase Google's In Apps. The new search mode featured in the Google app, helps users find content not only from built-in apps including contacts, emails, text messages and photos, but also from user-installed apps. It also enables users to discover recently accessed apps, people to get in touch with, messages to read or activity across apps without having to type a query. Premium Design in a Durable Body Premium Materials and Durability  To achieve both a sophisticated look and solid durability, LG uses lightweight aluminum, together with a new silicon-based material. AL6013 metal, found in aircraft, sailboats and mountain bikes, was selected to cover the back of the phone due to its sturdy but light properties. The top and bottom of the phone are protected from damage by Silicone Polycarbonate (Si-PC). This innovative material, found in helmets, can reduce shocks by more than 20 percent compared to conventional materials. The LG V20 has also passed the MIL-STD 810G Transit Drop Test for durability conducted by an independent laboratory that conforms to U.S. military standards. "The LG V20 is designed to offer customers a more dynamic experience by building on the most popular video and audio features of the V series," said Juno Cho, president of LG Electronics and Mobile Communications Company. "With the LG V20, we are giving our customers more of everything they love and less of anything they don't need to set a new standard for premium smartphones." The LG V20 will be available in Korea starting this month followed by other regions. Information regarding other markets and launch dates will be announced locally in the weeks to come.

The plan would allow companies like Google to move existing utility lines as they install their own high-speed fiber network. Comcast and AT&T have both come out against the ordinance, while Google has said it may stop rolling out its Google Fiber network if the plan doesn’t pass. The bill passed its first reading last month. Chris Levendos, director of National Deployment and Operations with Google Fiber, issued the following statement after Metro Council’s vote: We're pleased that Nashville Metro Council supports Council Member Davis’ proposal for a 21st century framework, 32-7. Improving the make-ready construction process is key to unlocking access to a faster Internet for Nashville, and this Ordinance will allow new entrants like Google Fiber to bring broadband to more Nashvillians efficiently, safely and quickly.  We look forward to continuing our work with NES and other attachers to bring our service to more homes and businesses in Nashville, faster. AT&T Tennessee President Joelle Phillips also responded to Tuesday night’s meeting: Many members of the Metro Council called tonight for a deferral. We appreciate their focus on policies that speed fiber deployment without setting aside contracts. As amended, the ordinance is at odds with our collective bargaining agreement with the CWA, our joint use contract with NES and even the contract we have with Google. Those contracts relate to some of the most important parts of our business - our employees and our network.  While we are disappointed with tonight’s outcome, we will continue to advocate for a non-legislative solution ahead of the final vote.

Google's services have become a little faster across Asia, courtesy of a new high-speed undersea cable linking the company's largest data center in that continent with its data centers in the United States. The new fiber-optic cable should help Google Apps, Cloud Platform and other Internet services load up more quickly across the region and bolster the company's service consistency and reliability in Asia, said Google regional lead Yan Tang in a blog post. Google and five other members of a group called the FASTER Consortium started bringing the high-speed 5,600-mile FASTER Cable System online in June. The cable has a total bandwidth of 60 terabits per second, of which Google can access up to 10T bps. The cable starts in Oregon in the United States and ends up in the Chiba and Mie prefectures in Japan. In the past few months, Google has worked on extending the Trans-Pacific link across more of Asia via a cable connecting FASTER's landing points in Japan with Taiwan, where Google's largest data center in Asia is located. The millions of people across Asia that the Taiwan data center serves should have quicker access to services and tools as a result of the new link. According to Cheung, the new link between its Taiwan data center and Japan will support bandwidth speeds of up to 26T bps (image courtesy of Google). "You may not notice right away, but this new cable should help Google products and services load more quickly across the region," Cheung said. The fiber cable has been strategically deployed outside of tsunami zones to mitigate the risk of network outages resulting from such natural disasters. More people are coming online in Asia than in any other region of the world, so Google has been investing heavily in ramping up its infrastructure in the region, Cheung said. Over the past few years, Google has built two major data centers in Asia, one in Singapore and the other in Taiwan. Last year, the company began work on a second, larger data center in Singapore right next to its present facility in the country. The new multilevel data center is expected to come online in 2017 and is being built on a plot of land roughly the same size as the one on which the first Singapore data center was constructed. With the expansion, Google says it has spent some $500 million on its Singapore facility so far and a total of slightly more than $1 billion on its Asian data centers. Google has described the FASTER cable as the fastest undersea fiber-optic cable that has been built so far. According to officials at cable supplier NEC, FASTER is the first submarine cable across the Pacific that has been designed from the ground up to support "digital coherent transmission technology." Work on the system began in August 2014. Besides Google, other members of the consortium include Singtel, China Mobile International, Global Transit, KDDI and China Telecom.           LATEST NETWORKING ARTICLES   Nutanix Brings Networking Into Its Enterprise Cloud Platform Cypress Adds Connectivity Option to WICED IoT Platform BT, CA Make Deeper Pushes Into Growing SD-WAN Space Cisco Brings Flexible Payments, App Site to Spark Collaboration Tool Dell EMC, SnapRoute Expand Contributions to OpenSwitch Project                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

The device will apparently be built by the Nexus 6P manufacturer, Huawei, and it may just be the successor to the Nexus 9. The rumor of a new Google Android tablet first popped up on Twitter  thanks to notorious leaker, Evan Blass (@evleaks). Blass claims that the new Huawei-built 7-inch tablet will come with 4GB of RAM and that it will be released before the end of the year. As of this writing, Blass hasn’t given any additional information about the tablet. It was reported last week that Google’s upcoming smartphones this year will be called the Pixel and Pixel XL, completely dropping the Nexus name. This has also led to speculations that the new tablet that Blass is talking about may not be marketed as a Nexus device and may be called something else. Previous reports have indicated that the upcoming tablet may be the Huawei 7P, a name that was discovered to have been trademarked by Huawei back in April. In late 2015, Google was also rumored to be planning on making a new tablet with Huawei that would combine the best parts of the 2013 Nexus 7 and the Pixel C. In 2014, Google released the Nexus 9, the successor to the Nexus 7, and it was built by HTC. In 2015, the company released the Pixel C, a premium Android tablet that comes with an optional magnetic keyboard. The Nexus 9 is now rocking hardware that’s out of date and it’s considered as a lackluster successor to the Nexus 7, while the Pixel C is not that affordable with its $500 price tag. It would be apt for Google to release a new tablet this year considering that there hasn’t been much competition lately, particularly in the affordable range. If Blass is accurate with the 7-inch size, then it looks like Google is trying to replicate the success of the Nexus 7, which is considered by many users as the ideal Android tablet, as pointed out by The Verge. Google will be holding a major hardware event on October 4. The Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones are expected to be announced at the event along with the new Chromecast, the Daydream VR headset, and now, possibly a new 7-inch Android tablet built by Huawei.         LATEST STORIES (76) When UN Spurns International Law, Resolution of the Wicked Happens Iran Renews Support for Political Solution to Yemen Crisis Battle for Mosul Day 30: Tal Afar Airport Taken Back Syrian People in Tartus Receive Humanitarian Aids Iraq: ISIL Arrests, Transfers 2,000 Mosul Citizens to Tal Afar for Human Shield Envoy: Giant Russian Energy Firms to Visit Iran for Oil Contracts Kuwait to Replace Riyadh as Main Egypt Oil Supplier Report: ISIL Orders Militants to Avoid Shooting at US-Led Coalition Warplanes Terrorism Index: ISIL Defeats Brought Iraq Deaths down 32% Iran Voices Readiness to Help Cuba in Nanotechnology Russian Military: Terrorists Executing Militants Ready to Surrender in Aleppo Syrian Army Readying to Launch Attack on Al-Bab Iraqi Forces Tap Terrorists' Turkish-Language Communications at Tal Afar Airport Israeli Forces Detain 12-Year-Old, 9 Others in Jerusalem, West Bank Raids Baghdad Deploys Forces only 4 Kilometers Away from Central Mosul When UN Spurns International Law, Resolution of the Wicked Happens TEHRAN (FNA)- The United Nations General Assembly’s Human Rights Committee is supposed to serve with the utmost objectivity and commitment to international law and norms.

A subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., Google has been part of the six-member FASTER Consortium that began operating the world's fastest undersea cable to date in June this year between the United States and Japan. Yan Tang, Google Network Resource's Asia-Pacific regional lead, posted a blog saying the company based in Mountain View, northern California, further extended the Trans-Pacific link from Japan to China's Taiwan province, where Google has its largest data center in Asia. At speeds of up to 26 terabits per second, "this new cable should help Google products and services load more quickly across the region," Tang noted, adding that the experience should also be more reliable, as the cable was built outside of tsunami zones to help prevent network outages related to natural disasters. In addition to Google, China Mobile International, China Telecom Global, Global Transit of Malaysia, KDDI of Japan and SingTel of Singapore are members of the FASTER Consortium. Built with about 300 million U.S. dollars and 100Gb/s x 100 wavelengths optical transmission technologies, the 6-fiber-pair cable system lands at Bandon, Oregon, in the United State and Chikura and Shima in Japan. It reaches major data communications hubs on the U.S. West Coast covering the Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle areas and connects many cable systems in Asian countries and regions neighboring Japan.

According to market research, 90 percent of smartphone shoppers don't have a specific brand in mind when they begin shopping, and nearly half of Americans consult blogs for shopping ideas. AdWords simply gives users ads from whichever company they may have searched in the past, ignoring these above facts. The new shop the look system incorporates blogging into its algorithm, increasing the likelihood of users finding what they want. Like a standard AdWords campaign, shop the look works through search terms. However, rather than just pitching ads, shop the look suggests pages from major fashion blogs. Users can then click on whichever blog image they find most appealing, and the system then brings the user to the product pages for those clothing items.

Forty applications in the Google Play store contain a new family of malware, dubbed DressCode. The malicious applications could be used to infect corporate BYOD mobile devices and access internal network or corporate web servers, according to Check Point researchers. The malware family is named “DressCode,” after one of the popular malicious applications, a game called “Dress up Musa Winx.” Other malicious apps found on Google Play included “Dress up princess Apple White,” “Forsaken House,” and "Dark Goddess.” Another 400 applications embedded with the malware strain were discovered on third-party app stores. Check Point mobile security evangelist Jeff Zacuto told SCMagazine.com that enterprises “rely on the protections that Google uses to keep end users personal information safe” but he said many enterprises are “slow to realise that securing mobile endpoint(s) is critical” due to the vulnerable nature of Android devices. An attacker could exploit infected mobile devices by establishing communication with the device and sending the device a command to retrieve internal files from internal networks if the infected device has access to an internal corporate network. READ NEXT: How does a VPN work and should you use one? In a Wednesday blog post, Check Point researchers Alon Menczer and Alexander Lysunets wrote that Google has removed some of the malicious apps from Google Play. The oldest apps containing the DressCode malware family were uploaded into the Google Play store in April. Between 500,000 and 2,000,000 users downloaded the apps from Google Play. The malware strain uses proxied IP addresses to create smartphone-enabled botnets, a method that is similar to the attack employed by the Viking Horde malware discovered by Check Point in May. “The ability to turn these devices in zombies is the scary aspect,” Zacuto told SCMagazine.com. “It's kind of like sleeper cells.” The attack method goes beyond targeted attacks and enables “targeted attacks with laser precision,” he added.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Just like how Microsoft’s Internet Explorer used to be lambasted for its functionality, so was Google’s Chrome browser in terms of it being slow and battery intensive on laptops. However to Google’s credit, they have made some pretty decent strides over the years at trying to improve Chrome’s battery life. So much so that Google has recently penned a blog post and also released a video showing just how far along Chrome has come in terms of being energy efficient. In the video, it shows how Chrome 53 has improved in terms of battery life compared to Chrome 46 from a year ago. According to Google, they claim that the latest version of Chrome will be able to play video via websites like Vimeo for an added 2 hours 12 minutes compared to last year’s build. However since users use Chrome for more than just watching videos, Google is also boasting how surfing the web is also more energy efficient, like on Mac where Chrome users 33% less power. “As one example, Chrome for Mac now uses 33 percent less power for everything from videos and images to simple page scrolling. Whether you’re planning a vacation or getting work done, you now get more browsing time from a single battery charge.” At the end of the day whether or not Chrome is the browser for you really depends on your personal preference, but if you’re an avid user of Chrome, we guess this update just serves to highlight how far the browser has come over the years.

Skip to content Repeating Islands News and commentary on Caribbean culture, literature, and the arts Toggle Sidebar September 6, 2016 What This Former Google Exec Did After She Left Her Job Changed Her Life Maryann Reid (digital managing editor of BlackEnterprise.com) features Shelley Worrell (founder and CEO of CaribBEING) and how she is creating a new voice for the global Caribbean community. Here are excerpts; see full article at Black Enterprise. It started when she bought a shipping container and turned it into a pop-up art space. Shelley Worrell is the Founder and CEO of CaribBEING, a non-profit and cultural space that celebrates Caribbean heritage, in the rapidly gentrifying neighborhood of Flatbush, Brooklyn. It’s not a store or shop; it is a “miniaturized mobile museum,” as Shelley puts it.  Sitting inside the Tea Room at the Flatbush Caton Market, Worrell sits poised, with her hair perfectly coifed in a curly fro and crimson red lipstick.  Her demeanor echoes her Google executive past with a laid back vibe that is influenced by her new surroundings. It wasn’t too long ago that Worrell worked as a Strategic Partner Development Manager at Google, but decided that she needed to spend more time with family. Thus, she developed CaribBEING to what it is today. Now, Worrell is in charge of making visitors feel like they are transported to the Caribbean. Every inch of the container, including the repurposed windows, mimics the feel of a breezy, beachside bar.  The plywood and bespoke floors are made out of oak and were designed and installed by an interior architect. The custom designed tropical rainforest wallpaper was installed by an artist.  To top it off, a falling door concept was conceived by the lead architect in Berlin, Germany. Worrell adds, “By us even being in this courtyard with a vendor selling coconut and sugar canes, as well as another vendor who’s selling Caribbean flags, it really adds to the whole ambiance and experience.” Worrell has masterfully blended her Google work ethic and business strategy to make CaribBEING a one-of-a-kind business, supporting her lifestyle and needs for connecting to her Trinidadian roots. She realizes that it takes a certain kind of finesse to run a business, which some people are seeing for the first time. Here are several strategies she used to make her transition from Google to becoming her own global brand. Here are several strategies she used to make her transition from Google to becoming her own global brand: Make It Mobile It’s a shipping container—that travels.  Part of the funding for the shipping container was made possible by a corporate partnership with Airbnb, which was an early supporter of the project, co-hosting three events with CaribBEING as part of this collaboration.  The container itself was $2,000, but with customization, came out between $20,000-$25,000 to turn it into a piece of real estate. “To have your own, owned and operated space where you don’t have to wait for someone to invite you to an exhibition or a program, [means] you can have a program on demand,” Worrell says. [. . .] Go Global Worrell is determined to make CaribBEING and Caribbean culture part of global speak, with words like “afropolitan” and “Caribpolitan.” Worrell explains that Caribpolitan is someone who is born from Caribbean parents, is usually a first generation, and has a strong Caribbean experience in the home, from the food they eat to the traditions they follow. However, there’s a twist. “You also couple that with going out in the world and into these large cities, such as New York, Paris, Miami, Toronto and Montreal. We feel like that is a very unique identity, because we have that city flavor that is also mixed with the Caribbean.” Rihanna and Nicki Minaj are prime examples of Caribbean women that have infused global influences into their style and self-expression. Hashtags like #caribbeing are everywhere on social media, and more are cropping up as young people continue to identify more with their Caribbean culture.

The new V20 phone comes on the eve of a San Francisco event where Apple is expected to launch new iPhones. Nougat is already available as a free upgrade on some Google phones under the Nexus brand.  In this Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2016, photo, the LG V20 is demonstrated in New York. The most visible changes include the ability to run two apps side-by-side. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) LG'S V20 SPECS  Snapdragon™ 820 processor Android 7.0 Nougat OS  Higher-quality audio playback and recording Improved image stabilization when recording video The V20 would be the first with Nougat already installed.  Other phones aren't likely to get Nougat for a while because individual phone makers and wireless carriers have to tweak and test the new software first. Many of the Android improvements in Nougat are 'under the hood' and thus largely invisible, such as tweaks to reduce battery consumption and cellular data use. The most obvious changes include the ability to run two apps side by side, something Samsung and LG have offered on their phones on a limited basis.  Nougat will also let people reply to messages within notifications, something Apple already offers on iPhones.

One lens is for taking regular pictures and the other has wide-angle capability to capture more of a scene. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Meanwhile, the V20 promises higher-quality audio playback and recording, with reduced background noise, according to LG.  The company also says it also improved image stabilization when recording video. LG spokesman Frank Lee described the V20's target audience as 'storytellers.' In this Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2016, photo, the LG V20 is demonstrated in New York. The South Korean company is unveiling the first phone to ship with Google's new Android Nougat software, one the phone maker hopes to appeal to people who like to take and share photos and video. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) The LG V20 is demonstrated in New York. Like LG's G5 phone, which it released in April, the V20 will have two lenses on the main camera — one for regular pictures and one with a wide angle to capture more of the scene.  Unlike many other top-line phones, the V20 features a replaceable battery. The V20 is expected in South Korea this month, with other markets, including the U.S., to follow. LG didn't immediately announce prices. Apple also plans to update its phone software this month.  The update, iOS 10, will come with new messanging and photo features and more detailed notifications on the lock screen.  Existing iPhone users will be encouraged to upgrade for the software for free.  New iPhones expected to be unveiled Wednesday will come with iOS 10. In this Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2016, photo, the removable battery plate, left, is shown with the LG V20, in New York. The phone opens like a cosmetic powder case, allowing users to swap batteries.

Built by Asus, the 7-inch tablet was reasonably powerful at the time, and, perhaps most importantly, its $230 launch price made it very affordable. A new rumor from known leaker Evan Blass suggests that a successor to the Nexus 7 may be on its way. This new 7-inch Google tablet will be built by Huawei, who also co-designed the 5.7-inch Nexus 6P smartphone, and will launch with 4 GB of RAM. Blass says the tablet is "on track for release before the end of the year". News of a new 7-inch tablet from Huawei fits with a trademark that was filed back in April for a "Huawei 7P". Google's Nexus products haven't historically included the manufacturer in the product name – it's simply the "Nexus 6P", not the Huawei Nexus 6P – but the trademark has perhaps given an indication of what Huawei has been working on throughout this year. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 Of course it's unlikely that any successor to the Nexus 7 would actually be branded as 'Nexus'. Google is reportedly phasing out the Nexus brand in favor of 'Pixel' for their upcoming HTC-made smartphones, due to changes in the software experience that will make these phones more than just stock Android showcases. We expect a similar branding choice for this Huawei-made 7-inch tablet. Since the popular second-gen Nexus 7 was launched more than three years ago, Google's tablet line-up has been somewhat uninspiring. The Nexus 9 was a powerful piece of hardware, but quickly fell out of love with consumers, while the Pixel C's keyboard dock (the main selling point) didn't work well with Android at the time. Huawei tends to make respectable Android hardware, so this upcoming tablet could be a return to form for Google.

SUBSCRIBE How many days has it been since the last Google Penguin Update? Caught by the Penguin anti-spam filter and fixed your site? Here's how long you've been waiting for a chance to be released. Danny Sullivan on September 6, 2016 at 5:35 pm More The Google Penguin Update is a filter designed to help Google combat severe forms of spam in its search results. This page tells you how long it has been since the last Penguin Update, which is helpful for those hoping to escape the penalty. Penguin operates on a periodic basis. When it happens, it catches and penalizes a set of sites. It also releases some sites previously caught, if they’ve reformed themselves in a way that Google likes. During the time between updates, any sites penalized by Penguin remain that way until a fresh update happens. Even if they correct problem areas, the penalty carries on until the next Penguin update happens. That’s a wait that can last for over a year. Below is our clock that counts the days since the last Penguin update: Here are the exact dates of all Penguin Updates since the filter was first developed by Google: Here are dates of all Penguin releases and the time elapsed from the previous update: Penguin 1.0 on April 24, 2012 Penguin 1.1 on May 26, 2012 (one month) Penguin 1.2 on October 5, 2012 (four months) Penguin 2.0 on May 22, 2013 (five months) Penguin 2.1 on Oct. 4, 2013 (four months) Penguin 3.0 on October 17, 2014 (one year) For more about the Penguin Update, including all our latest news and developments on it, see our Penguin Update page.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Sep 6, 2016 at 7:19PM Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are important. Over the past 30 years, nearly half of the total return produced by the S&P 500 index has been due to dividends. While young companies with strong growth prospects should generally be retaining and investing their earnings, mature companies generating more cash than they can possibly invest at a reasonable rate of return owe it to shareholders to begin paying out dividends. Technology companies aren't known to be the best dividend payers, but many of the largest have turned their focus to dividends in recent years. Microsoft began paying a dividend back in 2003, Cisco initiated its dividend in 2011, and Apple began sending cash to shareholders in 2012 after a long hiatus. For all three of these companies, profits are so large that there simply aren't enough opportunities to invest at acceptable rates of return. There are a few technology companies that should be part of this list of dividend payers, but have instead chosen to eschew dividends. Here's why Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) need to start paying dividends to investors. Alphabet Image source: Alphabet. Alphabet, which is comprised of Google and a variety of smaller businesses like Nest and Fiber, has grown to become a tech behemoth. Over the past decade, revenue has risen by a factor of seven, net income has surged by a factor of five, and free cash flow has increased tenfold. The company generated $75 billion in revenue in 2015, nearly surpassing Microsoft. Alphabet is still growing quickly. During its latest quarter, revenue jumped 21% year over year, driven by strong performance at Google. This continued growth at Google and all of the opportunities available to Alphabet's other companies seem like strong arguments for Alphabet to delay becoming a dividend payer. But the company already generates so much cash, even after investing heavily in new businesses, that Alphabet just ends up hoarding it. At the end of the latest quarter, Alphabet had about $78 billion of cash and barely any debt. That cash is accomplishing nothing for the company or for shareholders. Alphabet does buy back its own shares, spending $3.7 billion on buybacks during the first six months of this year. But with free cash flow topping $16 billion last year, even after spending nearly $10 billion on capital expenditures, there's simply no excuse for not initiating a dividend. Just like Apple finally gave in and started returning cash to shareholders, Google needs to do the same. NXP Semiconductors Image source: NXP Semiconductors. The semiconductor business is cyclical, meaning that profits fluctuate for many companies in the sector. But NXP Semiconductors, following its merger with Freescale Semiconductor, is now one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Even as it faces subdued demand in nearly all of its core markets, the company is still generating boatloads of cash. Free cash flow was $363 million during the second quarter, up 15% year over year. Over the past 12 months, free cash flow has totaled nearly $1.1 billion. Like Alphabet, NXP routinely repurchases its own shares. Unfortunately for investors, that spending hasn't exactly accomplished much. Despite buying back $1.8 billion worth of its own shares in 2013 and 2014, the share count barely moved. Now, with dilution caused by the Freescale merger, the share count has soared even higher. Instead of "returning cash to shareholders" by simply counteracting dilution caused by stock-based compensation, NXP should begin paying a dividend. The company has plenty of growth opportunities ahead of it, particularly in the automotive industry, but it's generating more cash than it can effectively employ. Adobe Systems Image source: Adobe Systems. After a multiyear effort to transition from selling perpetual software licenses to selling software subscriptions, Adobe has emerged stronger than ever. Profitability took a temporary hit during 2013 and 2014 due to this transition, but the company has now fully recovered. Over the past 12 months, Adobe generated nearly $1.6 billion of free cash flow, higher than in any year during the past decade. Adobe actively buys back its own shares, spending nearly $3 billion from 2012 through 2015 on buybacks. The share count has actually increased during that time, though, rising from 504 million shares at the end of 2011 to 507 million shares at the end of 2015. Like NXP, Adobe's plan to return cash to shareholders isn't actually accomplishing anything. Adobe's core business is selling creative software like Photoshop, a market where the company is completely dominant. This software should continue to generate plenty of cash for the foreseeable future -- all the more reason to begin paying dividends. Adobe should stop treading water with its wasteful buyback program and begin truly rewarding shareholders. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 7 September 2016 | MYT 6:00 AM Pokémon Go goes to Google Maps Show em the monsters: Google Maps’ new option allows you to show other Pokemon players where you saw the creatures. — AFP Relaxnews Anyone that was hoping that we'd already reached peak Pokémon Go, prepare to be disappointed. Google has just added a ‘Catching Pokémon' option to its Google Maps timeline feature, alongside more traditional forms of transport. The new setting doesn't mean that you can ask Google Maps to plot a Pokémon-laden route from point A to point B when out and about, but it does mean that you can record activity – i.e., where you've been and when you were there – while out playing the game as well as for walking, cycling or taking public transport. Timeline isn't exactly Google Maps' standout feature but it could well prove popular for other gamers as it is a way of showing players where you were when you saw Pokémons and for others to do likewise.—  AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Billionaire Ananda Krishnan exploring taking Astro private India bans Zakir Naik's NGO Maybank sells entire stake in Visa Inc for RM413mil Beware of Rove beetles Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Petronas’ net profit soars on lower impairment losses, other factors Malindo Air offering one million tickets to celebrate winning award Catch Doctor-X on the all-new dimsum.my! advertisement Latest News Rideshare service Lyft gets a flashy new look Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Most Viewed in Tech Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Warning!

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Sep 6, 2016 at 7:19PM Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are important. Over the past 30 years, nearly half of the total return produced by the S&P 500 index has been due to dividends. While young companies with strong growth prospects should generally be retaining and investing their earnings, mature companies generating more cash than they can possibly invest at a reasonable rate of return owe it to shareholders to begin paying out dividends. Technology companies aren't known to be the best dividend payers, but many of the largest have turned their focus to dividends in recent years. Microsoft began paying a dividend back in 2003, Cisco initiated its dividend in 2011, and Apple began sending cash to shareholders in 2012 after a long hiatus. For all three of these companies, profits are so large that there simply aren't enough opportunities to invest at acceptable rates of return. There are a few technology companies that should be part of this list of dividend payers, but have instead chosen to eschew dividends. Here's why Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) need to start paying dividends to investors. Alphabet Image source: Alphabet. Alphabet, which is comprised of Google and a variety of smaller businesses like Nest and Fiber, has grown to become a tech behemoth. Over the past decade, revenue has risen by a factor of seven, net income has surged by a factor of five, and free cash flow has increased tenfold. The company generated $75 billion in revenue in 2015, nearly surpassing Microsoft. Alphabet is still growing quickly. During its latest quarter, revenue jumped 21% year over year, driven by strong performance at Google. This continued growth at Google and all of the opportunities available to Alphabet's other companies seem like strong arguments for Alphabet to delay becoming a dividend payer. But the company already generates so much cash, even after investing heavily in new businesses, that Alphabet just ends up hoarding it. At the end of the latest quarter, Alphabet had about $78 billion of cash and barely any debt. That cash is accomplishing nothing for the company or for shareholders. Alphabet does buy back its own shares, spending $3.7 billion on buybacks during the first six months of this year. But with free cash flow topping $16 billion last year, even after spending nearly $10 billion on capital expenditures, there's simply no excuse for not initiating a dividend. Just like Apple finally gave in and started returning cash to shareholders, Google needs to do the same. NXP Semiconductors Image source: NXP Semiconductors. The semiconductor business is cyclical, meaning that profits fluctuate for many companies in the sector. But NXP Semiconductors, following its merger with Freescale Semiconductor, is now one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Even as it faces subdued demand in nearly all of its core markets, the company is still generating boatloads of cash. Free cash flow was $363 million during the second quarter, up 15% year over year. Over the past 12 months, free cash flow has totaled nearly $1.1 billion. Like Alphabet, NXP routinely repurchases its own shares. Unfortunately for investors, that spending hasn't exactly accomplished much. Despite buying back $1.8 billion worth of its own shares in 2013 and 2014, the share count barely moved. Now, with dilution caused by the Freescale merger, the share count has soared even higher. Instead of "returning cash to shareholders" by simply counteracting dilution caused by stock-based compensation, NXP should begin paying a dividend. The company has plenty of growth opportunities ahead of it, particularly in the automotive industry, but it's generating more cash than it can effectively employ. Adobe Systems Image source: Adobe Systems. After a multiyear effort to transition from selling perpetual software licenses to selling software subscriptions, Adobe has emerged stronger than ever. Profitability took a temporary hit during 2013 and 2014 due to this transition, but the company has now fully recovered. Over the past 12 months, Adobe generated nearly $1.6 billion of free cash flow, higher than in any year during the past decade. Adobe actively buys back its own shares, spending nearly $3 billion from 2012 through 2015 on buybacks. The share count has actually increased during that time, though, rising from 504 million shares at the end of 2011 to 507 million shares at the end of 2015. Like NXP, Adobe's plan to return cash to shareholders isn't actually accomplishing anything. Adobe's core business is selling creative software like Photoshop, a market where the company is completely dominant. This software should continue to generate plenty of cash for the foreseeable future -- all the more reason to begin paying dividends. Adobe should stop treading water with its wasteful buyback program and begin truly rewarding shareholders. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Search for: Main menu Skip to content Home Tablet Edition Departments OPERATIONAL TRAINING TECHNOLOGY & HARDWARE PORTRAITS & PROFILES OFF-DUTY AIRMAN VISUALS AIRMAN PHOTO OF THE MONTH ARCHIVE Tablet Edition Print Edition Mental Warfare The Air Force fight to attract top-flight minds Story and Photos by J.M. Eddins Jr. 6 September 2016 The evolution of the internet has begun transforming society from a planet of nations and individuals to a global interconnected digital culture. Yesterday’s pilots, engineers and scientists, born in an analog environment, are giving way to a generation raised in a digital world of coders, computer engineers and gamers. The U.S. Air Force depends heavily on the digital generation to keep its technological advantage. Yet the Air Force must compete with private tech companies like Google and SpaceX in order to recruit the nation’s best minds to deal with tomorrow’s problems and provide needed innovation. ROTC students and Air Force advisors from Cornell University shed light on the digital dilemma the military is now facing as recruiting becomes more strategic and cultural in the 21st century.(U.S. Air Force video by Andrew Arthur Breese) During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein admitted the service has been fighting a war with outdated tactics. Not a war in some foreign land, but one within the nation’s own borders. The field of battle is the open market. The objective: convince some of the most innovative minds in the country — those trained in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) — to work for the Air Force. “I absolutely align with Secretary (of Defense Ashton) Carter that we are in a war for talent and one of the initiatives that is under his ‘Force of the Future’ allows us to go directly to a university and hire talent from that university,” Goldfein testified. “What we have done in the past is to tell those that are interested in joining us to go ahead and get on USA Jobs, post all their resumes and maybe we’ll get back to them in six months; (by then) they’re gone. It’s unacceptable in this environment.” CLICK TO VIEW PHOTO GALLERY The order of battle proposed by Carter looks to streamline hiring practices to position the Defense Department as a hotbed for scientific research talent. It also has new tactics that include opening the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) in California’s Silicon Valley, building cooperation between the military and tech companies, and career intermission programs that allow military researchers to get a taste of the research being pursued at private companies. The defense secretary has even invited vetted hackers to test the Pentagon’s cybersecurity. These new tactics are designed to keep control of territory already held: retaining STEM talent currently employed by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). By allowing Air Force researchers more latitude in their research and flexibility in career paths, the hope is that job satisfaction will increase and, therefore, retention. Ryan Helbach, a Hypersonic Research Engineer, holds a flight test model in Hypersonic Combustion Research Cell 22, used to research SCRAM jet technology at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, Jul 21, 2016. Helbach is the program lead for AFRL’s Intellect to Intellect Exchange (i2i Exchange) which pairs AFRL scientists and engineers with innovative private tech companies and created the AFRL Entrepreneurial Program allowing scientists and engineers to take sabbaticals to pursue outside for-profit goals. It’s a tactic that has kept Ryan Helbach, a hypersonic engineer for AFRL at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, studying Supersonic Combustion Ramjet technology for the Air Force. “I was thinking of leaving the Air Force, but after talking with friends and coworkers I realized I have a fantastic opportunity here in the Air Force and the Air Force Research Labs to shape my job,” he said. “I get to do the engineering, but I also get to create programs that have a lot of influence on the careers of other scientists and engineers that work within the research labs.” Create he has. Helbach is involved in two programs designed to increase workplace satisfaction among his peers and build bridges between AFRL and the private sector. “We have set up this program called the Intellect to Intellect (i2i) Exchange where we are working with a number of different (smaller private tech) companies to try to take some of our folks that are working with deep learning or autonomy or robotics and embed them (with those companies),” Helbach said. “We want to work with them and tap into some of those innovative technologies that we are not working on currently or that we are working on, but we could tap into some different ideas.” Helbach and 1st Lt David McLellan, talk in Hypersonic Combustion Research Cell 22, used in research into SCRAM jet technology, at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, Jul 21, 2016. Helbach has also co-created the AFRL Entrepreneurial Program, which allows for scientists and engineers to pursue personal business projects utilizing AFRL technology through one-year sabbaticals. If the technology is successfully commercialized, they can separate from AFRL to pursue the venture with an agreement that they can return within five years. If the project shows no promise, they can return to their old jobs at the end of the sabbatical year. The Air Force is also fighting this battle on another front — the nation’s schools. To create a constant stream of new technological talent flowing toward AFRL, the Air Force must educate students to the scientific opportunities that exist at its research labs before they choose an employer or career path. In this challenge, the Air Force has achieved some pockets of success within the geographical spheres of influence surrounding  bases hosting research labs. In these geographical areas, STEM outreach programs are plentiful and assisted by word of mouth and familial ties to the Air Force. “I come from a family of nerds and we are a family of military nerds… I was genetically predetermined to be a nerd,” said Cassandra Stanfill, a human factors engineer at AFRL who uses eye-tracking technology and other methods to measure the physical response and stress of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance analysts. Cassandra Stanfill, an Associate Research Engineer with the Intelligence, Surveillance Augmentation and Reconnaissance Branch at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, uses eye tracking technology, and other methods, on test subject Lt. Michael Emard to examine the response of ISR analysts to displays, tools and interfaces used in their jobs, Jul 21, 2016. The research strives to relieve user fatigue and stress due to data overload and increase the efficiency of data assessment and transference by analysts. She grew up near Wright-Patterson AFB with a mother who was active-duty Army, and later became a statistician, and a father who was active-duty Air Force and a human factors engineer. Growing up in a military culture and having the inside scoop on AFRL ingrained in her some of the big selling points of doing research for the Air Force. “The research labs have a multitude of things you can study and work on and you get job security here, which is difficult to find right now,” Stanfill said. “There is so much we can do here that can make an impact. When our Airman can do their jobs more effectively, more efficiently, it helps secure the freedoms and the privileges that we enjoy. I work with cool stuff, I make a difference and I have job that I know I am safe in.” Second Lt. Scott Seidenberger was commissioned May 28, 2016, the day he graduated with a degree from the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Former Cadet and now Second Lt. Scott Seidenberger, of AFROTC Detachment 520 at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, stands in a commons area of Duffield Hall where science, technology, engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) students gather to study and work on team projects, Apr. 16, 2016. Before reporting for air battle management training at Tyndall AFB, Florida, he and his dissertation committee are editing his thesis, titled “Can the Government and Military Compete with Private Sector Companies for Technical Talent?” in hopes of it being published in a leading academic journal of human resource management. His research, which probes how technical job seekers evaluate opportunities in different sectors and with different firms, sheds light on one of the main obstacles to luring STEM talent away from the warm, for-profit glow of Silicon Valley; so much of what the Air Force Research Labs do is classified, producing few commercial products that civilians use in their daily lives. “It’s called the Halo Effect… So we all use products from Google, Apple and Microsoft day to day and a lot of us evaluate those products favorably,” said Seidenberger. “So there is a spillover effect where we are much more likely to subconsciously think ‘Hmmm… Google must be a good employer’… the defense sector struggles with this effect because most young people do not interact with the defense sector on a day-to-day basis; they are not as familiar with the products and the services that we provide. That’s the challenge for us, trying to build an employer brand and an image for ourselves that is able to compete with the private sector.” The Air Force is attempting to promote the selling points at universities and conferences far from the gate of an Air Force base. The Air Force Diversity and Inclusion office, in coordination with Air Force Recruiting Service, AFRL, U.S. Air Force Academy and Air Force Civilian Service, has developed a nationwide recruiting effort at STEM-focused professional conferences that attract a large number of students. Also, programs do exist to reach college undergraduates, such as the AFRL Scholars program, the Minority Leaders Research Collaboration Program and the Pathways Internship Program. However, getting the word out about research opportunities in the Air Force on STEM-heavy campuses, not adjacent to a base, is often limited to an occasional job fair. On that battlefield, the service must fight for attention in a hall surrounded by the glitz of consumer tech company recruiters armed with a well-known brand, workplaces that resemble playgrounds and better pay and benefits. In 2014, AFRL sought to improve its visibility with STEM undergraduates by initiating the University Relations Program to establish formal relationships with the country’s prominent technical universities and visit as many as possible during the year. Members of the AFRL senior executive service and senior scientists assist with maintaining and growing these relationships, according to Kevin Gooder, chief of the program integration division for the assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition. Students on the Cornell University Mars Rover Team, from left front, Changxu Lu, Corinne Lippe, Matthew Filipek, Thomas Ilyevsky, Capt. Kevin O’Brien, faculty advisor, and Nicole Polemeni-Hegarty, and in background John Draikiwicz, Jane Duin, Emma Carpenter and Jacob Glueck, ready their rover design for the University Mars Rover Challenge for testing in a lab at Phillips Hall on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, Apr. 16, 2016. However, any influence the Air Force gains during the rest of the semester is largely dependent on the presence of personnel pursuing advanced degrees and the service’s emphasis on volunteerism within its ranks. The service’s STEM workforce strategy, Bright Horizons, was signed by former CSAF Gen. Mark A. Welsh, who encouraged all Airmen to “embrace the innovation culture, participate in education and training endeavors and continue to be Air Force STEM ambassadors in your communities.” Capt. Kevin W. O’Brien, the operations flight commander for ROTC Detachment 520 at Cornell University, was one of Seidenberger’s instructors. O’Brien not only teaches AFROTC classes at Cornell, but, with Air Force funding, is also pursuing his Ph.D. in morphing wing technology there. His doctoral research allows him to rub shoulders with civilian undergraduate engineering students who are often surprised to see an Air Force officer getting a technical Ph.D. at an Ivy League institution. O’Brien also volunteers in the engineering community on campus by assisting an undergraduate project team building a robotic rover to compete in the University Rover Challenge held each summer at the Mars Desert Research Station near Hanksville, Utah. For the team members, working with their de-facto faculty advisor was their first contact with a military member in the STEM field. Mechanical Engineering student, Michael Bunis, a member of the Cornell University Mars Rover Team, works on a computer-generated model of a rover, which the team will enter the University Mars Rover Challenge, in a lab at Phillips Hall on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, Apr. 16, 2016. “I lived in the eastern New York City suburbs and went to high school in Connecticut,” said team member Nicole Polemeni-Hegarty, a rising junior at Cornell majoring in mechanical engineering, and currently an intern at Lockheed Martin working in a lasers and sensors lab. “I had never seen anything in high school about the possibility of doing scientific research or engineering in the Air Force. Until I met Capt. O’Brien, I had not even gotten a whiff of doing an internship with the military. Now the Air Force and DOD are definitely on my radar.” However, O’Brien thinks the Air Force should be placing scientific ambassadors at centers of technologic education. In 2014, AFRL established the University Relations Program to establish formal relationships with the country’s prominent technical universities and visit as many as possible during the year. Members of the AFRL Senior Executive Service and senior scientists assist with maintaining and growing these relationships. O’Brien said another hindrance to attracting STEM talent to uniformed service is the rigor, regimentation and rigidity of the military, especially the rank structure. “It’s possible that you could be coming out of college and be more competent and qualified than a major and, at that point, you have to wait up to 10 to 12 years until you are able to make the same impact as they are,” O’Brien said. The Air Force is currently exploring options in certain career fields to address these issues for uniformed researchers, according to Gooder. Members of the Cornell University Mars Rover Team test the rover design they will enter in the University Mars Rover Challenge outside of Phillips Hall at Cornell University, Apr. 16, 2016. Even if the Air Force changes its very culture to elevate its appeal on college campuses, it may be too little, too late. AFRL researchers believe that reaching farther back into the educational system to influence younger STEM students is key to establishing a long-term pipeline of a diverse research talent headed for AFRL. While individual STEM outreach programs that send scientists and engineers into local high schools and primary schools have existed at Air Force bases for decades, the service did not begin to coordinate its battle plan until three years ago, with the formation of the STEM Outreach Office at Wright-Patterson AFB to coordinate the programs at 30 bases in the U.S. and overseas. “One of the first things that needed to be done was to get our arms around the activities that were already happening out there,” said Richard Baker, director for Air Force K-12 STEM Outreach. “We get the obstacles out of their way and provide them the resources that they need to help enhance the programs that they are already doing… and to point them all in generally the same direction from a strategic standpoint.” Baker says that getting to kids in middle school is “the sweet spot” for STEM outreach. At this tween-age, students with an overall interest in pursuing science and math start to really consider what they want to be when they grow up. Sending Air Force engineers into local classes to work with teachers on establishing rocketry or solar car projects not only excites the students, but it also makes them aware of national-level partner programs like the Air Force Association’s CyberPatriot to engage computer students, the StellarXplorers to encourage the study of space and the Air Force-sponsored Junior Science and Humanities Symposium. Left to right, Samson Scheie, 12, Brendan Marx, 12 Samuel Snowden, 9, and Joeseph Yoeder, 11, [cq] test out their robot before competing in a First Lego League tournament at DoD’s Starbase building near the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, Jul 22, 2016. The Air Force STEM outreach offices work with the First Lego League, which teaches young students how to build and program robots made of Legos, to not only support STEM education, but also to make young technical minds aware of opportunities to pursue science in the U.S. Air Force. To reach back even farther in the educational process, Baker’s office supports partnerships with outside programs to develop STEM students. Programs like FIRST LEGO League Junior, FIRST LEGO League (FLL) and FIRST Robotics Competition are DOD embraced programs and provided grant monies to build teams of students to participate in local and national tournaments. Tournaments and teams organized and run by Air Force employees promote awareness of the service’s emphasis on science to parents and kids who come to base-hosted tournaments. In FLL, children construct robots made of LEGOs and learn to program those robots to perform certain tasks, like carrying a small object to a specific area, dropping it there and returning to its starting point. Many of the kids go on to FIRST Robotics Competition and FIRST Tech Challenge, using other materials to build more complex robots with more sophisticated programming. Samuel Snowden, 9, who is homeschooled, loves his pets, baseball and reading magazines, has a special place in his world for LEGOs. When he learned about FLL and that he could make those LEGOs move and follow his commands, he was hooked. “I was born with a Lego in my hand… then I realized that when you get into FIRST LEGO League you get to build and program robots,” Snowden said. “I thought it sounded challenging and I like things that are challenging and I also thought I might like to program sometime in my life.” Samuel’s experience at a weeklong FLL program hosted by Wright-Patterson AFB, ended with the teams’ robots going Lego-to-Lego in a tournament complete with cheerleading mentors, a public address announcer, loud music and goofy hats. However, building and programming a winning robot is just the hook for achieving FLL’s ultimate goals: teaching teamwork and understanding that the scientific process is all about learning from failed experiments and finding new ways to solve a problem. Samuel Snowden, 9, left, who is homeschooled and claims to have been born with a Lego in his hand, talks strategy with teammate Samson Scheie, 12, also homeschooled, before running their robot in the First Lego League competition at DoD’s Starbase building near the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, Jul 22, 2016. The Air Force STEM outreach offices work with the First Lego League, which teaches young students how to build and program robots made of Legos, to not only support STEM education, but also to make young technical minds aware of opportunities to pursue science in the U.S. Air Force. “I think FIRST (Lego League) is really cool and even though the robot is really fun, you shouldn’t focus on that,” he said. “You should focus on learning the First Core Values: We have fun. We are a team. We display gracious professionalism in all we do. Our coaches and mentors don’t have all the answers; we learn together as a team.” Samuel did admit that while FLL was great fun, he had previously learned about the Air Force through its most tried and true recruiting tools: family ties and cool planes. “My brother is actually in the Air Force. When I was 4 years old I thought about going into the Air Force,” he said. “I would probably want to fly F-16 (Fighting Falcon), because they are my favorite plane.” If the whole pilot thing doesn’t work out for Samuel, the seed has been planted through STEM outreach and FLL that he can, one day, work for the Air Force, just like his brother, as a scientist or engineer. Maybe he will even design and program systems for an aircraft way cooler than the F-16. Comments are closed.

Roston - Sep 6, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google Drive has made a small but significant change that better enables it to handle duplicate files. When the same file is downloaded and then re-uploaded, rather than changing the name to reflect that it is a duplicate, Drive will list the most recently uploaded file as “version x,” making it easy to see which file you edited last or to find an older version of the file that you may need. The idea here is that many people upload their files to Google Drive, then download them at some point to make changes, then upload the revised file to the cloud again. When that file is uploaded again, it can be difficult to find what you’re looking for based on naming structure, or impossible to find old pre-edit changes if the new file replaces the old one. Google explains that once this feature goes live, whatever files are uploaded with the same name will be “reduplicated, and the old file will be in revision history.” If you upload folders with the same name as existing folders, they’ll be merged together for easier management.

Sport Olympics Olympic News Paralympics 2016: Google marks the start of the games with an animated doodle Rio de Janiero is playing host to the 15th Games as the opening ceremony kicks off Caroline Mortimer @cjmortimer Tuesday 6 September 2016 22:45 BST The Paralympic flame will be lit at the opening ceremony on Wednesday Getty Google has marked the start of the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janiero with an animated Doodle showing cartoon characters competing in events.  The doodle shows several cartoon figures competing in some of the 22 different events including swimming, wheelchair racing, football and blade running.  The 11-day tournament will get underway following the opening ceremony on Wednesday with 10-time champion equestrian rider Lee Pearson due to perform as Britain's flag bearer. 2016 Rio Paralympic Games in numbers The self-described "colourful character" was chosen following a vote by the 264-strong Paralympics GB team who are competing in 19 events.  Read more Paralympics 2016: How does the classification system work?

The controversy did not end there for the athletes who were allowed to compete with US swimmer Lilly King seen "wagging her finger" at her Russian rival Yuliya Efimova who won an 11th hour appeal against a doping ban to compete.

Although the ride-sharing giant is among the many who believe driverless cars are just around the corner, the head of the university’s robotics lab thinks otherwise. Herman Herman, named the group's new director after it was gutted, believes companies are 'technically' not ready because they still need engineers the in car - and says a true self driving service is 'not even close'. Scroll down for video   Uber poached a third of Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics lab staff in 2015. Although the ride-sharing giant is among the many big players in the industry who believe driverless cars are just around the corner, the head of the university’s robotics lab thinks otherwise. Pictured is a concept drawing of Uber's self-driving cars TRUTH ABOUT DRIVERLESS  Herman Herman was named the new director of Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics lab after Uber took a third of the staff to its own researcher lab in 2015. Herman told Motherboard that Uber may be talking about self-driving cars, but the firm is no where near the reality. ‘With autonomous cars, you see these videos from Google and Uber showing a car driving around, but people have not taken it past 80 percent,’ Herman told Jordan Pearson with Motherboard. ‘It’s one of those problems where it’s easy to get to the first 80 percent, but it’s incredibly difficult to solve the last 20 percent.’ ‘For you or me to buy a car that can drive autonomously from point A to point B—it’s not even close.

Prior to Uber cleaning house, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) was well-known for its work with autonomous research. In February 2015, the two struck a deal to focus on mapping and safety technologies to support Uber’s ride-sharing mission.

Share this article Share 17 shares However, it only took three months before the California firm left the university in crisis by taking a third of its staff. The robotics lab's funding was cut in half by the end of 2015, but recently Uber passed along a check for $5.5 million that could either be as a ‘thank you’ or ‘sorry’. ‘For you or me to buy a car that can drive autonomously from point A to point B—it’s not even close,' said Herman. 'There are fundamental problems that need to be solved.’  Prior to Uber cleaning house, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) was well-known for its work with autonomous research UBER TO REPLACE HUMAN DRIVERS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE  Uber says the self-driving Volvo XC90 cars will have human backup drivers to begin with, but the move will surely worry the country's 327,000 Uber drivers who will eventually be replaced by autonomous vehicles. Uber co-founder and chief executive officer Travis Kalanick has said that the company's goal is to replace human drivers with driverless vehicles as 'quickly as possible'. The $300million Volvo deal will provide SUVs to Uber and see vehicles outfitted with cameras, lasers and sensors to help them navigate the city's streets. An unspecified number of autonomous Ford Fusions will also pick up passengers. The Volvo has 22 camera lenses, a laser on the roof and laser sensors at the corners. Its cameras, sensors and laser can see more than 100 meters in all directions. Herman told Pearson that the robotics lab bounced back since the failed partnership and now has 115 scientists working for the department. They had ‘plenty of projects that were minimally affected’, he said,  but the group did have to cancel two projects they were working on. Although Herman and his team were affected by the Uber’s controversial move, the ridesharing firm seems to be moving along with their plans. This year, Uber’s souped up autonomous Ford cars were seen through around the streets of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, CMU’s headquarters. And most recently, the firm announced a partnership with Volvo. In February 2015, the two struck a deal to focus on mapping and safety technologies to support Uber’s ride-sharing mission. However, it only took three months before the California firm left the university in a ‘crisis’ by taking a third of its staffUber says it will also start hauling passengers with self-driving Volvo CX90 cars. But the company said they will also have back-up drivers THE RACE TO SELF DRIVING CARS: UBER'S COMPETITION One of Google's self driving prototype 'bubble' cars Google's self-driving car In 2009, Google started the self-driving car project.  The testing fleet includes both modified Lexus SUVs and new prototype vehicles that are designed from the ground up to be fully self-driving.  Google's prototype two-seater 'bubble' cars have buttons to begin and end the drive, but no other controls. An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Under the vision unveiled by Google, passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands. Apple's iCar A concept video reveals ideas for a futuristic-looking Apple car, with a wide dashboard display and smart capabilities. The video from ConceptsiPhone boasts that the 2020 vehicle design is 'more than a car,' with connectivity to other Apple devices. The concept by Luca Wrede shows a build that mirrors the minimalist design common to Apple products. A wraparound dashboard screen shows speed, traffic predictions, and answers calls. The vehicle can pull up Apple Maps, Safari, and Siri, which are indicated all on the interactive dashboard. The concept car can even connect to the Apple Watch.  LEECo's LeSEE China's LeEco has unveiled an electric autonomous vehicle that it says will surpass Tesla's Model S in 'all aspects of performance'. Dubbed LeSEE, the sleek pearly white sedan has memory foam seats, Knight Rider-style voice activation, an automatic driving mode and a steering wheel that folds toward the dash when the car is set to autopilot. This futuristic concept car was engineered to be a 'smart', 'connected' and 'automated self-driving car' and the firm hopes it will set the stage for a fleet of autonomous taxis.  Although Uber's competitor Lyft stated it is dabbling in self-driving taxis, it won't have anything to show for it until next year. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'included customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city' General Motors & Lyft's autonomous Taxis General Motors announced a $500 million investment in Lyft earlier this year as a joint effort to develop a fleet of self-driving taxis. Although the idea seemed like a distant dream, the duo has announced plans for a testing program on public roads by 2017. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'include real customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city'.   In addition to the testing program, Lyft is working on a new app that will be used for the autonomous cars.  The app is still a prototype, but will list the option for an autonomous car and there is a GM OnStar assistant to answer questions or report issues while you're en route to your destination.  Uber says the self-driving Volvo XC90 cars will have human backup drivers to begin with, but the ultimate goal is to replace human drivers with driverless vehicles as 'quickly as possible', said Uber co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick. This will involve Uber adding its own self-developed autonomous driving systems to the Volvo base vehicle. Volvo will use the same base vehicle for the next stage of its own autonomous car strategy, which will involve fully autonomous driving.  ‘Technically, I’m not sure if it’s ready,’ explained Herman. ‘They still have to have engineers in the car. So, for technical reasons, it’s not there.’ ‘But for non-technical reasons, they decided that it’s a good idea to start talking about it.’    Read more: Uber to use autonomous cars to haul people in next few weeks | Daily Mail Online Share or comment on this article e-mail 17 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Xiaomi poised to enter U.S. market in October with Android TV-powered 4K Mi Box Kris Wouk Digital TrendsSeptember 6, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Following its debut at Google I/O earlier this year, Xiaomi's 4K Mi Box could launch as soon as next month, offering 4K and HDR for less than $100, and marking the company's first official product launch in the U.S.More Earlier this year at Google I/O, Xiaomi unveiled its 4K Mi Box, a streaming box along the lines of a Roku, Apple TV, or — aesthetically — the Amazon Fire TV. No release date was announced at the time, though it was slated to be available this year. Now it seems that the box could launch as soon as next month, for less than $100. While we’ve had a chance to look at Xiaomi products from smartphones to robot vacuums, this would be the first product from the Chinese company to officially launch in the U.S. Even if it doesn’t launch in October, it shouldn’t be too long a wait, as a source inside the company told TechCrunch that the Mi Box would launch early in the fourth quarter of 2016. Related: Xiaomi’s new Mi Robot Vacuum really sucks (in a good way) and costs just $250 As first described at Google I/O, the Mi Box features support for 4K Ultra HD resolution and is powered by the Android TV platform, putting it in the same range of devices as the Nvidia Shield TV or the Asus Nexus Player. The Mi Box also supports HDR, putting it in a smaller class of streamers that includes the new products from Roku slated for release this fall. The Mi Box is powered by a quad-core processor paired with a Mali 450 GPU, and features 2 GB RAM and 8 GB storage. The single HDMI 2.0a port sends 4K video to your TV at 60 frames per second, while Dolby Digital Plus support makes for immersive audio. Like other Android TV boxes and the Fire TV Gaming Edition, a game controller is included. Hugo Barra, a former Google executive and current vice president of international for Xiaomi, recently said that the first Xiaomi smartphones will be coming to the U.S. in the “near future,” but that doesn’t narrow itdown. The Mi Box, on the other hand, is a more innocuous way to enter the market and could be Xiaomi’s way of testing the waters. Related: Xiaomi unveils the Amazfit, a fitness-tracking watch and wearable for $120 Whether or not the Mi Box takes off will likely have a lot to do with price. It doesn’t seem to offer much new in the way of features, and the HDR support featured in upcoming Roku models won’t help it. That said, if the price is significantly lower than $100, it could certainly draw in a fair amount of buyers.

Peter Coles is an economist who left Harvard Business School to work at Airbnb in San Francisco. Photo: JASON HENRY, NYT Economists lured to tech companies by big data, big money 1 / 1 Back to Gallery For eight years, Peter Coles had an economist’s dream job at Harvard Business School. His research focused on the design of efficient markets, an important and growing field that has influenced such things as Treasury bill auctions and decisions on who receives organ transplants. He even got to work with Alvin Roth, who won a Nobel in economic science in 2012. But prestige was not enough to keep Coles at Harvard. In 2013, he moved to the Bay Area. He now works at Airbnb, the online lodging marketplace, one of a number of tech companies luring economists with the promise of big sets of data and big salaries. Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal science in its never-ending quest to squeeze more money out of old markets and build new ones. In turn, the economists say they are eager to explore the digital world for fresh insights into timeless economic questions of pricing, incentives and behavior. “It’s an absolute candy store for economists,” Coles said. The pay, of course, is a lot better than you would find in academia, where economists typically earn $125,000 to $150,000 a year. In tech companies, pay for an economist with a doctorate will usually come in at more than $200,000 a year, the companies say. With bonuses and stock grants, compensation can easily double in a few years. Senior economists who manage teams can make even more. Businesses have been hiring economists for years. Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends — topics like recessions and currency exchange rates — and help their employers deal with them. But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they study the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging. Tech firms including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, and up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber, hope that the improved efficiency will translate into more profit. At Netflix, Randall Lewis, an economic research scientist, is finely measuring the effectiveness of advertising. His work also gets at the correlation-or-causation conundrum in economic behavior: What actions occur coincidentally after people see ads, and what actions are most likely caused by the ads? At Airbnb, Coles is researching the marketplace of hosts and guests for insights, both to help build the business and to understand behavior. One study focuses on procrastination — a subject of great interest to behavioral economists — by looking at bookings. Are they last-minute? Made weeks or months in advance? Do booking habits change by age, gender or country of origin? “They are microeconomic experts, heavy on data and computing tools like machine learning and writing algorithms,” said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association for Business Economics. Understanding how digital markets work is getting a lot of attention now, said Hal Varian , Google’s chief economist. But, he said, “I thought it was fascinating years ago.” Varian, 69, is the godfather of the tech industry’s in-house economists. Once a well-known professor at UC Berkeley, Varian showed up at Google in 2002, part time at first, but soon became an employee. He helped refine the AdWords marketplace, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown on search pages, based on the words users type into Google’s search engine. Google’s insight was to avoid giving the best ad placement to the highest bidder. Varian worked to develop a different model for ad placement, calculating the probability that a user will click on an ad and find the ad relevant. It was a classic example of smart market design. Since then, Varian and his team have applied their economic perspective to Google’s ad markets, the company’s unusual auction for its initial public offering, bidding strategies for wireless spectrum, patent auctions and purchases, and models for new businesses like driverless cars. For the moment, Amazon seems to be the most aggressive recruiter of economists. It even has an Amazon Economists website for soliciting resumes. In a video on the site, Patrick Bajari, the company’s chief economist, says the economics team has contributed to decisions that have had multibillion-dollar impacts for the company. Another Amazon jobs site lists openings for economists. As of Friday, there were 34. Seeing this emerging job market, the National Association for Business Economics held its first meeting for technology company economists in April in San Francisco. Another is set for October in Silicon Valley. Academia is also starting to take notice — and adapt. “It’s all happening so fast, it’s hard to keep up,” said Susan Athey , an expert in the economics of technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who is also a consultant to Microsoft. Many economics students also take computer science courses, and some major in both. But a new course this fall at Yale, called Designing the Digital Economy, seeks to blend economics and computer science in the way digital economists do at tech companies. The instructor is Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, and the course will have guest lecturers from Amazon, Pandora and Uber. The course is a pilot project for curriculum change and perhaps a joint degree program focused on digital markets and their design. Dirk Bergemann, chairman of the Yale economics department, explained that economics is concerned with efficiency, prices and incentives, while computer science focused on algorithms and complexity. “In digital marketplaces, you are trying to address both sets of problems,” he said. Weyl predicts that the rise of digital marketplaces in the economy is just getting underway. Uber in ride-hailing and Airbnb in room-renting, he said, may well be just the start of a redefinition of private property, made possible by digital technology. Things, according to Weyl, will increasingly be rented as services instead of owned. That is the long-term vision of driverless cars: When a vehicle just shows up on command, far fewer cars will sit in driveways. Transportation efficiency, resource consumption and industries will all be transformed, he said. The same could be true for household goods, Weyl said. One possible situation: After you use your espresso machine for breakfast, a drone comes to pick it up, and you rent it out for the day. A current market-design challenge for Amazon and Microsoft is their big cloud computing services. These digital services, for example, face a peak-load problem, much as electric utilities do. How do you sell service at times when there is a risk some customers may be bumped off? Run an auction for what customers are willing to pay for interruptible service? Or offer set discounts for different levels of risk? Both Amazon and Microsoft are working on that now. “Economics influences rather than determines decisions,” said Preston McAfee, Microsoft’s chief economist, who previously worked at Google and Yahoo.

Close September 6, 2016 Automakers, pay attention: a new survey suggests that more than half of U.S. consumers would be interested in cars developed by tech giants Google and Apple. The survey was conducted by TECHnalysis Research, which polled 1,000 Americans who (a) currently own a vehicle and (b) plan to purchase another one within the next two years. Among the many questions those folks were asked was whether they'd be interested in buying a car made by Apple, Google, or another technology company. The results were interesting, to say the least: Of those surveyed, 59% said that they would be definitely, seriously, or moderately interested in a car made by Google, while 52% said that they would be definitely, seriously, or moderately interested in cars from Apple. Drilling down, 33% said they were seriously or moderately interested in a car from Google, while 28% expressed serious or moderate interest in an Apple car.  Among early adopters, 12% of respondents said that they would definitely purchase a car from Apple, while 11% said the same of cars made by Google. At the other side of the spectrum, 18% said that they had no interest in cars from Google, while a significantly higher 24% turned up their noses at Apple cars. CHECK OUT: How do you respond when your car is recalled? There's no consensus, it turns out Translation: a majority of U.S. consumers would be willing to consider buying a car made by Google or Apple. (Results for other, unnamed tech firms weren't so high.)  Also, today's consumers are more interested in Google cars than those made by Apple, except for hardcore early adopters. Among that group, Apple has a slight edge--which isn't surprising, given its legions of rabid fans. Implications What does this mean for car companies? At the very least, they ought to sit up and take notice.  Google and Apple don't produce cars--at least not yet. Apple hasn't even acknowledged that it's developing a car, which is possibly the worst-kept secret in tech. As for Google, one bigwig went so far as to say that the company wasn't planning to build its own vehicles, though a few months later, rumors emerged that Google and Ford were creating a new car company. Complicating matters is the fact that Google and presumably Apple are both working on autonomous cars, which make consumers a little wary. If that's all the two firms produce, they'll be selling to a smaller market, at least for the time being, and at least here in the U.S. (In China, though, the sky's the limit.)  However, when it comes to technology, consumers place far more faith in Silicon Valley than in car companies. We've seen that in the infotainment field, where automaker's efforts have yielded lots of frustration (and lawsuits). And a recent study about attitudes toward autonomous cars revealed that consumers want tech firms to develop driving systems, not car companies themselves. That could give Google and Apple a slight edge on the sales floor. Bottom line: automakers can breathe easy for now, but tomorrow could be another story. How would you feel about cars from Google and Apple? Would you prefer one brand over the other? And who should develop autonomous tech anyway? Sound off in the comments below.
