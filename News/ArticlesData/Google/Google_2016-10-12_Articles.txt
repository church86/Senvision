Follow TechnoBuffalo Ahead of the Pixel event, there were murmurs suggesting Google would release new smartwatches imbued with powerful new software. But with no mention of wearables earlier this month and Android Wear 2.0 delayed, the discussion around these devices has been nonexistent. Until now. According to Evan Blass, Google’s two smartphones—Angelfish and Swordfish—are expected to be released early next year. What’s more, they’ll launch with Android Wear 2.0, which means their release will likely coincide with the completion of Google’s Android Wear update. With the rise of Google Assistant, you have to suspect the new AI technology will be a focal point of the upcoming wearable. That would put Assistant on two smartphones, two smartwatches, a messaging app, and Google Home.

Android Wear has been out of the conversation for quite a while now, and with the unexpected delay of its latest update, Google has a lot of work in order to get it back into the conversation. “Made by Google” smartwatches just might be what the doctor ordered.

Photo by Paul Kuroda By Mark Hedin PUBLISHED: October 13, 2016 at 12:15 pm | UPDATED: October 28, 2016 at 6:02 pm OAKLAND — Google unveiled its first Code Next site in East Oakland’s Fruitvale Village, where teens can learn tech in a program developed with MIT. It is Google’s first such venture, though another is planned to open next year in Harlem, N.Y. “We call it a playground, a place for kids to stretch their minds,” said Nilka Thomas, Google’s director of diversity and inclusion. “A lot of folks have been asking, ‘Why Oakland?’ We want to make sure that the next generation of tech leaders come from Oakland — and are black and Latino,” she said. “This is my proudest moment after 12 years at Google,” Thomas added. “They’re going to do things to this industry that we cannot imagine or believe. Their contributions are going to change the world.” Her optimism set the tone for the evening last week, as a couple of hundred people celebrated Code Next’s arrival. The center has been operating since January on a pilot basis, but the build-out was only completed and ready for public viewing after a summer break. By setting neighborhood youngsters on the path to becoming tech innovators, the goal is to diversify the upper echelons of the tech industry and harness the creativity and genius of African-Americans and Latinos, underrepresented in the world of technology. “We are the perfect match for Google, are we not?” Mayor Libby Schaaf asked the gathering of about 200 on the roof of Fruitvale Village on Oct. 6. “We are innovative, and we can even be a little disruptive at times,” she said to chuckles. “It’s the meeting of Google’s tech resources and the genius of Oakland youth. You can create whatever you have in your mind,” the mayor said. Google connected with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop a curriculum for Code Next to inspire kids who may not have naturally gravitated to the field and foster independent, creative thinking once they set their foot in the door. Google research found that 51 percent of black students and 47 percent of Latino students nationwide don’t have access to computer science classes in school, Thomas said. “Without this access, students will be unable to discover an interest in computer science or be inspired by the possibilities that come along with it,” she said. “Code Next fills this gap with a curriculum to get students started and provides opportunities that may otherwise have been out of reach,” Thomas said. Google expects to eventually make the Code Next methodology available to all interested educators as open source material. The program and Fruitvale Village site are entirely funded by Google and offered at no charge. The teenagers are referred by their schools or community organizations such as Black Girls Code, Hack the Hood, Level Playing Field or Unity Council. They have the freedom to pursue projects of their own impulses. Instead of the usual model of lecturing, Code Next sees its approach to working with youngsters as being more of a facilitator. “Teaching ‘at’ students is replaced by teaching them to understand how to become more effective problem solvers,”  said Topper Carew, of MIT’s media lab, who worked with Google in developing the curriculum of “coding, computational thinking, engineering and design principles, in a safe place where one is encouraged to learn from mistakes.” “As long as we continue to fuel the imagination, the potential is immense,” said Errol King, of Google. The space, about 1,500 square feet on the first floor of Fruitvale Village, is divided into a classroom and a lab with 3-D printers, laser cutters and other tech equipment. Architect Danish Kurani showed off the brightly colored space, decorated with images of tech innovators of every ethnicity. “Especially in this neighborhood, how do we inspire these students to want to be the next generation of inventors, computer scientists, innovators, engineers and disrupters?” he said. “They don’t have role models now. We want to make these guys rock stars,” Kurani said of the students. Among the innovators featured on the walls are such non-household names as Marcos Mejia, Anaid Chacon, Uche Nnadi, David Sengeh and Fadel Adid. “Code Next has given us a sense of direction for our young engineer,” said Lisa Cruz, whose son, Elias, participated in this year’s pilot program and spoke of how he sees his dad, also, as an engineer, but one who “did not have the opportunities that I do.” “As we’ve seen our young man blossom, we knew this would be a pathway we would explore,” Lisa Cruz said. “I believe this is what Oakland students need more of.” “We expect to see some of these students in our buildings after graduation,” Carew said.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google Photos is getting even more AI superpowers thanks to a new update. The search giant on Thursday unveiled a slew of features coming to the photo backup service, including one that will detect and fix when an image is sideways. The update—available now for iOS, Android, and the web—is made up of three notable features. The first, as I mentioned, will detect when your photos aren’t oriented correctly and let you easily fix them. You can even fix sideways photos in bulk. Another cool feature involves videos. Google Photos has always made animations from photos, and now the service is applying that same technology to videos, too. According to Google, its algorithms will automatically detect segments of activity and create a short animation that can be shared with friends and family. It’s basically creating little GIFs from your home videos. Lastly, Google says Photos makes it easier to look over recent highlights. “If you take a lot of photos of your child, for example, you may occasionally get a card showing the best ones from the last month,” Google explained. The new features should be available to Google Photos users now. Source Google Topics #Google #Google+ Photos Brandon Russell Brandon Russell enjoys writing about technology and entertainment.

Given that the Pixel phones were codenamed Marlin and Sailfish, we guess there appears to be some kind of sealife-theme that Google is going for. Now according to a post by Evan Blass, he has revealed that Google’s own brand of smartwatches will be launched in Q1 2017 with Android Wear 2.0 in tow. Last we heard, quite a few of the major Android Wear players had no plans to release new smartwatches this year, so it is possible that Google’s efforts could be the newest hardware we’ll be seeing in a while. In terms of specs, we’re not sure what we can expect. From the previous report, not much details were revealed save  for the fact that the Angelfish watch will be a more sporty-looking watch, and Swordfish will be a smaller version. There is also rumored features such as GPS and LTE, but other than that we have no idea what kind of hardware it is packing under the hood. Also we have to wonder if these new smartwatches will receive the same Pixel branding as Google’s recent Pixel smartphones, tablets, and Chrome OS laptops, but we guess we’ll just have to wait until 2017 to find out.

There’s a new Daydream Keyboard app in the Play Store with some very informative screenshots. You can’t use it yet, though. Google notes that the Daydream Keyboard is designed to work inside Daydream apps, and some of them won’t work if you remove the Daydream Keyboard from your device. The keyboard UI looks like the standard Google Keyboard with the alphas in the middle, then a separate panel on the left for numbers and a panel on the right for enter, backspace, and close.

Amy Gesenhues on October 13, 2016 at 5:29 pm More Fact-checking has officially entered the zeitgeist, now getting its own Google News tag. According to a post on the Google Journalism and News blog, Google News articles will include the “Fact check” label if the story includes the schema.org ClaimReview markup or is published by a site that follows “commonly accepted criteria” for fact checks. Today, we’re adding another new tag, “Fact check,” to help readers find fact checking in large news stories. You’ll see the tagged articles in the expanded story box on news.google.com and in the Google News and Weather iOS and Android apps, starting with the US and the UK. Similar to the way the local source tag promotes major local news stories, the Fact check tag will highlight articles that Google News has determined contain fact checks. Google News directed publishers to its Source Label help page for more information on how to mark up articles so that they contain the Fact Check tag: Google News Help for Fact Check tag.

Read more about the stories in today's news: HP Closes In on Lenovo in a Consolidating Global PC Market Intel Launches Its First Branded Drone Google Acquires FameBit to Boost Branded Video Content on YouTube Amazon Unveils Amazon Music Unlimited Streaming Service       Today's topics include the increasingly competitive global PC market and how it is driving top vendors, the launch of Intel's first branded drone, Google's acquisition of FameBit in an effort to enable better branded video content on YouTube and the unveiling of Amazon Music's unlimited streaming service. Lenovo and HP Inc. continue to vie for the top spot in a still-slowing global PC market that is consolidating around a handful of top vendors. Third-quarter numbers released this week by market research firms IDC and Gartner showed that HP is inching closer to market leader Lenovo, with less than a percentage point separating them in the number of systems shipped. "There are two fundamental issues that have impacted PC market results: the extension of the lifetime of the PC caused by the excess of consumer devices, and weak PC consumer demand in emerging markets," Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in a statement. "According to our 2016 personal technology survey, the majority of consumers own, and use, at least three different types of devices in mature markets. Among these devices, the PC is not a high priority device for the majority of consumers, so they do not feel the need to upgrade their PCs as often as they used to. Some may never decide to upgrade to a PC again." Intel officials have cited drones as an important growth market for the chip maker, and the company has been aggressive in getting its technologies--including silicon and software--into devices from other companies. Now Intel is rolling out a drone of its own, with the company's name not only on components inside the unmanned aerial vehicle, but also on the outside. At the InterGeo 2016 show this week, Intel officials unveiled the Falcon 8+, the company's first branded drone. It builds off the work done on the Falcon 8, a commercial drone developed by Ascending Technologies. The octocopter is designed for industrial and commercial work, including inspection, surveying and mapping, and comes with a broad range of capabilities and a sophisticated control unit. Google has acquired marketing firm FameBit in a move the company says will make it easier for brands to work with YouTube creators in pitching products through sponsorships and paid promotions. The acquisition will increase the number of branded content opportunities that are available on YouTube in the form of product placements, sponsorships and promotions. And it will bring in more revenue for content creators on the video-sharing platform, Ariel Bardin, Google's vice president of product management, said in announcing the deal on Google's YouTube blog. Amazon is boosting its streaming music subscription offerings with a new Amazon Music Unlimited service that will provide customers with tens of millions of songs to choose from, an increase from the 2 million songs currently available for free to Amazon Prime customers. The paid service is priced at $7.99 a month or $79.99 a year for Prime members, or $9.99 a month for non-Prime customers, for one account for all of a user's devices. The company is also offering a $3.99 monthly subscription for Amazon Echo users to get music on one Echo, Echo Dot or Amazon Tap device. Echo subscribers who want to expand their service to their other devices can upgrade to a standard plan later at the rates for those plans.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Google is teaming up with Facebook, Pacific Light Data Communication, and TE SubCom to construct a system that’s twice as powerful as the record-holding Faster cable that went live in June, which was said to be 10 million times quicker than a modem. According to the researchers, the new ultra high-capacity system would be able to support 80 million simultaneous HD video conference calls between Asia and North America, and will bring faster speeds and increased security. An 8,000 mile undersea internet cable connecting Los Angeles to Hong Kong is set to be built across the Pacific Ocean by 2018. It will be twice as powerful as the record-holding Faster cable that went live in June, which was said to be 10 million times quicker than a modem THE SUBSEA CABLE  The PLCN will stretch nearly 8,000 miles, from Los Angeles to Hong Kong. It is an ultra high-capacity system, capable of 120-terabits-per-second. This is twice the capabilities of the Faster cable, which connects the US to Japan. Researchers say the new would be able to support 80 million simultaneous HD video conference calls between Asia and North America. Plans for the Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) were announced on the Google Cloud Platform Blog. The cable will be the highest capacity trans-Pacific system, with a capacity of 120 terabits-per-second, and is the sixth undersea cable the Google has taken part in. It’s hoped that the PLCN will be operational in 2018. ‘From the get-go, PLCN is designed to accommodate evolving infrastructure technology, allowing us to independently choose network equipment and refresh optical technology as it advances,’ the Google team wrote.

Share this article Share 289 shares ‘Most importantly, PLCN will bring lower latency, more security, and greater bandwidth to Google users in the APAC region.’ Along with this, the firm says it will expand Google’s reach in Asia for Google Cloud and G Suite users. Just months ago, Google revealed the completion of its subsea cable system that stretches from the United States to Japan.    The new system will be twice as powerful as the record-holding Faster cable that went live in June, pictured, which was said to be 10 million times quicker than a modem THE 5,600 MILE CABLE The Faster subsea cable system has 60TBps total capacity – 10 million times faster than a cable modem. It transmits multiple colours of light over various frequencies, using a repeater to reenergize the light roughly every 37 miles. It has landing points in Oregon, in the US, and Chiba and Mie, in Japan, but connectivity will extend along the West Coast of the US and to major cities in Japan and other Asian locations.  The $300 million ‘Faster’ cable system is backed by six companies, including Google, and runs through the Pacific Ocean from Oregon to Chiba and Mie.  The system currently has a greater total capacity than any other undersea cable, Google SVP of Technical Infrastructure Urs Hölzle revealed in a blog post. It can deliver 60 terabits per second of bandwidth 5,600 miles across the ocean, bringing high speed connection to users in the US and Japan. ‘Internet users and our customers in Japan today should notice things seem to be moving a bit…FASTER,’ Hölzle wrote. ‘Today, our FASTER subsea cable between Japan and the U.S. officially entered into service.’ It has landing points in Oregon, in the US, and Chiba and Mie, in Japan, but the benefits won’t be limited only to these areas. The submarine cable system has extended connections along the West Coast, allowing it to cover Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Portland, and Seattle. And, this connectivity will reach many major cities in Japan and other Asian locations. The subsea cable system can deliver 60 terabits per second of bandwidth 5,600 miles across the ocean, bringing high speed connection to users in the US and Japan. It has landing points in Oregon, in the US, and Chiba and Mie, in Japan, but the benefits won’t be limited only to these areas The Faster Cable system was built through the collaboration of six international companies and NEC Corporation. It transmits multiple colours of light over various frequencies, using a repeater to reenergize the light roughly every 37 miles. Construction was first announced in August 2014. ‘From the very beginning of the project, we repeatedly said to each other, ‘faster, Faster and FASTER,’ and at one point it because the project name, and today it becomes a reality, said Hiromitsu Todokoro, Chairman of the FASTER Management Committee. ‘This is the outcome of six members’ collaborative contribution and expertise together with NEC’s support. Along with this achievement, Google will open its Google Cloud Platform region in Tokyo later this year, for a faster and more secure public cloud, according to Hölzle. Faster isn’t the only subsea cable system, the SVP explained, but it is the most powerful. Hundreds of submarine cables connect different areas of the word, to ‘collectively form an important backbone that helps run the Internet.’    Read more: Internet users and our customers in Japan today should notice things seem to be… Google Cloud Platform Blog: New undersea cable expands capacity for Google APAC customers and users Share or comment on this article e-mail 289 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

The Don Claims Search Engine Is Biased Opinion 2 0 0 October 13, 2016 Donald Trump’s Anti-Hillary Clinton Statements: Is Google A Liberal Conspiracy? The Don Claims Search Engine Is Biased Kevin Carneglia The following article is entirely the opinion of Kevin Carneglia and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr. Donald Trump has been known for making larger-than-life claims, but this one takes the cake. Trump claimed recently that Google was purposely biased against him while hiding all negative online search results about Hillary Clinton. It’s true that Google is a liberal company, but is Trump being conspired against by the search engine giant? CNN.com mentions that the conspiracy first appeared in June 2016, when a viral video by pop culture site SourceFeed accused Google of changing search results to aid Clinton. So, what is the proof that Google has or hasn’t done what Trump suggests? Donald Trump speaks to supporters at a rally in West Palm Beach, FL, October 13, 2016. [Image By Joe Raedle/Getty Images] A quick search for “Hillary Clinton stealing” actually does bring up negative articles about Clinton. Searching “Hillary Clinton bad publicity” also shows some of the candidate’s dark side. From this, it’s pretty clear that Trump is not being discriminated against. This isn’t the first time Trump has had a run-in with a major tech titan. As CNET.com learned, Trump has previously called on Apple to manufacture products in the US. Trump has been called a hypocrite several times for manufacturing his own merchandise in foreign markets while calling for American companies to manufacture at home. Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at the Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in Lakeland, FL. [Image By Joe Raedle/Getty Images] Trump also reported on Twitter that every poll had his campaign ahead of Hillary’s while they clearly did not. In fact, most major polls favor the Democratic Party nominee by at least three to four points. A CNN poll reported that Trump currently has an eight percent chance of getting to the White House. So, what’s a slowly-but-surely drowning nominee to do? Up until this point, Trump has thrived on turning the media’s heads towards what he has to say. If he can do that again in the election, he may still have a chance for a comeback. Both sides of the aisle seem to think Trump cannot redeem himself, Google conspiracy or not. Republicans are abandoning Donald faster than you can say “Make America Great Again,” and Michelle Obama has called his comments on women “intolerable.” Even some within the GOP ranks have called for the candidate to step down. "Now is the time for all of us to stand up and say enough is enough. This has got to stop right now." —First Lady Michelle Obama on Trump A photo posted by Hillary Clinton (@hillaryclinton) on Oct 13, 2016 at 10:37am PDT That leaves one very big white elephant in the room, and that is Gary Johnson. The Libertarian candidate has come from seemingly out of nowhere, offering a third choice to those fed up with both candidates. Could Trump’s loss be Johnson’s gain? Donald Trump also attacked a writer from People Magazine on Twitter after she claimed he’d sexually assaulted her. You can practically hear him yelling as he tweets, “Why didn’t [the writer of the People article] mention the ‘incident’ in her story. Because it didn’t happen!” The GOP presidential candidate has claimed that mainstream media is also against him. On Twitter, he slammed the “dishonest” media for giving little coverage of Clinton’s incriminating e-mails, as exposed by WikiLeaks. He also accused CNN of giving Hillary questions in advance of her debates against Bernie Sanders. Trump has said in recent weeks that Bernie got a raw deal from the DNC, and he took aim at DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2016 In the light of the controversy, Trump’s running mate Mike Pence is standing by him. The Indiana Governor posted a tweet that claimed Hillary might have released classified information concerning the capture of Osama Bin Laden. He also asserted that Trump’s movement is about rebuilding America. #AmericaFirst #ImWithYou A photo posted by Donald Trump (@trump_2016) on Sep 4, 2016 at 10:05am PDT The GOP nominee has continuously denied the allegations made against him about sexual assault. He explains the incidents away as having never happened and denies many of the misogynistic comments the media has attributed to him. Additionally, he has accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting several women, some of whom were present at the 2nd Presidential Debate this past Sunday. The woman, however, accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting them long before Mr. Trump decided to run for president. Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the "incident" in her story. Because it did not happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2016 What do you think? Is there a conspiracy by Google and/or the mainstream media to shut the GOP nominee out?

It’s the first paper from a Canadian to look at Google data for economic prediction purposes, and the first anywhere to look at the specific issue of recessions. And it’s created much media buzz. Just hours after the report’s release, the story was picked up by the Canadian Press and appeared in Maclean’s, the Toronto Star, and the Huffington Post, Victoria Times-Colonist and Winnipeg Free Press. Dr. Tkacz also spoke with radio stations in Calgary and Vancouver, did a call-in show on CFAX radio based in Victoria, BC, spoke with a reporter from the Wall Street Journal's "Canada Real Time," which ran its own original story about the paper (http://blogs.wsj.com/canadarealtime/2013/09/05/could-google-be-an-economic-magic-8-ball/?KEYWORDS=Tkacz), and published an op-ed on this topic in the Globe and Mail: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economy-lab/how-google-trends-and-card-payments-can-tell-the-economys-temperature/article14109457/ In the report, Dr. Tkacz found a relationship between Google searches and economic activity when he looked at the 2008 recession. Knowing that many people are keying in search terms such as “recession” and “jobs” can give an indication of economic changes as they’re happening, he says, and the data can also help policy makers respond more quickly to these changes. "New sources of electronically recorded data are both timely and reflect the real-time intentions of millions (or billions) of agents," says Dr. Tkacz, who has expertise in short-run economic forecasting, and has been working for several years on innovative data sets to study the movements of the economy through debit and credit card transactions. "Most policymakers and economists failed to predict the last recession because of the lag in traditional economic data. I look at the search data in Google Trends, as well as electronic payments data, to see if the recession signals were there in real time. " He says economic indicator data can often lag several months behind, making it hard to forecast future trends. “It’s like trying to predict the weather when you only have temperatures for two days ago,” he says. “This report looks at how we can get more timely information. Getting a more timely measurement of the economy is the ultimate objective here.” Going forward, there’s still much work to be done to understand how to best use and optimize the data, he says.   Start Your Journey Talk To Us Tour Campus Apply Now News StFX students win CUSID East Novice Debate championship November 9, 2016 The U4 League ─ Acadia, Bishop’s, Mount Allison, and StFX ─ is now the Maple League of Universities November 9, 2016 StFX officially launches Sexual Violence Policy November 8, 2016 See all Recent News Events The Allan J.

Google starts highlighting fact-checks in News Posted Oct 13, 2016 by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story HP plans 3,000 to 4,000 job cuts over the next three years Today Google added a new “fact-check” tag to its popular Google News service. The site aggregates popular timely news from multiple sources and has traditionally grouped them with tags like “opinion,” “local source” and “highly cited.” Now readers can see highlighted fact-checks right next to trending stories. The company cites the growing prominence of fact-checking sites as one of the reasons for creating the tag. Content creators will be able to add the new fact-check tag to posts themselves using a finite set of pre-defined source labels.   ClaimReview from Schema.org will be used to compile and organize stories offering factual background. The Schema community builds markups for structured data on the internet. The group is sponsored by Google but also has support from Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex.  Casual readers in the U.S. and U.K. can find nuggets of fact within the expanded view of news stories on web and mobile versions of the service. Fingers crossed the new tool doesn’t result in stories claiming that the earth is really flat rising to the top of our feeds. On a support page, Google explains that it holds the power to intervene if posts are improperly tagged as fact-checks. “Please note, that if we find sites not following those criteria for the ClaimReview markup, we may, at our discretion, either ignore that site’s markup or remove the site from Google News.” This may not prevent false stories from rising up in Google News, but it will make it a lot harder. It doesn’t appear that very many fact-check stories have propagated yet on Google News. We couldn’t find any in a quick visit to the site, but given the timeliness of the presidential election in the U.S., we can only expect the system to be put through its paces in the coming weeks.

Oct 13, 2016 Share Tweet 0 Subscribe to Complex Video via YouTube Lil Wayne's manager, Cortez Bryant, stopped by the Rap Radar podcast and spoke at length about the issues with Cash Money Records for the first time, revealing that Tha Carter V was actually supposed to drop on Google for free, but the deal was killed by label founder's Birdman and Slim. "We were ready to put our Carter V. We put out 'Believe Me' as a single before we put out the record… it's never been a situation [with Cash Money] where I would have to worry about anything financial. They were great with the checks because we'd come with a plan, I'd lay it out to them, they cut the check...This time, once we put it out, the check didn't come." Related Listen To Lil Wayne's 'Free Weezy Album' On Tidal Lil Wayne Is Reportedly Refusing to Allow Birdman and Cash Money to Release 'Tha Carter V' Lil Wayne Is Suing Birdman and Cash Money Records for $51 Million According to Cortez, they had negotiated a deal with Google after "Believe Me" became a hit single. "We had a deal cut with Google where they were going to back the album and put it out for free. When I presented it to Slim and Baby, they didn't get it and the label was against it," admitted Cortez, who says the pair didn't get what it meant to stream the album."They basically told me 'Yo, we can't put the album out.' When I had to tell Wayne that, he was like 'What? You can't stop me, you can't hold me back. I got to tell my fans because they don't deserve this and I'm 'bout to air it out. Before I got off the phone to call his lawyer to let him know we was about to have some shit, TMZ was on the other line." Aside from talk of Wayne's status, Bryant also hinted that Drake has "2-3" albums coming out this year, which could mean his collaboration with Kanye West.  Lil Wayne's manager says Drake is releasing 3-4 albums this year: https://t.co/cY6KV7EFn6 pic.twitter.com/5MJvUefe0q — The6Track (@the6Track) October 14, 2016 From there, things escalated quickly as fans called on Birdman to "free Wayne" and Wayne released Free Weezy exclusively on Tidal and other streaming services. For Cortez's part, he lays out his thoughts on the situation clearly, explaining that he thinks the label got stuck in a bad way where they had potentially played with too much of the money and didn't have the funds to pay their hugely successful artists when it came time.

Rumors have suggested that Google has a couple of smartwatches in the works, too, and now we may know when we’ll see them. Google’s smartwatches will launch in Q1 2017, according to serial leaker Evan Blass. When they launch, it’s expected that they’ll run Android Wear 2.0, which Google recently pushed into early 2017. A report from earlier this year spilled some other details on Google’s smartwatches. There will reportedly be two models, with the Angelfish sporting a 43.5mm diameter and the Swordfish measuring 42mm. The Angelfish will have GPS, LTE, and a heart-rate monitor, says the Android Police source, while the Angelfish will lack GPS and LTE. Both devices are expected to have Google Assistant support. There’s no shortage of Android Wear smartwatches currently on the market, both from mobile companies like Samsung and Motorola as well as traditional watch makers like Nixon and TAG Hauer. Google’s rumored smartwatches will likely be a big deal when they launch, though, because like the new Pixel and Pixel XL, they’ll be the first Android Wear watches from Google.

The deviation from the Nexus line is being marketed as the first Google-branded phones. Well, the Nexus was also known as a Google brand so any Nexus phone is also a Google phone. But then the Pixel and Pixel XL are being hailed as phones by Google as described in two new ads published on YouTube before the commercial release. The videos show the Pixel with references such as ‘Together by you’ and ‘Crush by you’. The first one minute ad somehow tells us the Pixel can bring people more together than ever. From a simple search engine, Google has evolved into something better–one that brings people together. It’s a description for what the phone can do. That is, to bring people together in one place. We’re still not sure about this ‘Crush by you’ but it features a couple “falling in love”. Maybe they like each or one has a crush on the other but they appear to be real lovers already so more than just a crush. That’s too many pink balloons to be preparing for your “crush”. Or is this just about finding the one? Watch the video and share below what you think about the ads.

Thursday, October 13, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Why Does Siri Seem So Dumb? Walt Mossberg (MacRumors): Google Now, on the same Apple devices, using the same voice input, answered every one of these questions clearly and correctly. And that isn’t even Google’s latest digital helper, the new Google Assistant. If you try most of these broken examples right now, they’ll work properly, because Apple fixed them after I tweeted screenshots of most of them in exasperation, and asked the company about them. […] For instance, when I asked Siri on my Mac how long it would take me to get to work, it said it didn’t have my work address — even though the “me” contact card contains a work address and the same synced contact card on my iPhone allowed Siri to give me an answer. Similarly, on my iPad, when I asked what my next appointment was, it said “Sorry, Walt, something’s wrong” — repeatedly, with slightly different wording, in multiple places on multiple days. But, using the same Apple calendar and data, Siri answered correctly on the iPhone. Ruffin Bailey: Spend ten million (he said figuratively) and get the best QA staff in the business, and make sure there's no silo making QAing app interactions an issue. If Maps borks like this, the QA team “for Maps” has to be able to hold Siri and Contacts (or whatever else) accountable. No software ships until this blocking bug is fixed. John Gruber: Indeed, Siri now knows the date and time of the next U.S. presidential debate, but where Siri fundamentally falls apart is its inability to maintain context and chain together multiple commands. […] These sort of glaring inconsistencies are almost as bad as universal failures. The big problem Apple faces with Siri is that when people encounter these problems, they stop trying. It feels like you’re wasting your time, and makes you feel silly or even foolish for having tried. I worry that even if Apple improves Siri significantly, people will never know it because they won’t bother trying because they were burned so many times before. In addition to the engineering hurdles to actually make Siri much better, Apple also has to overcome a “boy who cried wolf” credibility problem. Nick Heer: I think the inconsistencies are worse than outright failure. The inability to answer a query implies a limitation which, while not ideal, is understandable. Inconsistency, on the other hand, makes Siri feel untrustworthy. If I can’t reliably expect the same result with basic queries that are almost identical, I’m much less likely to find it dependable. Kirk McElhearn: I pointed out similar problems in a Macworld article in August. For me, Siri is a waste of time. The only thing Siri consistently does correctly for me is set timers. I keep trying to use it to add reminders and am usually frustrated. Either the phone can’t connect to Siri, or it mis-parses what I said. It’s easier to use my finger to create a new action in OmniFocus and then to use the dictation button on the keyboard. iOS is pretty good at transcribing what I say. The problem is that interpreting it is unreliable. And that’s why I rarely even try to ask it more complicated questions. See also: Daniel Jalkut on Siri logging, David Spark’s Dragon Professional review. Update (2016-10-14): Stephen Hackett: Siri should feel like a living, growing platform and it just doesn’t. Even SiriKit, which allows developers to build plugins for the service, doesn’t get Apple far enough down the road. This is a platform vendor problem, and not one a handful of apps can solve. Update (2016-10-17): David Sparks: Why does it take an article by a popular journalist to get these things fixed? I feel as if Siri needs more attention. I don’t think the underlying technology is as bad as most people think but it is these little failures that causes everyone to lose faith. Update (2016-10-20): Nick Heer: I think it’s important to keep bringing it up because I think Siri is currently fundamentally flawed in its design. […] More worrying for me is that the user interface component of Siri — a field where Apple typically excels — simply isn’t good enough. Dictation Google Now iOS iOS 10 Mac macOS 10.12 Sierra Reminders Siri 5 Comments 5 Comments Peter N Lewis October 13, 2016 9:26 PM Unfortunately even setting the alarms in Siri does not do correctly. Try this: Create an alarm for 9:43, repeating every Tuesday, and turn it off. Now: "Siri, set an alarm for 9:43" - it simply turns on the 9:43 alarm which wont go off until Tuesday, not today or tomorrow as expected. Chucky October 14, 2016 2:43 AM Peter, if I'm parsing your results correctly, were I a human assistant, I'd act exactly as Siri is doing in this particular case... charles October 14, 2016 3:07 AM Chucky: I agree with Peter. If I say "an alarm", the indefinite article implies a different alarm, not the pre-existing one, so Siri should create a new one. If I say "Switch on the 9:43 alarm", and assuming I only have one set up, then yes, I should not expect it to go off until Tuesday. Chucky October 14, 2016 5:12 AM "Chucky: I agree with Peter." Yeah. I understand now. I misunderstood his comment. BCG November 1, 2016 1:31 PM I'm tired of the Siri bug that has persisted since iOS 8 (it was fine in iOS 7, IIRC) where if she misunderstands your command to create a reminder, and then you either manually correct it (or now with iOS 10) select one of her alternate suggestions, it STILL creates TWO reminders... the misinterpretation, and the correction. I have filed this bug on Bug Reporter, reported it via Apple's Feedback page, and even emailed Craig Federighi and Alex Acero about it (they both responded). Yet, here we are at iOS 10.1 and it still exists. It makes me wonder if Apple even cares anymore if they are letting simple bugs like this make it through the development process of THREE different versions of iOS and multiple bug reports and emails to SVPs... and still not fixing it. Like why would you provided a mechanism to correct Siri's input, but then not actually honor it when the user chooses the corrected version?

The new tool is available at https://search.google.com/search-console/amp and from within the Google Search Console. The tool works on your mobile device and uses Google’s “live web-search infrastructure” to analyze the AMP page with the real Googlebot — so the result is done in real time. It tests the validity of the AMP markup and structured data on the page related to AMP. If issues are found, you will be able to click on them to see details. Even the line in the source-code will be highlighted, showing you exactly where the error is. It even has links to show you a live preview of how this page may appear in Google’s search results.

For the first time, Google has been unusually aggressive with the promotion of its smartphones. And why not, the Pixel smartphones are first ever in-house designed, produced and manufactured smartphones. In a similar bid to show off the Pixel phones to Indians, Google took full page ads in a number of national newspapers, touting the smartphones’ new AI-based Assistant feature.

Google is now adding a “Fact check” label to verified articles in the US and UK on the web and mobile apps. Google began labeling types of articles in News with In-Depth, Opinion, and Wikipedia tags seven years ago to help readers quickly differentiate between different content types. The addition of a Local Source tag in May was meant to surface local coverage of major news stories that would otherwise be overshadowed by bigger publications. With its latest tag, Google News is aiming to help readers find fact checking in large news stories. Publishers who create fact checks and want the label are advised to use schema.org ClaimReview markup. Google will also be looking for sites that “follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks” and reserves the right to ignore a site’s markup or remove the site: Discrete claims and checks must be easily identified in the body of fact check articles. Readers should be able to understand what was checked, and what conclusions were reached. Analysis must be transparent about sources and methods, with citations and references to primary sources. The organization must be nonpartisan, with transparent funding and affiliations. It should examine a range of claims in its topic area, instead of targeting a single person or entity. Article titles must indicate that a claim is being reviewed, state the conclusions reached, or simply frame that the article’s contents consist of fact checking. The new Fact check label is now live in the US and UK on news.google.com and in the Google News & Weather for Android and iOS.

Related: We tested all the most popular smartwatches to find the uncontested best So with all that in mind, here are 25 of our favorite Android Wear apps, in no particular order.  Some of these are apps that load dedicated versions to your smartwatch, while others are merely apps you may already have but will load special Android Wear versions to your smartwatch. Either way, they’re all must-haves for your watch. Stocard stocard-gallMore Running out of space on your keychain due to the many little loyalty and membership cards you lug around? Stocard not only lets you digitize all those cards so they’re accessible in a single mobile app, it even works with your Android Wear watch to display them. This means you just need to let the cashier scan your watch, instead of physical cards or your smartphone, to collect your rewards or access your gym. Amazon App Store Google Play Google Slides Google SlidesMore Here is a new incentive to use the latest version of Google Slides for your presentations: You can now use your Android Wear smartwatch to both timekeep and remotely control your slides. The only catch is that you need to first “cast” your slides to a Chromecast-enabled display, or present them in a video call, before your watch will transform into a slick presentation remote. Google Play If by IFTTT If by IFTTTMore Read More Let’s be real, app developers aren’t mind readers who know exactly what functions you need, so why not create your own with IF by IFTTT? Short for the programming lingo “If This Then That,” this meta-app lets you create “recipes” that link two unrelated apps in order to create an action. For example, you can tell the app to send a copy of every photo you take with your phone to your Android Wear watch. Amazon App Store Google Play Tinder Tinder appMore Start planning for your hot date tonight by swiping right or left through Tinder — on your wrist. With the dating app bringing its features to Android Wear, you’ll be able to check out potential dates in your area, see notifications on new matches, as well as respond to their messages, right on your watch. Just to make it extra easy to access the app, you can even use your voice to tell Google to open Tinder on your smartwatch. Amazon App Store Google Play Medisafe Meds & Pill Reminder Medisafe Meds & Pill ReminderMore Everyone can use a gentle reminder to take their medication, whether you’re taking vitamins or caring for someone with a strict pill schedule. You’ll need to spend a bit of time entering every pill — including its color and shape — into the mobile app the first time you open it, but it’ll be well worth it when your watch buzzes and notifies you of the exact pill and dosage you need to take. No more excuses for forgetting, or taking the wrong meds! Amazon App Store Google Play Shazam ShazamMore Don’t miss the opportunity to identify a song simply because you couldn’t whip out your smartphone fast enough! Now that Shazam fully supports Android Wear, you only need to hold up your wrist to “Shazam” a song. Your smartwatch will even showcase the lyrics, so you can sing along to your new anthem without missing a beat. Amazon App Store Google Play PixtoCam for Android Wear ($2) PixtoCam for Android WearMore PixtoCam turns your Android Wear watch into a remote viewfinder for your mobile camera, so that you can capture timed group photos and other tricky shots with greater ease. The app is the most feature-rich camera app out there — at least for smartwatches — and lets you toggle between the front and rear cameras, control the level of zoom, and trigger both still photos and videos directly from your wrist. You also get a live view of the shot before you snap the image. Google Play Stellio Music Player Stellio Music PlayerMore Looking for a media player that does more than just “pause” or “play” your music or podcast? The Stellio Music Player is one of the few smartwatch-compatible media apps that lets you adjust the volume from your wrist. Other on-screen controls allow you to skip and return to previous track, along with view the album art and title of the track that is currently playing. Amazon App Store Google Play Water Drink Reminder Water Drink ReminderMore Despite the many benefits of drinking plenty of water each day — clearer skin, weight loss, etc. — most of us just aren’t downing enough H2O. That’s where the Water Drink Reminder app comes in. The app knows how much you need to drink at regular intervals throughout the day because it actually calculates your ideal intake amount based on your weight, day length, and cup size. When it’s time for more water, your watch will provide you with a gentle reminder. Google Play InstaWeather Instaweather appMore Always want the weather at a glance? InstaWeather is a smartwatch app for your Android Wear devices that offers more than just an app for checking on the weather. It also includes specially-crafted watch faces that share the latest weather alongside the time of day. You can not only see the most intricate of weather information right from your watch face, but some premium watch faces will even show the latest radar images, giving you a clear look at what’s coming. The app will notify you when it’s raining nearby to give you a heads up about inclement weather. Google Play Calendar for Android Wear Calendar app for Android WearMore This might be a crazy choice for an app, but Android Wear’s own agenda service is only good at seeing what’s coming up for that day. If you want to see what’s happening later in the week, or just catch a glance at a calendar to see what day is when, then you’ll want to download Calendar for Android Wear. This app offers a simple Agenda service, but more importantly, it’s an easy way to glance at a full calendar without taking out your whole phone. Google Play Coffee Coffee app for Android WearMore Android Wear, by default, integrates with the Messenger app that comes with your Android device already, but we find that app to be a bit lacking in functionality. Coffee is a jolted up version of the default messenger app that offers pre-written responses for when you need to reply quickly without speaking to your watch. Coffee also supports quick SMSing to give you a list of popular contacts — all without touching your smartphone. Google Play Feel The Wear Feel The Wear appMore Another necessary enhancement for your Android Wear smartwatch is Feel The Wear. This app changes up the rather boring default vibration your smartwatch will have for most notifications and messages. Instead, you can customize a special vibration “tone” for all sorts of apps and notifications to tell apart your messages without even glancing at your watch. Google Play Find My Phone Find My Phone appMore Ever lose your phone? It’s easy to forget about it when heading out for work some days, and now your watch will remind you about the lost device. Find My Phone will automatically vibrate your watch if it disconnects from your phone, so you don’t end up stranded without it. If you lost your phone in a room and Find My Phone can detect it, then you can also ring the phone from your smartphone to discover wherever you last left the device. Google Play Eat24 Eat24 appMore Eat24 is an easy way to grab some food. It offers up a list of local restaurants that support pickup or delivery to your home. In case you’re feeling especially lazy while making an order or waiting for your Eat24 order to arrive, now there’s an Android Wear app to help simplify the process. You can look at recent orders, get notifications on your deliveries, and other information at a glance from the app. Amazon App Store Google Play Wear Mini Launcher Wear Mini Launcher appMore Wear Mini Launcher makes it a whole lot easier to find things on your smartwatch. Rather than scroll through apps one by one as you’d do with the default drawer, Wear Mini Launcher is a hexagonal way to navigate your apps. It also gives you a way to quickly swipe over for other quick settings, such as your smartwatch’s brightness level, alarm modes, and other settings. Google Play Sleep as Android Sleep As Android appMore Sleep as Android is an extension of the same, awesome sleeping technology in the regular Sleep as Android app. Just as the original app uses your phone to track your noise and movement as you sleep, Sleep as Android for your smartwatch allows you to track sleeping patterns without leaving your smartphone on the bed. That way, you can keep your smartphone charging while your Android smartwatch serves as a sleep monitor for the smartphone’s tracking technology. Google Play Lyft Lyft for Android Wear appMore Lyft is by far one of the most wrist-friendly ways to hail a cab. Lyft is already a nifty app for ride-sharing, giving you immediate access to arranging a ride, whether you’re just trying to get downtown or looking to get home after a long night out. Now, you can do it all from your wrist by simply tapping for a ride, and tracking your driver without taking out a smartphone or a wallet. Google Play Authenticator Plus Authenticator Plus appMore If you use two-factor authentication for your Google account, then Authenticator Plus is a must-have, hands down. This app keeps a copy of your two-factor keys right on your smartwatch, linked through the Authenticator Plus app on your smartphone. This means you can get two-factor authentication codes without even taking out your smartphone, glancing at your watch discretely and easily. Your codes will be always in reach, and with two-factor authentication your accounts will remain safer than ever. Amazon App Store Google Play LevelUp LevelUp appMore LevelUp is a unique way to pay friends, buy groceries, and handle all sorts of other payment needs. The payment service processes everything through QR codes, as opposed to NFC or other technologies. This means LevelUp works on just about anything with a screen, including your Android Wear smartwatch. You can easily get a QR code loaded right onto your smartwatch, so you can pay without breaking out the wallet or the smartphone. Just a wave of your wrist, and you’re done. Google Play Google Keep Google Keep appMore Keep is probably one of the best note and checklist apps out there. Designed for quick reminders and shopping lists, Keep is a Google note service that brings those same lists and information right to your wrist. When the smartwatch is asleep, most devices with an OLED screen will continue showing the list, making it easy to track your progress in the supermarket without constantly checking a smartphone or written list on paper. Amazon App Store Google Play 2048 Android Wear 2048 Android Wear appMore If you’re ever bored and want some entertainment without digging out your phone, 2048 Android Wear has you covered. There’s no other way to explain it: It’s 2048, just on a much smaller screen. You can swipe around numbers to reach the grand score of 2048, or at least distract yourself for a few minutes on the bus or subway. Amazon App Store Google Play Invaders Invaders app for Android WearMore Another fun game to pass the time is Invaders, a remake of the classic Space Invaders game — except now on your smartwatch. This operates more or less just like a generic Space Invaders clone. If you’ve got a few minutes and don’t want to attract too much suspicion, this app might be a nice time waster on your wrist. Amazon App Store Google Play Wear Audio Recorder Wear Audio Recorder appMore If you’ve ever had to keep track of a conversation, or just needed to give yourself a verbal note, then you’ve probably thought about digging out your smartphone to make an audio recording. Instead, Wear Audio Recorder brings that very functionality to your wrist. With the app you can quickly record and save audio messages, whether it’s a reminder to buy milk later, or an important conversation that you need to record. Either way, it’s a simple, easy tool for your smartwatch’s arsenal. Google Play Wear Store for Wear Apps Wear Store for Android WearMore Last but not least, we have to note how difficult it is to use Google’s own Android Wear app store. A lot of apps get lost in the confusion, since some are unique, Android Wear apps, and others are regular apps with additional Android Wear functionality. The Wear Store is a third-party store available for download that helps sort through all of that chaos. Compared to the Android Wear store, this app store is far more useful for finding new Android smarwatch apps, and is a much better way to get reviews, hear feedback, and stay tuned to the latest and greatest smartwatch apps launching every week. Google Play So there’s a look at the many awesome apps all around for Android Wear devices everywhere. These are all must-haves for your smartwatch, and will help give your smartwatch all kinds of new, important uses in day-to-day life. If you’ve got your own favorite apps, feel free to let us know in the comments! We might add your favorite apps to this list in the near future.

Enroll Now > Home News (MediaWire) Training Events Support Poynter Careers About Contact Fact-Checking Google News now has a “Fact Check” tag By Alexios Mantzarlis • October 13, 2016 Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) SOURCE Google Google announced today that it will flag fact-checking articles in Google News. A search for news about Donald Trump, for example, yields the following results: The links tagged as "fact checks" are from websites that apply a corresponding label to their code, ClaimReview markup. Google will also flag fact-checking content from "sites that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks," though these too will need to use the ClaimReview markup. This is currently in use by fewer than 10 domains. A Google spokesperson wouldn't confirm the full list of websites; searches for the moment yield results from PolitiFact and Full Fact. In the announcement, Google Head of News Richard Gingras writes that the organization is "excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin." Fact-checking guru Bill Adair called this move a "huge step" on Twitter. This tagging may well lead to increased traffic for fact-checking outlets, which are already seeing record growth in the United States. Whether it will help "crowd out" false claims on the internet remains to be seen. Whatever else happens, it seems to indicate a growing commitment to accuracy, at least in principle, from a Silicon Valley giant. Perhaps others, too, will take heed. Update: the article was updated to reflect that PolitiFact and Full Fact are among the websites whose fact checks are tagged by Google News. What to read next AUTHOR INFORMATION Alexios Mantzarlis Alexios Mantzarlis joined Poynter to lead the International Fact-Checking Network in September of 2015. In this capacity he writes about fact-checking, trains fact-checkers (online and offline) and organizes conferences on fact-checking. He previously served as Managing Editor of Pagella Politica and FactCheckEU, respectively Italy's main political fact-checking website and the EU's first multilingual crowd-checking project. He has presented fact-checking segments on Italian TV and led seminars on fact-checking around the world.

Photograph: Joe Raedle, Justin Sullivan Jemima Kiss in San Francisco @jemimakiss Thursday 13 October 2016 16.00 EDT Last modified on Sunday 13 November 2016 09.56 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger This article is 1 month old In the midst of a highly charged presidential election, where fact and fiction have frequently become confused, Google News has introduced a new fact check feature in search results for news stories. Launched today, fact check will now appear as a label among news search results, alongside other established labels such as opinion, local source and highly cited. Google News algorithmically connects fact-checking articles with live news stories partly based on an established process called Claim Review. Google says that sites meeting the definition of a fact-checking service can apply to have their service included. Debate fact-check: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's claims reviewed Read more In a blogpost promoting the new feature, Google said: “We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin.” Facebook, despite its increasingly critical role in the distribution of news, has yet to deploy any fact-checking feature. Research by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in June 2016 found that Facebook was the primary source of news for 18- to 24-year-olds. After sacking its trending topics news team, the social media site was at the center of a storm when its algorithm started promoting fake news. In Google News, fact check labels are visible in the expanded story box on the Google News site, on both the iOS and Android apps, and roll out for users in the US and UK first. The timing of the new label is significant, contributing to an unprecedented US presidential election where both sides have been accused of misrepresenting facts. Some commentators have used the term “post-truth” to describe the current state of political discussion. There are 26 days, and one remaining debate, until the US electorate votes on 8 November – not 28 November, as Donald Trump incorrectly stated this week. • This article was amended on 19 October 2016 to state that the Reuters Institute, not Pew, was the source of the June 2016 research.

INNOVATE Google, Facebook Partner Up to Deliver Crazy Fast Internet An 8,000-mile cable will be the most powerful to ever span the Pacific. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a reporter for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Reporter, Inc.@wheresKR WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Google and Facebook are forming a powerful alliance. The two companies are going in on a project to build an internet cable that spans the floor of the Pacific Ocean, according to The Verge. The 8,000-mile cable will run from Los Angeles to Hong Kong with a bandwidth of 120 terabits per second--making it the most powerful internet connection between the U.S. and Asia. Currently, the fastest transpacific internet cable is the Faster, which delivers 60 terabits per second and is also partially owned by Google. Google and Facebook might compete for internet eyeballs, but it's not uncommon for tech giants to team up on this kind of venture. The massive amounts of traffic they serve and data they send means it makes financial sense to own the cables they run on instead of buying bandwidth from someone else. The new cable will help provide faster Internet speeds to internet visitors throughout Asia. Facebook and Microsoft recently teamed up on the Marea, which will connect Northern Virginia and Spain and will be the fastest transatlantic cable when it's completed in 2017. Google already owns part of six other underwater cables, including three that span the Pacific and two that service South America via the Atlantic. Facebook and Google both have other ventures to try to spread fast internet throughout the world. Facebook is in the process of launching satellites that can beam Internet down to rural areas. High speed Google Fiber, meanwhile, is already operating in several U.S. cities. The company is also developing Project Loon, which, if successful, will beam the internet to remote areas via balloon. The new Facebook-Google cable will be called the Pacific Light Cable Network. Some estimates put the total cost for the project at $400 million. It's expected to be completed and functioning by 2018.

By: Adam Kveton For Metro Published on Rather than struggle to keep students away from their phones, teachers at Ottawa’s Catholic school board will soon be asking them to strap their phones to their face instead. That’s the way the board hopes to begin using virtual reality in the classroom. Though high-end virtual reality goggles are now selling for between $400 and $1,200, the Catholic school board’s co-ordinator for learning technologies, Robert Long, is hoping to get students in at a much lower price-point: about $20. He plans to use Google Cardboard – a cardboard box with lenses inside that lets you slide in your phone as a screen and strap the whole thing to your head. With nearly 100 per cent of students carrying smartphones by Grade 7, using Google Cardboard is a relatively cheap and simple way to access a range of content, said Long. But that’s just the ‘how.’ The ‘why’ is to provide students with a much more immersive learning experience than you get looking at pictures in a textbook or video on a regular screen. That, in turn, will hopefully make for more engaged students, said Long. Teachers and others will learn how to use Google applications like Street View to take students on virtual fieldtrips of places all over the world at the EdInnovation Summit in Ottawa from Oct. 22-23. Long plans for the conference to be a major launch point for the use of virtual reality in OCSB classrooms this year. Though he admitted he doesn’t know for certain if virtual reality will catch on, he said the board has already recently re-written its Grade 9 applied level geography course to be based on Google resources, including virtual reality applications. “I think there is teeth in this,” said Long. Ottawa’s three other school boards reported varying uses of virtual reality in some classrooms and schools.

In our previous installment about cloud services, A Side-by-Side Comparison of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure, we did an overview of what is it that you can do in the cloud, covering topics such as computing, analytics and networking. In this article, we’ll dig deeper into cloud storage, starting from small and very practical requirements for domestic users (desktop services), and scaling up to the needs of businesses, using the same technologies. What Is “the Cloud”? The “old” way More from this author Data Serialization Comparison: JSON, YAML, BSON, MessagePack DevOps by Example: Tools, Pros and Cons of a DevOps Culture Not more than just a decade ago, when you needed to upload something to the internet, you would hire a hosting company to rent a certain amount of online space. If you were fancy, you would make an additional backup of files, just in case something happened to that server. And of course, things did happen to servers: hardware failures (it even seemed that hard disk drives (HDD) were just meant to break), crackers (if you ever had an account on a shared hosting, you just knew that every couple of months some foreign flag would appear on your site), and the always unintentional but clumsy overwriting or deletion of files (come on, we all did it). Now, if you were really fancy, you would deploy your files to different locations at once to ensure redundancy and availability, and to minimize the latency worldwide (that is, the amount of time between you request a file, and when you finally access it). However, doing things the right way was not only costly and time consuming, but it required a fair amount of technical savvy (and we didn’t even get to discuss doing load balancing so that your files would still be available during high traffic situations). The new way Today, when you upload a file to a service such as Google Drive, iCloud, Amazon S3 or a hosting grid, this file is automatically replicated in multiple servers and, very often, to multiple locations — so that when you try to access your documents while in Japan or the East Coast of the United States, your request is automatically routed to the closest pool of data that’s available. That is the cloud. Under this new architecture, if a server or a data center gets disrupted, chances are you won’t ever find out, because the traffic is going to be transparently redirected to the next available pool of data. And even if a server gets cracked, the attackers are not going to come across regular files as in a traditional hosting service, because in many cases the data is obscured in some way and even encrypted, and it’s your request that actually builds the file. Mind you, this technology — which is pretty much ubiquitous today — made its breakthrough just a decade ago: Amazon S3, launched in 2006 Dropbox, founded in 2007 iCloud, launched in 2011 Google Drive, launched in 2012 … et cetera. You are already using it Some people (OK, my ex-girlfriend) are hesitant about using the cloud. “The cloud?” they say. “No thanks!” They don’t like this idea of having their files “everywhere”, and it does sound awkward when you put it that way. But as we mentioned, it’s not quite “your files” that are everywhere, but rather the bits of data that can build your files upon your requests. And if you use services such as Gmail or Yahoo Mail (which is another way of saying “if you’re using the internet”), you are already using the cloud, and you realize how convenient that is. To explain further: some of you won’t even remember the days when email was downloaded with a client program to a single machine and everything was lost if something happened to that computer, should there be no backup of those files somewhere else. Gmail or Yahoo Mail are just the cloud version of email — a ubiquitous, secure and reliable service that’s replicated around the world for instant access … Yes, the cloud! Desktop Services There are tons of services, but for this survey, we’ll be listing some that have been running for a couple of years and that offer full-featured free plans, not just limited trial periods. Some of these services have specific tools, or come integrated with services for certain kinds of storage, such as music files, pictures and documents, which we will cover in detail later in the article. (The w is a link the Wikipedia entry.) service docs pics music free plans Amazon Drive w no yes yes 5GB unlimited/$59.99/yr Apple iCloud w no yes yes 5GB 50GB/$0.99/mo; 1TB/$9.99/mo; and more iDrive w no limited no 5GB 1TB/$52.12/yr Google Drive w yes yes yes 15GB 100GB/$1.99/mo; 1TB/$9.99/mo; and more Dropbox w yes limited no 2GB 1TB/$9.99/mo OneDrive w yes limited yes 5GB 50GB/$1.99/mo; 1TB/$6.99/mo Pay attention to how you count space! All of the space you’re using on the same provider will count as a single resource. For example, if you’re using 5GB on Gmail and 2GB on files stored on Google Drive, that means you’re using a total of 7GB, so your available space in case you’re using the free tier would be: 15GB (total space) 
    - 5GB (from Gmail) 
    - 2GB (from Google Drive) 
        = 8GB available
 iCloud is more of a backup service for the iPhone and the Mac rather than a full-featured cloud service, and as such is not available for non-Apple products. In fact, Apple has earned a poor reputation when in comes to interoperability and, while it’s convenient in Apple environments, you’ll come across a number of problems if you ever need to change to Android or temporarily switch to a PC. On the other hand OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is not exclusively a Windows tool, even though it’s developed by Microsoft. You can freely use it on a Mac, your iPhone, and on Linux environments such as Android phones. Documents The field for productivity is certainly that of office documents. You can store these files in any storage service. After all, they’re just files. However, we’re listing here services that, besides storage, also give you the possibility to manage documents right there, allowing users to create, edit, and share documents. Google Drive is the home for Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and Forms. All of them are mature tools that you can use without limitations and for free through your browser. And Google has really managed to make collaborative editing in real-time a true highlight of its office suite. Late but determined, Microsoft joined the online club of productivity tools. You can store your Office documents in OneDrive and have a limited editing and free visualization via Office Online, the free version of Office 365. The licensing scheme for the full-featured products is way to complex to reproduce here, but have a look at it if what you need is full support for Microsoft Office products. Paper is the all-in-one work solution by Dropbox. It’s a fairly limited tool, specially when compared against Google’s tools or the full-fledged Office 365. But its simplicity might also be its main advantage, given that it’s a very straightforward tool to use that requires little training. And it does support collaboration, rich formatting and, of course, Dropbox attachments. There are some workarounds and plans to integrate iCloud with iWork, Apple’s office suite, which would bring document editing capabilities to the iCloud service. For now, though, we count it as a missing feature. Pictures If there is a backup service you should start using now, this is it. It’s sad to know that still today many families keep their treasured memories on a desktop or laptop computer hard drive. If I wasn’t clear before, I’ll try to make it clear now: the hard drive of a computer (especially the traditional HDD) is a bomb about to explode. And even if you have a more reliable solid-state drive (SSD), still, your laptop could get stolen, get a virus, or disappear into the blue (why not?). When it comes to storing and sharing pictures, for some of you Facebook may do just fine, but it does fall short on features: you can’t order prints, you can’t search by date, or edit. And what if you decided one day to get rid of Facebook altogether? As a solution, all of the services we’ll cover here will automatically upload for you every new pic or video that you take on your phone or that you sync from your camera to your computer, thus enabling you to clean up space very quickly and allowing you to select later what you keep or not. service free space plans Amazon Prime Photos w 5GB unlimited/$59.99/yr Flickr w 1TB 2TB/$5.99/mo Google Photos w unlimited 100GB/$1.99/mo; 1TB/$9.99/mo; and more iCloud Photo Library w 5GB 50GB/$0.99/mo; 1TB/$9.99/mo; and more Dropbox used to bundle a decent photo service called Carousel that they unfortunately decided to shut down in early 2016. They still have support for automatically uploading of photos from your phone and visualizing them with an app or the browser, but features come nowhere close to those of these other services. Microsoft also hasn’t integrated OneDrive with a dedicated photo service so far. Flickr is arguably the place for sharing photos, with the biggest community of pros and amateur photo enthusiasts, a website that’s been running and adding features since 2004, and great organization tools and privacy settings. iCloud comes with a tool called iCloud Photo Library, and Google Drive comes integrated with Google Photos (formerly Picasa Web Albums). Both are full-featured photo services for tagging people, sharing and creating albums, and even editing pictures, along with many more features. A huge plus is that Google Photos gives you unlimited storage for pictures for free (that is, without subtracting space from your Google Drive account) as long as you don’t need to store the originals for pictures in resolutions higher than 16 megapixels. Should you choose this option, it will shrink your hi-res pics to 2048×2048 (in other words, OK for most domestic uses). A fairly limited product with few organizational tools and no search, Amazon Prime Photos (paid) is the most generous when it comes to storage — unlimited for all images, including hi-res. Music You can also use the cloud for storing your ripped CDs and MP3 files. You’ll have the benefit of being able to stream your music from everywhere for free with your phone or computer, and forget altogether about the idea of bringing your files on USB drives and other media whenever you want to take your music somewhere else. Aside from streaming, all of these services allow you with certain limitations to upload your own music collection: service free upload w/subscription plans Amazon Music w 250 250,000 $25/yr (storing only) Groove Music w up to 5 GB unlimited $7/mo (streaming and storing) Google Play Music w 50,000 50,000 $9.99/mo (streaming and storing) iTunes Match w no 100,000 $25/yr (storing only) Some of these services also include family packages so that different users can simultaneously access the service for a reduced fee. This is the case with the Google Play Music family plan, allowing unlimited access up to six family members for $14.99/mo. Notice that, when you pay a streaming subscription, you also have access to millions of songs in high definition audio. But as we covered here, this is not a requirement for uploading your own music files to the cloud. And talking about music subscription services, we won’t discuss services such as Apple Music , Spotify, Deezer or Tidal, as these are intended strictly for streaming (that is, you pay a fee to stream music on demand) with no option for uploading and storing your own music library. Google allows for uploading local music to the cloud with the Music Manager tool. The subscription to Google Play Music also includes YouTube Red, which is the ad-free version of YouTube, along with access to YouTube Red Original series and films. Amazon Music also allows uploading music, but through an app. Although Amazon shut down its Music Importer tool, they didn’t entirely get rid of the option to upload music, which can be done now with the Amazon Music app. iTunes Match will automatically try to match your local collection to what’s available on iTunes, and it will automatically add to your online library whatever matches without you needing to upload any actual files. However, you need to pay a subscription to be able to use this feature. Uploading files to Groove Music is a bit more of a hassle, and you need to keep space in mind. First, there’s no way to match your collection as with iTunes, so you’ll need to upload files individually or sync your Music folder to OneDrive. Second, and unlike the previously mentioned services, here you’ll be using up space from your cloud storage account, in this case OneDrive. However, if you’re already paying for a OneDrive subscription, this may be OK with you; same if you’re paying the $7/mo subscription for Groove Music. Storage for Business There are very interesting options for those who like the simplicity and practicality of the desktop services we described, and would like to take just that to the working environment. These services may be very attractive for companies, because some of the functionalities we already described plus some of these extras: easy online collaboration (which is a huge plus for the enterprise) no APIs to integrate; in general, no additional training for users (for example, if you already use Google Docs, you’re good to go) control panels for administrators (to manage users’ access, space quotas, and other features). service space plans, per user Box 100GB (starter); unlimited (business) €4/mo (starter); €12/mo (business) iDrive Business 250GB (A); 1.25TB (C) $74.62/yr (A); $374.62/yr (C) [unlimited users] Dropbox Business unlimited $15/mo Google Drive for Work 1TB (for less than 5 users) $10/mo OneDrive for Business 1TB (plan 1); 5TB (plan 2) $5/mo (plan 1); $10/mo (plan 2) Be careful when evaluating the total cost of these services, as you’ll need to take into account both your storage requirements and the amount of employees. Cloud Storage for Websites, Apps and Archiving There are, of course, services oriented towards storing objects for websites and applications, as well as online archiving, and even building a content delivery network (CDN). For details about these services, you should see the “Storage” section of “A Side-by-Side Comparison of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure“. Conclusions We’ve seen plenty of options for using the cloud to store your digital assets, including free and very rich-featured ones. If you’re a domestic user who wants to keep it simple, you might be better off choosing a desktop service and sticking to it for all of your needs. In addition, or as an alternative, you might pick a specific service for a specific type of storage (say, Flickr for pictures). And in some cases, you’ll be able to smoothly transfer these practices and tools to your company. In any case, don’t risk losing files and information you value, and keep your music, pictures and documents in a safe, accessible place. The cloud is your friend.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. Does Link Building Still Matter? More from this author SEO Bootcamp for Beginners How to Run an SEO Test in 5 Steps 7 Steps to Write Content that Converts As part of the original ranking algorithm, backlinks have always been an important ranking signal for Google. Using links to determine trust and authority was one of their biggest assets that allowed them to overtake competing search engines. However, since the Penguin update back in 2012, people have been predicting the end of link building as SEO. Some reasons for this are: Devaluing link spam made benefiting from link building more difficult. Punishing sites for participating in link schemes made link building much more risky if you got it wrong. There was some ambiguity surrounding what exactly would run afoul of Penguin, which scared many people away from link building entirely. SEOs jumping on the content marketing wagon. These factors combined to push people away from the idea of manual link building and toward “link earning” through content marketing — the idea that quality content is link bait that will just naturally attract links. This was based on the belief that highly-shared content would bring in lots of links. The problem? That isn’t really the case — there is almost no correlation between shares and links. In fact, the majority of content doesn’t receive any shares or links at all. So what does this mean? Creating good content is necessary to building links, but it isn’t enough. Links don’t happen on their own. They require strategic, manual promotion to the right audience. And since links are still an integral part of Google’s ranking algorithm, failure to do link building will limit your SEO and therefore your reach. If you’re still doubting the importance of link building, the fact that Google has incorporated Penguin into its core algorithm is proof of their importance for rankings. How to Build Links Step 1: Create Some Content The number one most important part of building links is to first create content worth sharing. Easier said than done, of course. So how can you create a content strategy geared toward backlinks? It’s actually pretty simple: leverage the content that already gets links. People link to content they find useful, accurate and unique. To figure out what sort of content meets that criteria, look at what your audience is already sharing. There are tools out there like Ahrefs and Buzzsumo that let you search by topic so you can find articles in your niche that people found useful enough to link to. Pages with a lot of shares and links show that there’s already considerable demand for that content, which makes securing links much easier. Use Majestic to identify some of your own content that’s managed to attract valuable links. You don’t necessarily want to repurpose this content because you’ll cannibalize your own links, but it will give you some good ideas for content your audience likes. If you’re feeling a bit sneaky, you can engage in some corporate espionage to find your competitors’ highly shared content to use so you can usurp some of their links. Once you’ve got some good pieces of content, make it your own by making it better. Some good ways to rewrite and upgrade content are: Update it: There’s a good chance there’s some older, less relevant content out there getting linked to, particularly if you’re in a fast-paced industry. Update it by adding new, relevant information and links to make it more useful. A good example of this type of thing is 302 redirects: Until recently it was SEO best practice to avoid 302 redirects as it was thought they didn’t pass full PageRank. That changed this year, so there are still lots of articles about SEO best practices out there telling people to avoid 302 redirect. This your opportunity to earn a link by correcting this out of date content. Expand it: Some of the most shared content are lists like “top 10 kale recipes” or “5 ways to organize your home.” Improve on these lists and adding to the number of entries. If you can, aim to double or even triple them. Some of these longer lists don’t go into much detail or don’t include any references. If that’s the case, add some detail and links, even if it’s just a sentence or two for each point. This makes content way more valuable. Redesign it: Design is a big part of user experience — people won’t link to sites that don’t look good or are hard to read. Add some aesthetically-pleasing visual elements to help readers get more out of it. Or, if it makes sense, turn it into an infographic. Infographics are some of the most popular forms of content on the web in terms of sharing and linking. You can make it even easier to share by creating embed code that links back to your site. Blogs are one of the best, and most popular, ways to add published content to your website, but it’s not always the right choice for everyone. Having a blog just for SEO won’t really help you much if you don’t have the resources to maintain it and consistently publish new content. If that’s the case, concentrate on creating longer pieces of evergreen content that will stay relevant for months or even years. Evergreen content is a good idea even if you don’t have a blog, and will help you protect your links from people doing what we just described. Step 2. Build a List and a Spreadsheet This is a relatively simple step, but it can make or break your link building. Successful campaigns require sticking with a well thought out strategy and tracking your progress. The next step in your link building strategy is to cultivate a list of potential links. If you haven’t done some competitor link research yet, do so now. You’ll end up with a list of pages that are interested in your niche, cover topics relevant to your website and show the propensity to link to content similar (but not nearly as good) to your own. Then, put together a list of other websites to reach out to in order to build links. Here are a couple of tools to use for this: AuthorCrawl: AuthorCrawl uses the Moz API to find links to a URL and then crawls those pages looking for authorship markup. It then collects information from the author’s linked Google+ page so you can determine their influence and position in the industry. You’ll also get the author’s URL and Page and Domain Authority information. BlogDash: BlogDash is a blogger outreach platform. It has a searchable database of bloggers that you can filter by category to include only those who write about topics relevant to your business and by Google rank to maximize your reach. You’ll also see recent topics they’ve covered and, most importantly, their contact information. Once you’ve got your list of names and information, get organized. Dump your list of bloggers into a spreadsheet with columns for subject, domain, reach, authority, recent posts and a few columns to note outreach efforts like date and methods of contact and response. You might be tempted to sort this list solely by Domain Authority or reach, but resist the impulse. It’s more efficient and you’ll see better results if you focus your efforts on writers who are more relevant to your business. Step 3: Manual Outreach As we said before, link building outreach is a manual process. You can automate it if you really want to, but people can sniff out form letters a mile away and you’ll just fill up spam folders. For best results, write your emails yourself, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use a general outline for format. Use the following elements in your email templates to help streamline your process: Your added value: Writers probably won’t be interested in linking to something they’ve previously covered, especially if it doesn’t add anything for their readers. Start off your email by telling them how your article or website will fill in a gap in their previous post. A great way to add value here is to offer a solution to broken links. Use the Check My Links extension to find invalid links that could be redirected to your site. Hyperlink anchor text: Don’t copy and paste URLs directly into your email — it looks like you automated your outreach by pulling information out of a database. Instead, hyperlink using anchor text. It will give your emails a more polished look and if you use generic anchor text (like “here”), they’ll look less spammy. If you’re referencing an article they’ve written recently, don’t worry too much about linking back to that article — writers generally remember their recent work. Unique subject line: You’re likely competing with dozens, or even hundreds for the really popular writers, of people for their attention. Use the subject line as a lure, making it specific enough that the recipient will figure out what topic you’re contacting them on, but vague enough they won’t be able to tell you’re hitting them up for a link. If your email subject reads like you’re doing mass email outreach it will get deleted unopened. Your contact info: Add your personal contact information including email, website, social media and even a phone number. Spammers don’t give out their details so this will add to your credibility. Include a personal touch whenever you can. Bland, generic emails will leave a bad taste in your recipient’s mouth, which could damage your relationship and impact your efforts going forward. In the beginning you’ll probably only get a response from a small percentage of your list, but that’s ok. Outreach is as much about building the relationship as it is about getting a specific link. Plus, you reached out to these bloggers because they have a big audience and/or a lot of link juice to pass, so just a few links can have big returns. Step 4: Link Reclamation Link reclamation is a slightly different form of link building, but still requires manual link building. It’s the process of finding and fixing broken links pointing at your website. These links can happen for a wide variety of reasons: You moved a page on your site or the owner of the linking site has a typo in the link’s href URL. Use Google Search Console’s Crawl Error report to find and export a list of your URLs that return 404 errors. Go back to your backlinks tool like Majestic or Ahrefs, and export your list of backlinks. Copy your list of URLs returning 404 into this spreadsheet. Use VLOOKUP to map your backlink URLs to status code. Just sort or filter your list by status to see your broken backlinks. Alternatively, once you have your list of backlinks, crawl them with Screaming Frog using list mode and filter the results by Client Error (4XX). Compiling your list of dead backlinks is the hard part. The next stage, outreach, is ideally as easy as emailing the linking site’s owner with an updated URL. Point out that fixing dead links is in their best interest as well because it improves user experience and SEO. You should record a high conversion rate for these emails. Conclusion Since the beginning, link building has gone hand in hand with SEO — you can’t do one without the other. Links tell search engines that people think your site is relevant and valuable enough to endorse to their audience, and their importance to ranking in SERPs isn’t going away anytime soon. That means manual link building campaigns are still important for your digital marketing. The good news is that if you produce good content and approach link building in a strategic, organized way, your efforts will pay off with more links and higher search rankings.

First, Google Photos will now help users “rediscover old memories” of the people in their most recent photos. Specifically, the platform will automatically create galleries of older photos, containing the same people in a user’s most recent photos. Second, Google Photos will now automatically create galleries containing highlights from a user’s photos. In a blog post, Tim Novikoff, product manager of Google Photos, explained: If you take a lot of photos of your child, for example, you may occasionally get a card showing the best ones from the last month. (Hint hint: grandparents would love to see these!) Next, Google Photos will now automatically create animations from a user’s videos, which they can share with friends. Novikoff explained: We look for segments that capture activity—a jump into the pool, or even just an adorable smile—and create short animations that are easy to share. Finally, when Google Photos detects sideways pictures in a user’s library, it will now present these pictures to the user in a card that will allow them to quickly rotate them all at once. As these new galleries and animations are created, users can access them in the platform’s Assistant tab. Google Photos is available to download for free on the iTunes App Store and Google Play.

It’s a VR camera app for Android devices and it offers more than what traditional VR apps provide. According to Google, they combined two things they love—virtual reality (VR) and taking pictures—and calls the app “perfectly imperfect.” “Sprayscape is a quick hack using the phone’s gyroscope to take pictures on the inside of a 360-degree sphere,” writes Glenn Cochon, Google’s senior designer, in a blog post. “Just point your phone and tap the screen to spray faces, places, or anything else onto your canvas.” Once the user has captured footage via the app, created in Unity with native Android support, they can save their “scape.” Saving the creation stores a flat panorama image in the app data, according to Google. They can also share their creations through a link. Those with access to the link can experience the user-created landscape and look through using their device or Google Cardboard—the company’s budget-friendly fold-out cardboard VR headset and first virtual reality product. Experiencing a scape takes the flat image and “wraps it to a sphere” so that it is “navigable on mobile web” when the viewer pans, tils and moves it on their device. “Sprayscape maps the camera feed on a 360 degree sphere, using the Cardboard SDK to handle gyroscope data and the NatCam Unity plugin for precise camera control,” says Google. Earlier this month, Google unveiled a new VR headset, called the “ Daydream View ,” and a wand controller. The headset-and-controller combo requires a smartphone to work and synchronizes wirelessly. It promises users a better optic experience. “With Daydream, you simply pop a Daydream-ready phone in the headset to start exploring,” writes Clay Bavor, head of Google’s VR team, in a blog post . “Powered by Android 7.0 Nougat, Daydream-ready phones are built with high-resolution displays, powerful mobile processors and high-fidelity sensors—all tuned to support great VR experiences. Google’s newest Pixel and Pixel XL are the first Daydream-ready phones, and there are a lot more on the way from leading Android smartphone makers.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

If you travel to the Google.com homepage on desktop and mobile, you may see a pop up asking whether you’d like to pre-order the new Google Pixel phones. Tapping 'Yes Please' will take you directly to the product on the Made by Google site (via AndroidPolice). Unfortunately, due to stock levels, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to get one right now anyway, but at least Google is getting your eyeballs where it wants them. Related: Best Google Pixel cases Putting links to the product on the homepage appears to be a pretty smart ploy, which it has used before for previous Nexus phones and tablets. Numerous times Google has been accused by competition regulators of using its dominant position in search to push its own products. This, of course, is slightly different. Google isn’t looking to rig search results. It’s putting the product front and centre on the world’s most visited webpage.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ f t ✉ ⎕ 60 Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Images Dear Clinton Team: We Noticed You Might Need Some Email Security Tips Micah Lee Micah Lee 2016-10-13T18:34:48+00:00 Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Images There is probably no one more acutely aware of the importance of good cybersecurity right now than Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, whose emails have been laid bare by WikiLeaks, are being mined for news by journalists (including at The Intercept), and are available for anyone with internet access to read. So as a public service to Podesta and everyone else on Clinton’s staff, here are some email security tips that could have saved you from getting hacked, and might help you in the future. Use a strong password There’s a method for coming up with passwords that are mathematically unfeasible for anyone to ever guess by brute force, but that are still possible for you to memorize. I’ve written about it before, in detail, including an explanation of the math behind it. But in short: You start with a long list of words and then randomly select one (by rolling dice), then another, and so on, until you end up with something like: “slinging gusty bunny chill gift.” Using this method, called Diceware, there is a one in 28 quintillion (that is, 28 with 18 zeros at the end) chance of guessing this exact password. For online services that prevent attackers from making very many guesses — including Gmail — a five-word Diceware password is much stronger than you’ll ever need. To make it super easy, use this wordlist from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Do not use a weak password So if that’s a strong password, what does a weak password look like? “Runner4567.” How did the 3l33t h4x0r5 figure out Podesta's super secure password?https://t.co/QSEntXWhGj pic.twitter.com/qMsM9UEXge — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 12, 2016 Use a unique password for each application The same day that WikiLeaks published Podesta’s email, his Twitter account got hacked as well. How do you think that happened? I have a guess: He reused a password that was exposed in his email, and someone tried it on his Twitter account. Even if you use a strong password, it quickly becomes worthless if you use it everywhere. The average person has accounts on dozens of websites. For those who reuse passwords, all it takes is for any one of those sites to get hacked and your password to get compromised, and the hacker can gain access to your accounts on all of them. You can avoid this by using different strong passwords for every account. The only way this is possible is by using a password manager, a program that remembers all your passwords for you (in an encrypted database) so you don’t have to. You should secure your password manager with an especially strong password. I recommend a seven-word Diceware passphrase. There are many password managers to choose from: KeePassX, LastPass, 1Password, and more. Shop around for whichever one fits your organization the best. It doesn’t so much matter which you use, so long as you use strong, unique passwords for each account. Password managers also help you generate secure random passwords. Turn on two-factor authentication Last year, when I asked National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden what ordinary people could do to improve their computer security, one of the first pieces of advice he gave was to use two-factor authentication. If Podesta had enabled it on his Gmail account, you probably wouldn’t be reading his email today. Google calls it “2-Step Verification” and has an excellent website explaining why you need it, how it works, and how it protects you. In short: When you log in to your account, after you type in your password you’ll need one more piece of information before Google will allow you to proceed. Depending on how you set it up you might receive this uniquely generated information in a text message, a voice call, or a mobile app, or you could plug in a special security key into your USB port. Once you start using it, hackers who manage to trick you into giving up your password still won’t be able to log in to your account — at least not without successfully executing a separate attack against your phone or physically stealing your security key. Do it right this second Google handles all of the email for hillaryclinton.com. If you’re a Clinton staffer, you should immediately stop what you’re doing and make sure you’ve enabled 2-Step Verification for your email. You should also enable two-factor authentication for all of the many other services that support it, including Twitter, Facebook, Slack, and Dropbox, to name just a few. (If Podesta had enabled it on his Twitter account, that probably wouldn’t have gotten hacked either.) Watch out for phishers How did these prominent political figures get their emails hacked in the first place? It appears that Russian hackers used “spear-phishing” attacks against many high-profile political targets, and some of them bit. Spear-phishing works like this: The attacker sends a target a carefully crafted email, something that looks legitimate but is actually a fake. The target clicks a link in the email and ends up at what looks like a login page for their bank, or an online store, or, in this case, the Google login page. But it’s not. If they carefully examined the URL of the website, they would see that it doesn’t begin with https://accounts.google.com/ and therefore isn’t a real Google login page. But they don’t notice, so they go ahead and enter their username and password. Without realizing it, they just gave their Google password to the attacker. Now the attacker can use this password to log in to the target’s Gmail account and download all of their email (assuming they are not using two-factor authentication, that is). Well-crafted spear-phishing emails can be incredibly hard to spot, but if you ever end up on a website asking you for a password, you should be skeptical. Check the URL and make sure you’re at a legitimate login page before typing in your password, or navigate to the login page directly. Encrypt your email All of the previous tips are aimed at keeping your email account secure. But even if you follow all of the security best practices, it’s still possible that your email could get compromised. For example: You could fall for an incredibly sophisticated spear-phishing attack that tricks you into giving up your password as well as your two-factor authentication token Your Google Apps administrator could get hacked, giving the hacker the ability to reset the email passwords of everyone in your organization A hacker could find a fundamental security flaw in Gmail itself and use that to gain access to your account A state-level actor could find a way to exploit the infrastructure of the internet to spy on all of your data held by Google Or maybe you just don’t trust Google, or anyone who can compel the company with legal requests for data, with the contents of your email. For any or all of those reasons, it’s probably worth using encrypted email. Using encrypted email is more complicated than using a strong password and using two-factor authentication — which are really easy — but it’s simple enough that everyone at The Intercept, including all of the non-nerds, uses it. An important caveat is that everyone needs to be ready to use encrypted email before you can start using; you can’t send an encrypted email to someone who doesn’t have an encryption key yet. (You can find our encryption keys on our staff profiles if you want to send us encrypted emails.) To get started, check out the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Surveillance Self-Defense guide for using email encryption for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. If enough people in your organization use encrypted email, consider using our newly released tool GPG Sync to make it somewhat simpler. Had Podesta, or anyone in the Democratic National Committee — or really anyone who’s had their email leaked in recent years — used encrypted email, a lot more of the emails would look something like this: What an encrypted email looks like from Gmail’s perspective. If a hacker steals all of your encrypted email and then wants to decrypt it, they’ll need to hack into your computer and steal your secret encryption key. That is a whole level of difficulty higher than just getting your password. If you choose to keep your secret encryption key on a physical USB device, such as a Yubikey, the hacker has even more hoops to jump through before they have any hope of decrypting your emails. Alternately, use an encrypted messaging app instead of email If encrypting your email sounds too hard, it might make sense to just use email less, in favor of easy-to-use encrypted message apps such as Signal. The Clinton campaign is reportedly already using Signal for its mobile communications about Donald Trump. Now the iPhone version of the app has desktop support, too. So if you need to send a quick, but sensitive, message to a colleague, why not type it into the Signal app instead of sending an email? Don’t listen to the wrong people Hillary Clinton’s policy on encryption is dubious, even to the point of calling for the government to commission a “Manhattan-like project” to figure out how to create strong, unbreakable encryption that nevertheless has a back door for law enforcement to access. This idea is firmly in the realm of fantasy, because a back door is definitionally a weakness. And no matter what U.S. policy is in the future, the email encryption I described above will not contain a backdoor and will be available to everyone in the world, because it’s open source software developed largely outside of the United States. The obvious conclusion is that Clinton simply doesn’t understand cybersecurity, in theory or in practice. On the practical level, she needs better in-house technical expertise. On the theoretical level, she should listen to the unanimous consensus of cryptography experts and take a firm stance in support of strong encryption without back doors. This will improve the cybersecurity of both government and private businesses, protect the constitutionally protected privacy rights of Americans — and maybe even save herself from similar embarrassments in the future.

Photo by Paul Kuroda By Mark Hedin | mhedin@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: October 13, 2016 at 12:15 pm | UPDATED: October 28, 2016 at 5:55 pm OAKLAND — Google unveiled its first Code Next site in East Oakland’s Fruitvale Village, where teens can learn tech in a program developed with MIT. It is Google’s first such venture, though another is planned to open next year in Harlem, N.Y. “We call it a playground, a place for kids to stretch their minds,” said Nilka Thomas, Google’s director of diversity and inclusion. “A lot of folks have been asking, ‘Why Oakland?’ We want to make sure that the next generation of tech leaders come from Oakland — and are black and Latino,” she said. “This is my proudest moment after 12 years at Google,” Thomas added. “They’re going to do things to this industry that we cannot imagine or believe. Their contributions are going to change the world.” Her optimism set the tone for the evening last week, as a couple of hundred people celebrated Code Next’s arrival. The center has been operating since January on a pilot basis, but the build-out was only completed and ready for public viewing after a summer break. By setting neighborhood youngsters on the path to becoming tech innovators, the goal is to diversify the upper echelons of the tech industry and harness the creativity and genius of African-Americans and Latinos, underrepresented in the world of technology. “We are the perfect match for Google, are we not?” Mayor Libby Schaaf asked the gathering of about 200 on the roof of Fruitvale Village on Oct. 6. “We are innovative, and we can even be a little disruptive at times,” she said to chuckles. “It’s the meeting of Google’s tech resources and the genius of Oakland youth. You can create whatever you have in your mind,” the mayor said. Google connected with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop a curriculum for Code Next to inspire kids who may not have naturally gravitated to the field and foster independent, creative thinking once they set their foot in the door. Google research found that 51 percent of black students and 47 percent of Latino students nationwide don’t have access to computer science classes in school, Thomas said. “Without this access, students will be unable to discover an interest in computer science or be inspired by the possibilities that come along with it,” she said. “Code Next fills this gap with a curriculum to get students started and provides opportunities that may otherwise have been out of reach,” Thomas said. Google expects to eventually make the Code Next methodology available to all interested educators as open source material. The program and Fruitvale Village site are entirely funded by Google and offered at no charge. The teenagers are referred by their schools or community organizations such as Black Girls Code, Hack the Hood, Level Playing Field or Unity Council. They have the freedom to pursue projects of their own impulses. Instead of the usual model of lecturing, Code Next sees its approach to working with youngsters as being more of a facilitator. “Teaching ‘at’ students is replaced by teaching them to understand how to become more effective problem solvers,”  said Topper Carew, of MIT’s media lab, who worked with Google in developing the curriculum of “coding, computational thinking, engineering and design principles, in a safe place where one is encouraged to learn from mistakes.” “As long as we continue to fuel the imagination, the potential is immense,” said Errol King, of Google. The space, about 1,500 square feet on the first floor of Fruitvale Village, is divided into a classroom and a lab with 3-D printers, laser cutters and other tech equipment. Architect Danish Kurani showed off the brightly colored space, decorated with images of tech innovators of every ethnicity. “Especially in this neighborhood, how do we inspire these students to want to be the next generation of inventors, computer scientists, innovators, engineers and disrupters?” he said. “They don’t have role models now. We want to make these guys rock stars,” Kurani said of the students. Among the innovators featured on the walls are such non-household names as Marcos Mejia, Anaid Chacon, Uche Nnadi, David Sengeh and Fadel Adid. “Code Next has given us a sense of direction for our young engineer,” said Lisa Cruz, whose son, Elias, participated in this year’s pilot program and spoke of how he sees his dad, also, as an engineer, but one who “did not have the opportunities that I do.” “As we’ve seen our young man blossom, we knew this would be a pathway we would explore,” Lisa Cruz said. “I believe this is what Oakland students need more of.” “We expect to see some of these students in our buildings after graduation,” Carew said.

The service aims to address a longstanding problem. The world’s library catalogs contain a wealth of detailed, vetted, and authoritative data about books, movies, music, art—all types of content. But the bulk of library data is stored in MARC records. The bots that major search engines use to scan and index the web generally cannot access those records, and aren’t designed to work with MARC formatting, which was originally developed for 1960s and 1970s-era computers. “Catalogs are generally contained in an ILS [integrated library system], and they aren’t visible on the open web,” explained Vailey Oehlke, director of libraries for Multnomah County, OR, which has been working with Zepheira for more than a year. “That’s exactly what Zepheira’s linked data solution hopes to change.” Zepheira has been the Library of Congress’s key partner in the development of the BIBFRAME structured data model for bibliographic description, which LC hopes will eventually supplant MARC. The company was also founding sponsor of the Libhub Initiative, which analyzed how linked data might be used to raise the visibility of libraries on the web and worked to establish consensus within the field regarding best practices, laying the groundwork for Library.Link. Companies and services currently involved with the new initiative include SirsiDynix, Innovative Interfaces, EBSCO Information Services, NoveList, LibraryAware, Counting Opinions, and Atlas Systems. Zepheira copies a partner library’s catalog, converts records into the structured BIBFRAME format, and then hosts these BIBFRAME records in the Library.Link global, shared content distribution network designed for large-scale web ingest. The library’s original catalog remains intact—as Zepheira’s VP of Product Management Jeff Penka explained, the process is “non-destructive to current data and systems.” And content updating—currently every couple of weeks—ensures that data hosted by Zepheira is current, reflecting titles that have been recently acquired or weeded by the library, for example. Creative Commons licensing—requiring attribution to the library—is also added to each record, ensuring that service providers such as Google and Microsoft know where the data came from and what companies are allowed to do with it. Collections are one of the library’s largest assets, but also one of the most invisible on the web, Penka said. A library website might contain a few hundred discretely indexable pages, “but imagine if every individual page in the library catalog was able to be indexed. Now you’re talking about hundreds of thousands, or millions more.” Separately, libraries add key descriptive information to their “Local Link Graph” domain on the Library.Link network, such as branch locations and operating hours, library services, links, upcoming events, staff listings, and more. Zepheira structures this data for ingest by search engine web crawlers as well, using schema.org and Facebook Open Graph structured data markup. In partnership with Zepheira, SirsiDynix in January launched “BLUEcloud Visibility,” and Innovative Interfaces Inc. in March launched “Innovative Linked Data,” both of which integrate these processes with their customers’ existing ILS or LSP (library services platform). “We’ve been talking about this for years—how do we help libraries…put their content online and make it visible?” said Eric Keith, VP of global marketing, communications, and strategic alliances for SirsiDynix. According to some “back of the envelope math,” Keith estimated that only .003 percent of content searches originate on library websites and catalogs, compared to the vast majority that originate on the open web. “We know that a huge percentage of searches do not involve the library, so if we could make that content from libraries show up, it could be a sea change as far as the visibility of libraries,” Keith added. Search evolution This project, and the BIBFRAME initiative more broadly, comes at a time when search engines have been undergoing a sea change of their own. Readers have probably noticed Google’s “Knowledge Graph” cards, which have been popping up alongside search results involving popular topics for a few years. A search for a current artist, such as Beyoncé, will result in a panel with a bio, a summary of recent news, lists of upcoming tour and event dates, images, song and album lists, links to official social media profiles, and more. Users no longer have to scroll through summaries of pages that may or may not have the information for which they were looking. Drawing current information from multiple different websites, these panels are an early example of the power of structured, linked data. Early search engines, such as AltaVista, worked by using web crawlers to build an index of the entire web that users could then search. Retrieving the most relevant pages was somewhat dependent on the user’s ability to narrow results using advanced search options and Boolean operators. Google revolutionized search in the late 1990s with an algorithm that, essentially, used a citation model. The engine still used web crawlers to build an index of websites, but the algorithm ranked site relevance by analyzing which sites had the most links pointing back to them from around the web. The PageRank algorithm has been refined over the past two decades, but for years Google and other Internet search providers have been working on the next major Internet evolution—building a web of data that computers can process, defining entities and identifying relationships, or “links,” between those entities. In their May 2001 Scientific American article “The Semantic Web,” Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler, and Ora Lassila envisioned a future in which, “the Semantic Web will bring structure to the meaningful content of Web pages, creating an environment where software agents roaming from page to page can readily carry out sophisticated tasks for users. Such an agent coming to [a medical clinic’s] Web page will know not just that the page has keywords such as “treatment, medicine, physical, therapy” (as might be encoded today) but also that Dr. Hartman works at this clinic on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and that the script takes a date range in yyyy-mm-dd format and returns appointment times.” Librarians have been hearing about the promise of the semantic web and linked data ever since. But these concepts are no longer theoretical. For a literary example, Google’s Knowledge Graph can use a structured data source such as Wikidata to establish that Jane Austen was a novelist who wrote books including Pride and Prejudice and Emma, and then use another structured data source, such as IMDb, separately to determine that these works have since been adapted many times over as movies and miniseries, including related, modern adaptations such as Clueless. Pulling information from multiple sites, the Knowledge Graph can display a fairly thorough summary of information about Austen, including images, a brief bio, famous quotes, book covers and links to books, as well as links to movies and shows based on those books. The official website of a contemporary artist, performance venue, restaurant, or business, etc. will also be regarded as a trusted source of information by the Knowledge Graph. If webmasters use structured data markup such as schema.org—created and supported by Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Yandex—search engines will be able extract information such as upcoming events, recent releases, or mapped locations, hours of operation, and menus, and display that information in the Knowledge Graph card on a search results page. If Google can determine the location of the user conducting the search via IP address or smartphone geolocation, then these results are tailored and mapped to that location. Of course, the data involving 19th and 21st century superstars like Jane Austen and Beyoncé is relatively easy to retrieve and confirm. So is information from official websites of restaurant chains, major concert and sports venues, and other corporate entities currently using structured data on their websites. New connections By hosting catalog records, and information about library locations and events as structured data, the Library.Link network will present libraries—individually and in aggregate—as a major source of high-quality, vetted linked data that Google and other search engines can use to improve search results and expand features like the Knowledge Graph cards. In turn, as the sources of this high-quality data, participating libraries and library content will surface more prominently in relevant open web searches, based on the location from which people conduct their searches. Penka described how a library’s records of a popular author, such as Neil Gaiman, would work in this scenario, once Library.Link converts a MARC record catalog to BIBFRAME and hosts it on the open web. “In the context of linked data [Gaiman] is a person,” he said. “But if you actually dig in on Neil, he’s also a contributor [to anthologies], a [content] creator, a focus [of interviews, criticism, and interpretation], a conservator, a narrator [of audiobooks]…and this information all came from MARC data. All of this rich information basically means, as we’re teaching the web how to consume this…there is no such page like that in the catalog [showcasing the entirety of his work], but we’ve taught the web how to get to over 250 other items in the catalog.” Partnerships with services such as EBSCO’s LibraryAware and NoveList aim to enhance the richness of that data. The new NoveList Select for Linked Data service, for example, adds metadata such as subject headings, genres, tone, pace, writing style, and appeal terms to BIBFRAME catalog records in the Library.Link network, generating readalikes and other information to help readers explore a library’s collection. “In 2010 we started enriching library catalogs with our content so that readers who were using the library’s most frequently consulted resource could see and find the content that would help guide them to their next book,” said NoveList cofounder and general manager Duncan Smith. “Today, when…a search for information, or a book, or an event, or workshop [usually starts on the open web] we had an opportunity with Zepheira…to make libraries more visible, and communicate their value.” Oehlke said that the early growth of Library.Link may be slow going, with results improving as more libraries add records to the network. But Multnomah was already seeing results when she discussed the project with LJ a few weeks ago. “Since we published the data last year, we’ve seen over 23,000 visits to our catalog” originating as open web searches, and 20 percent of those visits were from mobile devices. “I think [the project] has a ton of wonderful potential,” she said. “I have every expectation that it will pick up as more libraries sign on.” About Matt Enis Matt Enis (menis@mediasourceinc.com; @matthewenis on Twitter) is Associate Editor, Technology for Library Journal.

Last evening saw the release of Chrome 54 for Mac, Windows and Linux which continues on Google’s mission to ditch Flash in favor of HTML5: the new version replaces old Flash-based YouTube embeds on websites with HTML5. As VentureBeat notes, the old Flash-based YouTube embeds still exist all over the web, but Chrome 54 now takes care of that. Chrome 54 also implements 21 security fixes. Chrome 54 for Android and iOS are on their way. Changing how Chrome handles YouTube embeds has strengthened Chrome’s security while de-emphasizing Flash in favor of HTML5 has allowed engineers to improve its responsiveness, efficiency and power consumption for many websites. TUTORIAL: How to remove Adobe Flash from your Mac “HTML5 is much lighter and faster, and publishers are switching over to speed up page loading and save you more battery life,” said the search firm. Chrome 54 also provides support for the custom elements V1 spec which lets web developers create custom HTML tags and define their API/behavior in JavaScript. An improved BroadcastChannel API permits one-to-many messaging between windows, tabs and iframes—useful for complex web apps that use multiple windows/tabs. Released in September 2016, Chrome 53 blocked Flash by default. In addition to delivering web video, more than 90 percent of Flash on the web loads behind the scenes to support things like page analytics, which slows your computer down. TUTORIAL: How to enable Chrome’s MacBook battery-saving feature If you already have Chrome installed on your Mac, its silent updating mechanism should ensure that you’re always running the latest version available. You can check for Chrome updates manually at any time by choosing About Google Chrome in the Chrome menu. Chrome 54 is a staggered release so it’ll roll out over the coming days and weeks. The Chrome installer for macOS, Windows and Linux is available for download directly from google.com/chrome. The full list of developer and user-facing features, improvements and fixes in Chrome 54 is provided in the official changelog. Upcoming Chrome and Chromium blog posts will detail all of the “new features and big efforts” in Chrome 54, as per Google. Chrome 55 for Mac is arriving in late November with under-the-hood improvements that will speed up your browsing as the browser will no longer take up as much memory on websites that use JavaScript as does the current stable version.

Christian Zibreg fixed Prasoon Singh Been using Safari for a while. Might go back to Chrome now since the update came out. Jack Wong I left Chrome for Safari because Chrome was a memory monster… I have 8GB ram on my MacBook Air, and Chrome were using almost ~3GB… if 1 tab crashed, I have to end the Chrome program anyway… I don’t see any benefit of using that much memory for each tab. I will stick with Safari for personal and Firefox for work. Rolf Bause The new Chrome is supposed to use a lot less memory (haven’t tried myself tho). I personally use Opera and Safari. Jack Wong I remember it was an update regarding this last year from v45 or 43, but I did not see much difference… And I really like the 2 fingers gesture from Safari, view all tabs and zoom in(smoothly). I need Firefox because of the video extract plugin. JohnS Awesome! So as long as I am willing to allow Google to upload transcripts of every and all conversations I have within earshot of my computer to their servers for processing I can avoid flash on old videos?! Where do I sign up for this? *Oh and in case someone takes this the wrong way, I’m aware there are ways to disable the rogue module that installs itself on first run. But still, it’s a disturbing trend nevertheless that will cause me to stay away from Chrome. Rowan09 Flash is dead, finally.

They don’t have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video – and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Google and Apple are using “machine learning” to help you organize your photos and video easier. Google Apple’s tools are part of last month’s iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories – and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: Apple’s memories Apple’s new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file – so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple’s app created a “Florida to Illinois” package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a “Together” package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an “At The Beach” package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to “Related.” You can also add or delete images within Memories – in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let’s face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren’t necessarily ones I’d choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. Google’s Assistant Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady – without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation – although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn’t require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes, such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called “Rediscover this day.” Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you’ll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. Searching Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. Storage To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition – good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple’s iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos. © 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The iPhone 7 is perhaps the most divisive iPhone ever, thanks to its infuriating decision to remove the headphone jack, causing more people to consider the alternative operating system. However, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, one of the flagship Android phones, is literally bursting into flames. Seems like a no-win situation. However, while the glut of different Android phones has its drawbacks (fragmentation mostly) the upside is you’re not limited to one questionable piece of hardware if you want a phone powered by that little green robot. So, with Android Nougat out and the holidays closer than you think, here are five upcoming Android phones worth waiting for. And if you’re impatient, we’ve also included links to great phones that are available right now. Google Pixel Phone The last time we updated this list we highlighted Google Project Ara, a completely modular smartphone that would allow users to customize nearly all aspects of the device. It sounded almost too good to be true, so it wasn’t too surprising when Google cancelled the device a few weeks ago. But if you’re jonesing for a Google Android phone fear not. On October 4 Google will roll out its new line of Pixel phones. The HTC-manufactured phone will come in two varieties: the Pixel and the Pixel XL. Leaks suggest at least one of the the phones, probably the XL, will feature either a Snapdragon 820 or a 821 processor with 4GB of RAM and options for 32GB or 128GB of storage. These new, non-Nexus phones will also differ from each in a few ways. Expect the Pixel XL to have a 5.5-inch Quad-HD OLED screen with a 2560×1440 resolution. A fingerprint scanner, 12-megapixel camera, and 8-megapixel front facing camera are also likely as is a 3450mAh battery. The smaller Pixel should feature a 5-inch HD 1080p screen and a 2770mAH battery. You don’t have to wait much longer for these ones. In the meantime we recommend the Google Nexus 6P. Huawei Mate 9 Rumors about Huawei’s upcoming Mate 9 suggest the Chinese company is really trying to take the fight directly to Samsung and Apple with its flagship phone. The different configurations feature between 4GB to 6GB of RAM, 64GB all the way up to 256GB of storage, a 6-inch screen, and a custom Kirin 960 processor. More exciting though is the idea of two 20-megapixel rear cameras and an iris scanner. And thankfully the phone should run stock Android 7, so even with the custom chip you won’t have to worry about some unwieldy custom interface. We should learn more details about the Huawei Mate 9 on November 8. Right now all the pricing rumors are converted from yuan, so estimates are $479 for the cheapest model and $700 for the premium model. In fact, we’re not even sure if the phone will come to America, but fingers crossed! In the meantime we recommend the Huawei Mate 8. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Google Project Ara may be dead, but that wasn’t the only exciting Android innovation the company was working on. Tango is platform designed to turn mobile devices into the perfect augmented reality machines thanks to motion-tracking, depth perception, and area learning. And the first phone to support it, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, launches this fall. In its addition to its Tango functionality, the Phab 2 Pro looks to a be a solid phablet. The Snapdragon 652 processor is “optimized for Tango,” the 6.4-inch QHD screen and 16-megapixel camera should give you a great view at your augmented reality, and the 4050mAh battery “turbo charges.” Other specs include 64GB of storage, 4GB of RAM, a fingerprint scanner, and an 8.9 mm aluminum unibody with “2.5D curved glass.” We’re big fans of augmented reality, especially compared to its VR cousin, so we can’t wait for the tech to be a bigger deal on smartphones. In the meantime we recommend the ZTE ZMax Pro. OnePlus 4 Our sister site PCMag praised the OnePlus 3 (pictured below) for the performance it offered in a $400 phone. Rumors surrounding its successor, the OnePlus 4, suggest this trend will continue. Just look at some of these specs: 256GB of storage, 23-megapixel camera, 8GB of RAM, Snapdragon 830 processor, OLED display, USB-C and NFC support. Now consider all of that in a phone that costs less than $400 and comes with Android 7 Nougat out of the box. We don’t know exactly when we’ll hear more about the OnePlus 4, but we expect it to come out sometime next spring. So you’ll have to wait a little longer, but if the rumors are true, it might be worth it. In the meantime we recommend the OnePlus 3. Nokia’s Android Phone, the C1? N-Gage aside, Nokia used to be a pretty great phone manufacturer. It was easy to see why Microsoft bought them. However, even the best Lumia phone in the world couldn’t make up for the fact that Windows Phone as a platform was never going to compete with Android or iOS. The devices languished and Nokia was once again sold. Fortunately, unshackled from Microsoft Nokia is once again free to make smartphones with operating systems users want. And the company is wasting no time putting together a new Android phone, the C1, that should be coming sometime next year. Details are scarce, but leaked details and photos suggest the device will have an Intel Atom chipset and a 5-inch 1080p screen. It also might run Android 6 Marshmallow instead of the latest Android 7 Nougat, but missing out on the latest software is a problem Android users have had years to make peace with. We don’t know when we’ll hear more about the C1, or the two other rumored Nokia Android phones, but hopefully soon! In the meantime we recommend the HTC 10.

PLCN is expected to handle some 120 terabytes of data per second, enough capacity to enable 80 million high-definition video conference calls simultaneously between Los Angeles and Hong Kong, said Google network infrastructure director Brian Quigley. Google and Facebook are working with Pacific Light Data Communication Company and with undersea communications technology firm TE SubCom on the cable, which was scheduled to be ready in mid-2018, according to a joint release. “PLCN will be among the lowest-latency fiber optic routes between Hong Kong and the US and the first to connect directly using ultra-high-capacity transmission,” PLDC chairman Wei Junkang said. “It is certainly gratifying that global technology companies like Google and Facebook have become co-investors in PLCN.” Most Pacific subsea cables stretch from the U.S. to Japan, according to Facebook vice president of network engineering Najam Ahmad. “As the number of people using Facebook apps and services continues to grow in the region, PLCN will help further connect Asia and our data centers in the U.S.,” Ahmad said. “This new direct route will give us more diversity and resiliency in the Pacific.” Lifestyles increasingly centered on access to cloud-based online services as well as to video, pictures and other content on the internet have increased the need for infrastructure capable of quickly and efficiently moving digital data. PLCN will be the sixth submarine cable in which Google has an ownership stake, according to Quigley. The U.S. internet giant claimed to have the “largest network backbone of any public cloud provider.” Microsoft and Facebook early this year teamed together to lay a high-speed Internet cable across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The subsea “MAREA” cable was expected to be completed by late 2017, with the aim of meeting growing demand by the tech companies' customers for fast, reliable data connections. MAREA was expected to have a capacity of some 160 terabytes per second of data, according to the companies. The 6,600-kilometer cable system will also be the first connecting the United States and southern Europe, running from Northern Virginia to Bilbao, Spain, Microsoft and Facebook said.

According to the latest Transparency Report from Mountain View, Calif.-based Google, government requests for user data rose from 40,677 in the second half of last year to 44,943 requests during the first half of 2016. US Government Leads Requests Google provided information in 64 percent of those requests, unchanged from the second half of last year, according to a blog post by Richard Salgado, director of Law Enforcement and Information Security at Google.  US government officials accounted for 14,168 of the requests made. Google provided information on 79 percent of the cases. Germany came in second with 8,788 requests. Google provided information on 59 percent of the cases. France placed third with 4,300 requests, followed in fourth and fifth by India and the UK, respectively. 'Limited Info' Provided With such a high rate of compliance, particularly in the US, it would seem that the requests are easy to fulfill. But Salgado argued that point, adding that only limited information is provided. “When we receive a request for user information, we review it carefully and only provide information within the scope and authority of the request.  The privacy and security of the data that users store with Google is central to our approach.  Before producing data in response to a government request, we make sure it strictly follows the law,” he said. In criminal cases, for example, Google requires a search warrant to limit government intrusion. Microsoft Gets Fewer Requests The update to Google’s Transparency Report comes just two weeks after Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft updated its report. That report showed fewer government requests for user data during the first six months of 2016. Overall, Microsoft received 35,572 requests for data from law enforcement agencies, down eight percent from the the second half of 2015. Just over 2.5 percent of law enforcement requests resulted in the disclosure of content customers created, shared or stored on Microsoft services. Like Google, Microsoft only discloses content after a court order or warrant. Microsoft Files Suit In a blog post about the requests, Steve Lippman, director of Corporate Responsibility at Microsoft, said the US government typically issues orders that require email providers to keep data requests secret. “In April, we filed a lawsuit against the US government challenging what we believe is the routine use of secrecy orders, which prevent us — often indefinitely — from notifying some individuals when the government seeks their data. We believe that with rare exceptions consumers and businesses have a right to know when the government accesses their emails or records,” he wrote. He adds that in many cases these secrecy orders contain no fixed end date.  The case is one to watch and it’s not just Microsoft. Apple, Google, Amazon, Mozilla, Salesforce and LinkedIn have all signed friend-of-the-court briefs in this case. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Kentico’s New Cloud CMS Is Headless, Thoughtful and Affordable Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Domo Strikes New Low in Vendor Competition Everything You Thought You Knew About User Experience Is Wrong How API Integrations Help Your Back Office Work Faster, Smarter Enterprise Search Means Finding Information, Not Just Documents Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers AvePoint Adds File Sync & Share for Microsoft SharePoint Alfresco Primes Its Activiti Pump Useful Article?

December’s Update Promises to Use 50% Less Memory By Rafia Shaikh Posted 1 month ago 42Shares Share Tweet Submit Google is planing to release a new version of Chrome in December, this year. The new Chrome 55 will give your devices some of the memory back that Chrome routinely takes away, as it aims to significantly reduce its memory footprint. Google has been working to reduce Chrome’s demands on your machines. The web browser, while immensely popular, is also notorious for being resource-hungry. Earlier, Google worked on lowering the battery usage of its browser. Now, the team is focusing on Chrome’s memory hogging habits. In a blog post, the engineering team has shared how the upcoming Chrome 55 will include an upgraded JavaScript engine that reduces the memory footprint. Since modern websites thrive on JavaScript, the new changes will lead to dramatic improvements. The team explained that by tweaking the V8 Javascript engine and manually coding some fixes, it has managed to achieve some impressive results. Chrome 55 promises to use less RAM, especially on mobile devices Memory consumption is an important dimension in the JavaScript virtual machine performance trade-off space. Over the last few months the V8 team analyzed and significantly reduced the memory footprint of several websites that were identified as representative of modern web development patterns. The company boasted that its test sites, including the New York Times, Reddit and YouTube, used 50 percent less RAM on average when compared to Chrome 53. These changes will result in a better and faster browsing experience on devices that don’t have much memory, and also when we are juggling between tens of tabs in our browser. The team further said it’s working to improve the browsing experience, especially in lightening the load for entry-level mobile devices that have 512MB to 1GB of memory. “Over the next months we will continue our work on reducing the memory footprint of V8. We have more zone memory optimizations planned for the parser and we plan to focus on devices ranging from 512M-1G of memory,” the blog post read. Advertisement Earlier in the year, Microsoft published test results showing how its Edge browser is faster and more resource-efficient than Chrome. Google’s Chromium team has since started to focus on improving the browser and especially reducing its resource consumption.

While the Pixel and Pixel XL have most of the same specs, Apple pulled out a few more stops in its 7 Plus flagship. Size The Pixel isn't so XL next to the iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone is a few millimeters taller and wider than its Google-made counterpart. Weight The iPhone is not just bigger, it's also more dense, weighing in at 11-percent more than the Pixel. That's not enough to break your back, but it is quite a bit of difference as far as two similarly sized smartphones go. Build These phones don't push any boundaries when it comes to construction. While we're not exactly excited about seeing another take on a streamlined aluminum unibody, we're not complaining about it, either. Colors The iPhone has more color variants than Google's flagships, though the Pixel's blue version stands out from the neutral-and-metallic crowd. Water resistance You don't have to kiss your iPhone goodbye if it accidentally goes for a swim. The IP67 rating means it can withstand immersion in up to one meter of water for as long as 30 minutes. On the other hand, Google is a little behind the curve when it comes to water resistance. Display size The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus both have 5.5-inch phablet-sized displays. Display resolution Yes, the Pixel XL display has more pixels. Its pixel density is 28-percent greater than the iPhone 7 Plus display, which will come in handy for powering a virtual reality headset (read on). Still, there are other qualities – white balance, contrast, color saturation – that make the iPhone's display quite lovely. Display type Apple is one of the few smartphone manufacturers clinging to IPS technology. Google follows the herd and opts for AMOLED, with its truer blacks and saturated colors. Pressure-sensitive display All current iPhones (with the exception of the SE, which is a bit of a throwback) have pressure-sensitive displays, which gives you more ways to interact with the touchscreen beyond simple tapping. Apple dubs this technology "3D Touch". Camera megapixels The two phones have equal resolution in the rear-facing cameras, but the Pixel packs a bigger punch in the front camera. Read: sharper selfies. Dual lens camera The iPhone 7 Plus has a killer camera feature that the Pixel XL does not: a dual-lens rear camera that enables 2x optical zoom and increased digital zoom. Check out our iPhone 7 Plus review for some photo examples. Camera aperture (rear) This year, we saw several smartphone manufacturers grow increasingly competitive in the race for larger camera apertures. Among other things, larger apertures let in more light, helping you get better captures when environmental light is low. The lower the f-stop, the bigger the aperture, so the iPhone 7 Plus has an advantage here. Optical image stabilization Optical image stabilization, or OIS, is a kind of camera engineering that counteracts the shakiness of your hands while you're taking pictures. It's absent from the Pixel, but it's a nice addition to the iPhone's low-light shooting arsenal. Battery The Pixel XL's jumbo battery trounces the iPhone's in size. There are many other factors in determining battery life, but the Pixel XL does seem to have more staying power overall. According to Google, the Pixel XL offers up to 32 hours of talk time or 14 hours of internet use/video playback. By Apple's count, the 7 Plus can dole out up to 21 hours of talk time, 13 hours of internet use, or 14 hours of video playback. Fast charging The Pixel can get up to 7 hours of use from a 15-minute charge. iPhone charging is not so expedient. Wireless charging Neither flagship can be charged without a cable: USB-C for the Pixel and a Lightning cord for the iPhone. Processor Both phones have ample processing power, but the iPhone 7 Plus clocks in faster. RAM Apple finally upped the RAM in its fleet of flagships, but the iPhone 7 Plus still has less memory than the Pixel XL. Storage Both phones are available with 32 or 128 gigabytes of storage, which should be ample for most users. Apple also offers a capacious 256-gigabyte option for power users. microSD If you were crossing your fingers for an iPhone alternative with external storage, you'll need to look elsewhere. The iPhone 7 Plus is not expandable, which is no surprise, but many had different hopes for Google's first phablet. VR-ready If you want to join the masses already using mobile virtuality reality (VR) headsets, steer clear of the iPhone. The Pixel XL, on the other hand, is compatible with Google's recently launched and fairly affordable Daydream View. Headphone jack Even though Apple has been liberal with the axe, headphone jacks have not gone the way of the dinosaur just yet. Pixel XL has a dedicated jack for your ear candy. Fingerprint sensor The fingerprint sensor is becoming ubiquitous: We can't think of one mid-range or high-end phone released this year that doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. The Pixel's sensor is on the back, and the iPhone's sensor is built into the home button on the front. Home button Like most Android phones, Pixel XL has an onscreen home button with a back button on the left and a recent apps button on the right. The iPhone 7 Plus has a uniquely Apple solid-state home button with haptic feedback for your pressing pleasure. It's positioned below the display, so it doesn't take up any onscreen real estate. Mobile payments No surprises here – Pixel XL's equipped with Android Pay, and the iPhone 7 Plus has Apple Pay. Merchants that are mobile payment-ready can often accept either, since they have similar requirements. Virtual assistant The Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phones with Google Assistant built in. Google Assistant is being billed as a more intelligent and powerful alternative to Siri, so we will be sure to test its full capabilities in our upcoming Pixel review. Operating system The iPhone 7 Plus launched with iOS 10, but since Apple pushes software updates onto all iPhones, you can count on that operating system being continuously updated until the phone goes kaput. Not all Android phones get the latest and greatest software updates, but the Pixel will be at the front of the line. As a Google-branded phone, it launches with the brand new Android 7.1 Nougat and will receive all updates for at least two years and security updates for at least three years. Release Apple released the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus just weeks before Google launched the Pixel and Pixel XL. Starting price (full retail) Like their little brothers the Pixel and iPhone 7, Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus have the same price points, which suggests that Google intends these phones to be direct competitors. The 32 GB models are $769 and the 128 GB models are $869, while the 256 GB iPhone is $969. While the base-level flagships seem neck-and-neck, the differences between these phablets are little more distinct. iPhone 7 Plus has an advantage in terms of camera capability and water resistance, but the Pixel XL is outfitted for perks like VR, proper headphones and fast charging.

Google has already introduced algorithmic sorting for Google+, and now it is rolling out to Communities. Just as with Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, the decision to move towards algorithms rather than a simple chronological timeline is one that will be divisive. But Google has made it easy to toggle the setting, helping to keep everyone happy. The new approach to timelines in Communities brings the group section of Google+ in line with how users' timeline work. Once enabled, posts will be sorted according to relevance rather than time of posting, although Google has not revealed quite how relevance will be determined. Announcing the change, Google says: To make sure you never miss out on what's up, we're changing the way Community posts are displayed to show you the good stuff first. Starting today, whenever you visit a Community, you'll see the most high quality, relevant posts up top, rather than the just the most recent ones. Of course, if you'd like to switch back to chronological view, it’s easy to do so from the Community Settings / Preferences menu. The change is rolling out gradually, so you may not see the option straight away. Photo credit:  Twin Design / Shutterstock 3 Comments Tweet Got News?

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google October 10, 2016 Race to Quantum Computing Supremacy should see definitive results in 2018 adiabatic quantum computer, chemistry, computers, dwave, energy, google, machine learning, materials, quantum computers, qubits, science Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit Quantum computing Supremacy is when quantum computers perform computational tasks beyond the capabilities of classical (regular) computers for a significant range of important problems. There are also some proposed technical metrics using cross entropy A critical question for the field of quantum computing in the near future is whether quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined computational task beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers, achieving so-called quantum supremacy. We study the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime using extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42 qubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test. 1. Dwave Systems (has a 2000 qubit system superconducting quantum annealing system) Dwave's next chip will revamp their design. Dwave will likely try to address aspects of qubit coherence time and perhaps error correction to match the competing chips from Rigetti, Google and IBM. 2. Rigetti computing is currently testing a three-qubit chip made using aluminum circuits on a silicon wafer, and the design due next year should have 40 qubits. Rigetti says that’s possible thanks to design software his company has created that reduces the number of prototypes that will need to be built on the way to a final design. Versions with 100 or more qubits would be able to improve on ordinary computers when it comes to chemistry simulations and machine learning. Chad Rigetti was Technical Lead for 3-D quantum computing at IBM Research. He has been building prototype quantum processors for 12+ years. At Yale, he developed the first all-microwave control methods for superconducting qubits, and at IBM built qubits with world-record performance. 3. John Martinis leads the quantum computing research group at the University of California, Santa Barbara He was hired by Google in June 2014 after persuading the company that his team’s technology could mature rapidly with the right support. Google’s project estimates that Martinis’s group can make a quantum annealer with 100 qubits as soon as 2017. The coherence time of Martinis/Google's qubits, or the length of time they can maintain a superposition, is tens of microseconds—about 10,000 times the figure for those on D-Wave’s chip. Using the 49th most powerful computer in the world, the US National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center’s Edison, Google simulated the behaviour of quantum circuits on larger and larger grids of qubits, up to a 6 × 7 grid of 42 qubits. Computing these grids grows exponentially in memory requirements as grids get bigger - a 6 × 4 grid needs just 268 megabytes, while the 6 × 7 grid requires 70 terabytes. A 48-qubit grid would have required 2.252 petabytes of memory, nearly double that of the most powerful computer in the world. This is the problem Google hopes to solve with a 50 qubit quantum computer. Scalable quantum computers will see improvements of thousands of times or more per year in speed. Thus quantum computing will achieve dominance over classical computers and then never give up that dominance. After that, the plan is to grow the number of qubits the computer can handle. “It’s absolutely progress to building a fully scalable machine,” Ian Walmsley at the University of Oxford said. 4. IBM is also developing more stable superconducting quantum qubits. Quantum computing applications Applications for quantum computers include quantum finance, decoding the genome, chemistry, medicine, machine learning and more D-Wave has begun to work with Investment managers on the related problem of designing portfolios. In order to generate the maximum returns for a given risk profile, a fund manager needs to not only choose among the thousands of available securities, but also minimize transaction costs by achieving the most optimal portfolio in the minimum number of trades. In each case, D-Wave’s quantum systems allow us to swallow complexity whole, rather than using shortcuts that reduce efficiency. Jeremy Hilton, Senior Vice President, Systems, at D-Wave says “Complex processes are all around us. By using quantum computing to operate them more effectively, we can make just about everything we do run more smoothly.” Scientists at Harvard have found that quantum computers will allow us to map proteins much as we do genes today. D-Wave has also formed a partnership with DNA-SEQ to use its quantum computers to explore how to analyze entire genomes to create more effective therapies. Mapping the human genome was a triumph of technology as much as it was an achievement in biology. It was, essentially, more powerful computers that allowed us to map human DNA . However, if we are to advance further, quantum systems will likely be a big part of the answer. Rigetti cites the Haber-Bosch process, used to manufacture ammonia for fertilizer production, which has been estimated to consume 2 percent of the world’s energy. Devising a more efficient catalyst for the reaction could be extremely valuable. Rigetti aims to ultimately set up a kind of quantum-powered cloud computing service, where customers pay to run problems on the company’s superconducting chips. Quantum computing can provide a major acceleration to the improvement and capabilities in machine learning. Quantum computing will help in all areas where complexity and large search domains are slowing progress. This includes finding new materials and making systems more efficient.

Google Photos will now help you rediscover old memories by surfacing older photos of people that also appear in your more recent photos. It’ll also point out highlights in your most recent photos. For example, if you take lots of photos of a child, Google Photos will highlight some from the past month that it thinks are the best. The Google Photos AI is also going to help you make more GIFs. Google Photos has always made GIFs from your photos, but now it’ll also make GIFs from your videos by looking for segments that capture an activity. These GIFs can then be easily shared. Finally, Google Photos will search for sideways images and give you a card that’ll highlight all of them. You can then simply tap on the photo to make them right side up. These are some nice updates to Google Photos. The rotation of sideways images is nice because not only does it mean that you won’t end up scrolling through your photos and then randomly stumble on a sideways image, but it also saves you time by just letting you tap to rotate a photo rather than diving into a photo editing interface. Then there’s the video-to-GIF feature that takes the work out of creating custom GIFs, which are pretty popular right now.

There has been an Easter egg in every new version of Android since Gingerbread. Google Search is also full of Easter eggs (this one is our favorite). So it’s no surprise that Google Assistant has Easter eggs, but we were blown away by the amount that we found with some simple trial and error. A lot of the humor behind these Easter eggs is from the folks at The Onion and Pixar, which Google hired to add some life to the Assistant. We were able to find the 37 Easter eggs listed below (including comments about Apple), but you can probably find more on your own. Check out the video below to see Assistant’s responses. List of questions to ask: What is love? What is the first rule of Fight Club? Why is 6 afraid of 7? Hodor Do you Yahoo? Do you like the iPhone? Use the force May the force be with you What goes up but never comes down? Do you know the muffin man? Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego Why did the chicken cross the road? Who let the dogs out? Open the pod bay door How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? How many roads must a man walk down? What is your favorite dessert? Do you like to exercise? Where is waldo? Make me a sandwich Who’s on first? Aren’t you a little short for a Storm Trooper? You want the truth? Is your name Hal? What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? To be or not to be? Mirror mirror on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all? What do you mean, I’m funny? Why is a raven like a writing desk? Wherefore art thou Romeo? How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased? What would you do for a Klondike bar? How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie-Pop? Do you know the way to San Jose? What’s in a name?

Google Trends shows that, recently, and especially in the past seven days, searches for "write-in" have been increasing.  According to CNN, Google searches for "write-in" have risen in the U.S. in the past week by more than 2,800 percent, while candidate specific searches "write-in Bernie Sanders" and "write-in Mike Pence" have spike by 2,750 percent and 2,400 percent, respectively. In Ohio specifically, searches for "write in" have increased over the past week. Although correlation does not necessarily mean causation, the spike does coincide with the release of tapes of Donald Trump making lewd comments about women and with the Wikileaks release of more of Hillary Clinton's deleted emails. Searches for Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who faced off against Clinton for the Democratic nomination, have also been increasing in the state. Meanwhile, searches for "write in Mike Pence" spiked around the release of Trump's tape and the subsequent debate, but have calmed since then. Again, correlation does not mean causation, but the apparent increase in searches for "write in" as the contentious election nears could indicate that this election will see an increase in the number of non-nominee votes. 2012 had the highest number of write-in votes for an election thus far, with write-ins accounting for 0.11 percent of the vote.

Google Pixel, Pixel XL pre-orders start on Flipkart Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones are available for pre-orders on Flipkart starting today, though only three variants of the total eight are listed on the website presently. The only models available for advanced bookings are the 32GB Quite Black Pixel, 128GB Quite Black Pixel, and 128GB Quite Black Pixel XL. Flipkart is promising delivery of the phones by October 25.Samsung reassures users that Galaxy S7 is safe Mired in controversy surrounding the exploding Galaxy Note 7, Samsung is trying to reassure owners of Galaxy S7 that their handsets are safe. The company is reportedly sending push messages to Samsung Galaxy S7 users that their phones are safe and not affected by the recall. Airtel launches 100Mbps broadband service Airtel has launched a super-fast broadband service called V-Fiber that offers Internet speeds up to 100Mbps; Chennai is the first city to get this. The company has also expanded its unlimited free voice calling facility, earlier available on select plans, to all broadband plans it provides. Mobile manufacturers ask government to defer mandatory panic button rollout Handset manufacturers have requested the government to defer the deadline for implementation of panic button in mobile phones to April 1. The reason cited for the delay is that mobile phone manufacturers are unable to test the feature with proposed single emergency number 112, which is not operational at present. Sony launches premium KD-65Z9D 4K HDR TV at Rs. 5,04,900 Sony has launched the new KD-65Z9D 4K HDR TV in India, with a price tag of Rs. 5,04,900.

The Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) will stretch 12,800km, crossing beneath the Pacific Ocean in a first-of-its-kind direct connection between the two locations, according to companies involved with the project. The PLCN is expected to handle about 120 terabytes of data per second, enough capacity to enable 80 million high-definition video conference calls simultaneously between Los Angeles and Hong Kong, Google network infrastructure director Brian Quigley said. Google and Facebook are working with Pacific Light Data Communication Co (太平洋光纜數據通訊) and with undersea communications technology firm TE SubCom on the cable, which is scheduled to be ready in the middle of 2018, according to a joint release. “PLCN will be among the lowest-latency fiber optic routes between Hong Kong and the US, and the first to connect directly using ultra-high-capacity transmission,” PLDC chairman Wei Junkang (魏俊江) said. “It is certainly gratifying that global technology companies like Google and Facebook have become coinvestors in PLCN,” Wei said. Most Pacific subsea cables stretch from the US to Japan, according to Facebook vice president of network engineering Najam Ahmad. “As the number of people using Facebook apps and services continues to grow in the region, PLCN will help further connect Asia and our data centers in the US,” Ahmad said. “This new direct route will give us more diversity and resiliency in the Pacific,” Ahmed added. Lifestyles increasingly centered on access to cloud-based online services as well as to video, photographs, and other content on the Internet have increased the need for infrastructure capable of quickly and efficiently moving digital data. PLCN will be the sixth submarine cable in which Google has an ownership stake, Quigley said. The US Internet giant claimed to have the “largest network backbone of any public cloud provider.” Microsoft Corp and Facebook earlier this year teamed together to lay a high-speed Internet cable across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The subsea “MAREA” cable is expected to be completed by late next year, with the aim of meeting growing demand by the tech companies’ customers for fast, reliable data connections. MAREA is expected to have a capacity of about 160 terabytes per second of data, according to the companies. The 6,600km cable system will also be the first connecting the US and southern Europe, running from northern Virginia to Bilbao, Spain, Microsoft and Facebook said.

And now, Google's DeepMind division, known for creating the AI that managed to beat a Go world champion earlier this year, has added to that list. The division's AI system has learned to navigate the London Underground by combining an external memory with deep-learning, whereby the program learns to carry out tasks by itself without the input of human-programmed rules. It's this approach which makes the development notable, as many programs are already capable of identifying routes on maps. Related: What is Google DeepMind? The added external memory enabled the system to store important pieces of information and access them when required, in much the same way as humans use a short-term memory repository to carry out complex tasks that involve numerous steps. Using this method, the AI was able to identify the quickest route between Underground stops as well as where it would be if it travelled a certain number of stops in a specific direction from a particular station. The study will be published in the journal Nature, with the authors of the paper explaining: "Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data". Alex Graves, the research scientist at who led the work, told The Guardian: “I’m wary of saying now we have a machine that can reason. We have something that has an improved memory – a different kind of memory that we believe is a necessary component of reasoning. It’s hard to draw a line in the sand.” The team also carried out another task which involved providing the system with details of a family tree and asking it to identify how a particular person was related to another. DeepMind's achievement means it will be easier to apply deep learning to more complicated tasks in the future – tasks that were previously thought to be too difficult for such a system.

Sony, Google and mainstream VR Andrew Fraser , afraser@stcloudtimes.com 11:23 a.m. CDT October 13, 2016 PlayStation VR headset, compatible with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro. (Photo: Sony, playstation.com) So far, virtual reality has been divided into two camps: high-end and mobile. High-end headsets, such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, start at $599 and require a relatively powerful computer to run. Mobile virtual reality has been anchored by Google Cardboard and Gear VR, headsets that act as a head mount for compatible smartphones. These setups are inexpensive, but can be limited by the quality of the phone display and the device’s power. New options from Sony and Google look to blur the lines and bring VR closer to mainstream. PlayStation VR This week, Sony launched its virtual reality headset and platform, PlayStation VR. Compatible with PlayStation 4 consoles and the upcoming PlayStation 4 Pro, PlayStation VR brings the high-profile experience, at a lower price. Not that PlayStation VR is cheap, mind you. The headset, which starts at $399, requires a PlayStation 4 console ($299) and camera ($59) to run, bringing the total buy-in for completely new players to at least $750. Sony also sells a “launch bundle” containing the headset, camera, two Move controllers and the PlayStation VR Worlds game for $499.  The bundle is the best option for players with a PlayStation 4 consoles but none of the VR-ready accessories. Bundles including a Rift or Vive and compatible computer appear to start around $1,400, so the PlayStation VR package is a good option for users that want to try high-end VR but can’t afford the outlay for a PC-based setup. Though it’s less expensive than other top-end competitors, the PlayStation VR hardware holds its own. The headset is extremely comfortable to use and, though it has a lower resolution screen than the Rift or Vive, has less of a screen door effect because of its use of an OLED screen with more subpixels. ST. CLOUD TIMES New PlayStation 4 goes Pro Sony is counting on its relationship with developers to drive content and new titles for PlayStation VR. Launch titles worth checking out are Batman: Arkham VR, RIGS Mechanized Combat League, EVE: Valkyrie, Job Simulator, PlayStation VR Worlds, Rez Infinite, Thumper and Until Dawn: Rush Blood. I was blown away by the experience PlayStation VR provided. I felt fully immersed in the virtual worlds, enough to flinch at jumpy moments or feel anxious during dicey scenes. The high level of presence means I definitely will be giving any horror games a hard pass. Sony has found an acceptable price for PlayStation VR, but the platform will need a stream of quality titles to sustain interest. The real test for content will be after the holiday season. Google Daydream Google’s Cardboard platform brought low-level virtual reality to mobile phone users. It worked with almost any phone and the “headsets” were made from a variety of materials and had varying quality. With Daydream, the company is looking to take the next step. Daydream is Google’s initiative toward simplifying virtual reality. Where the Rift, Vive and PSVR are a mess of cables, expensive controllers and high cost, Daydream aims to be portable, easy to use and compatible with modern smartphones. Daydream will require devices and headsets to meet certain specifications to label themselves compatible. The platform will have a base app, called Daydream Home, that acts as a hub for users to discover and launch content. Google has designed a new headset for Daydream, called Daydream View. It functions similarly to Cardboard, but is made of a soft material for better comfort. The View headset also comes with a small controller for motion controls and navigation.  The controller can be used to expand the experiences beyond looking around in 3D. Daydream View will be available in November for $79. ST. CLOUD TIMES Google is taking on all comers The first Daydream-ready devices will be Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, due out Oct. 20. Google is giving consumers who purchase a Pixel phone through certain retailers a free Daydream View headset, an offer worth considering if you’re interested in the platform. Like Sony, Google will need to keep content flowing to its VR platform to see long-term growth. The expenses involved with bringing quality VR home are high, so these companies will need to make sure consumers get return value. This is the opinion of Times Digital Project Specialist Andrew Fraser.

A pop up (via Android Police) on both mobile and desktop asks if users want to pre-order the Pixel with a link to learn more about the device. Past promotions for Google’s hardware were much bolder than a simple pop up on the bottom right corner of desktops. Advertising for the company’s first tablet featured a Nexus 7 peeping up from underneath the page. Meanwhile, the Nexus One and other phones were linked to just underneath the search bar. The ad is rather prevalent and will remain there between visits until you take an action on it. Tapping “Yes Please” will direct users to the Pixel product page on the new Made by Google site and not the Google Store order page. A pop up is likely much more noticeable than small text underneath the search box, which at the moment is promoting Cyber Security Month. Presumably, we’ll see more advertisements for the Pixel on the Google homepage throughout the year. The company has been plastering cities like London and New York with Pixel billboards, posters, and even structures.

Google Chrome is beschikbaar voor Windows, Linux en macOS. Er zijn ook versies voor Android en iOS, maar die volgen een iets ander releaseschema. Sinds versie 50 is de ondersteuning voor oudere versies van Windows en macOS vervallen. In versie 54 treffen we onder meer ondersteuning aan voor custom elements volgens de nieuwe V1-specificatie en is er een nieuwe api die communicatie tussen schermen, tabs, iframes en dergelijke makkelijker moet maken. Daarnaast zijn er diverse kleinere verbeteringen aangebracht en de nodige bugfixes doorgevoerd.  De belangrijkste verbeteringen zijn hieronder nog eens voor je op een rijtje gezet. Custom Elements V1 Complex user interfaces often require a large amount of HTML. Most languages allow developers to create their own components built on top of language primitives to mitigate this kind of verbosity. Custom elements allow developers to create their own custom HTML tags, and define the new element’s API and behavior in JavaScript. This enables a browser-native way to build reusable, interoperable components. Chrome 54 provides support for the latest custom elements V1 spec, which is broadly agreed-upon by major browser vendors. Chrome will also continue to support the V0 API until enough developers have moved to V1. BroadcastChannel It is not uncommon for desktop users to have multiple windows or tabs open simultaneously. Some sites utilize this behavior, such as web editors that open documents in their own tabs. Historically, communicating between those tabs has been difficult. BroadcastChannel is a new one-to-many messaging API between windows, tabs, iframes, web workers, and service workers. It allows scripts to establish named channels to send messages between browsing contexts of the same origin. Media platform improvements on Chrome for Android Media is an increasingly large and important part of the browsing experience on mobile devices that requires fluidly utilizing the entire screen. Developers can now use Element.requestFullScreen() to trigger full screen mode after a screen orientation change in addition to after a user gesture. This allows experiences like rotate-to-fullscreen for media players. In addition to fullscreen improvements, Chrome on Android now persists the media notification of a backgrounded HTMLVideoElement, allowing a user to continue playing videos while they aren’t visible. Developers can detect background video playback by using the Page Visibility API. Other features in this release Navigations initiated in an unload handler will be blocked and any prior navigation will continue. The imageSmoothingQuality attribute for CanvasRenderingContext2D allows developers to balance performance and image quality by adjusting resolution when scaling. Sites can use Node.getRootNode(options) to obtain the root for a given node. Using PushSubscription.options, sites can track applicationServerKeys without having to store them offline. The Resource Timing API now supports transfer, encoded, and decoded size attributes, allowing developers to measure cache hit rates and byte usage. The user-select property enables developers to specify which elements can be selected by the user and how. Foreign Fetch and WebUSB are available for experimentation as origin trials. The text-size-adjust property allows sites to control whether font size automatically scales on mobile devices. Deprecations and interoperability improvements To match behavior in other browsers, embedded YouTube Flash players will be rewritten by Chrome to use the HTML5 embed style, improving performance and security on Chrome Desktop. CacheQueryOptions now conforms to spec across all CacheStorage methods. initTouchEvent has been removed in favor of the new TouchEvent() constructor. SVGZoomEvent has been removed as it is no longer part of the SVG 2.0 spec. SVGSVGElement.currentView, SVGSVGElement.useCurrentView, SVGViewSpec interface, and SVGSVGElement.viewport have been removed as they are no longer part of the SVG 2.0 spec. SVGTests.requiredFeatures attribute has been deprecated since it no longer provides useful functionality in the SVG 2.0 spec. SVGElement now supports the dataset property. The KeyEvent.keyIdentifier field has been removed in favor of the KeyboardEvent.key field. window.external.IsSearchProviderInstalled() and AddSearchProvider() are now no-ops, since they are unsupported in most other browsers.

INNOVATE Google, Facebook Partner Up to Deliver Crazy Fast Internet An 8,000-mile cable will be the most powerful to ever span the Pacific. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a reporter for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Reporter, Inc.@wheresKR WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Google and Facebook are forming a powerful alliance. The two companies are going in on a project to build an internet cable that spans the floor of the Pacific Ocean, according to The Verge. The 8,000-mile cable will run from Los Angeles to Hong Kong with a bandwidth of 120 terabits per second--making it the most powerful internet connection between the U.S. and Asia. Currently, the fastest transpacific internet cable is the Faster, which delivers 60 terabits per second and is also partially owned by Google. Google and Facebook might compete for internet eyeballs, but it's not uncommon for tech giants to team up on this kind of venture. The massive amounts of traffic they serve and data they send means it makes financial sense to own the cables they run on instead of buying bandwidth from someone else. The new cable will help provide faster Internet speeds to internet visitors throughout Asia. Facebook and Microsoft recently teamed up on the Marea, which will connect Northern Virginia and Spain and will be the fastest transatlantic cable when it's completed in 2017. Google already owns part of six other underwater cables, including three that span the Pacific and two that service South America via the Atlantic. Facebook and Google both have other ventures to try to spread fast internet throughout the world. Facebook is in the process of launching satellites that can beam Internet down to rural areas. High speed Google Fiber, meanwhile, is already operating in several U.S. cities. The company is also developing Project Loon, which, if successful, will beam the internet to remote areas via balloon. The new Facebook-Google cable will be called the Pacific Light Cable Network. Some estimates put the total cost for the project at $400 million. It's expected to be completed and functioning by 2018.

The fiber-optic cable will have a bandwidth of 120 terabits per second, which Google says makes it the highest-capacity route between the US and Asia. It’ll double the current record, which is held by a cable that Google is also a partner on. The new cable should allow Google and Facebook to offer faster and more reliable service to visitors on the other side of the Pacific. The companies will likely each get a certain chunk of the cable’s total capacity and lease out the remaining space to others; but so far, they haven’t announced the specifics. Facebook has partnered on an even faster cable across the Atlantic These undersea cables are increasingly being built in partnership with big tech companies as those big tech companies come to represent more and more of the internet’s traffic. Facebook and Google both have plenty of data to send just between their own servers, so there’s reason they’d want to have a stake in the connections, rather than being forced to lease everything they need. Facebook, for instance, recently partnered with Microsoft to build an even faster cable across the Atlantic. And for Google, this’ll be the sixth cable it’s taken an ownership stake in. The cable is being called the Pacific Light Cable Network and is expected to be completed and running sometime in 2018. More From The Verge What does a Trump presidency mean for climate change?

An undersea cable nearly 8,000 miles long will link Hong Kong and Los Angeles by 2018, carrying data from Facebook, Google, and others at 120 terabits per second. That will make it the new highest-capacity trans-Pacific route, Google says, a record currently held by another Google-backed cable system that links Japan and the US. TE Connectivity, one of several contractors that will help build the cable, said in a news release that the cable's speed increase is thanks to the addition of a new wavelength for fiber optic transmission. Current cables mostly send data on the "C" band, which is a radio frequency from 4 to 8 GHz, but the new cable will also use the "L" band, from 1 to 2 Ghz. "[The cable] will be among the lowest-latency fiber optic routes between Hong Kong and the U.S. and the first to connect directly using ultra-high-capacity transmission," Wei Junkang, chairman of the Hong-Kong based Pacific Light Data Communication Company, said in a statement. //Related Articles Google Expands Network of Undersea Cables in Asia Facebook, which along with Google is one of the principal investors in the project and will be one of its heaviest users, noted that the cable could provide even more bandwidth in the future. Because each of the partners can use their own transmission technology, they will be able to upgrade the cable's capacity as faster options become available. "This means equipment refreshes can occur as optical technology improves, including taking advantage of advances made during the construction of the system," according to a Facebook blog post. "When equipment can be replaced by better technology at a quicker pace, costs should go down and bandwidth rates should increase more quickly." The cable is mainly intended to link massive data centers. Whether or not Google and Facebook users will see a difference at home or in the office depends largely on the speed of their Internet service provider. Many Asian countries, including Korea and Singapore, have some of the fastest Internet speeds in the world, so the cable could offer them a markedly improved experience.

By James Billington October 13, 2016 16:59 BST China would open its arms to a Facebook and Google return, if they obey the country's lawsREUTERS After Facebook was banned in 2009 and Google decided to pull its search engine out of China in 2010, two of the world's biggest companies have been looking on as the largest internet market on the planet continues to grow. But things may be about to change after the Chinese government revealed it would welcome them both back with open arms, on the one condition: they play by China's rules. Ahead of the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, China – an annual event where the country's government agencies meet to discuss internet policies – the American companies were given the first wink of a return in years according to a report by qz.com. When asked whether they would permit a return, Ren Xianliang, deputy director of the Cyberspace Administration of China replied: "China's internet development has always maintained a policy of openness. As for foreign internet companies, as long as they respect China's laws, don't harm the interests of the country, and don't harm the interests of consumers, we welcome them to enter China, where they can together share the benefits of China's developing internet." The stance from China doesn't seem to have changed, however, except to break the silent treatment and say it is open for the twosome to return and operate their services in the country rather than indefinite banishment. Whether either tech giant would actually do this is another question. The "laws" that were mentioned are still the same laws of censorship that forced Google to withdraw its search engine after the Chinese government wanted to filter certain results. For life without Google (if you could imagine such a thing) those in China use Baidu – a Chinese internet company that fully complies with its country's content laws. Baidu handles over 80% of the country's web traffic for searches as well as offering services akin to Wikipedia, Netflix, Google Maps and Groupon. Then there's Facebook. The social media behemoth would no doubt be constantly policed by Chinese authorities to ensure posts were not speaking out against the Communist Party or portraying the country in a negative light. Despite claiming the "internet is open", a return for either of these companies would most certainly be an augmented version of both services. Yet, the lure of more than double the amount of internet users than in the US may be too much to refuse. Both Facebook and Google have arms of its businesses operating in China and Mark Zuckerberg went on a China tour earlier in 2016 to court officials into a bid to crack into that pool of 668 million internet users. Facebook-owned Oculus is making a huge push with its virtual reality products, which could see a huge uptake in China and Google has its latest Pixel smartphones that it hope will be vying for a slice of China's mobile market. Maybe playing by the rules might not be too hard to swallow after all.

(Photo: Google) SAN FRANCISCO — Getting ready to cast your vote in November? Google has got you covered. The Internet search giant is making it easier for voters to find out what's on the ballot and where their polling place is. Starting Thursday, a search in English or Spanish for "who's on my ballot" will return detailed information about the candidates from president to county commissioner and on ballot measures in your state. Search for "where to vote" and Google will display a polling place location finder and inform you what identification you must bring along. "We are committed to giving people timely and comprehensive information about the voting process so they can better participate in the election and have their voices heard in November," said Jacob Schonberg, a product manager on Google's politics and elections team. Google is responding to popular demand. Search interest for "who is on my ballot" is up 137% compared to this point in 2012, while "where is my polling place" is up 379% and "polling place" is up 216%. Search for "where to vote" and Google will display a polling place location finder and inform you what identification you must bring along.  (Photo: Google) This is just the latest example of popular online hangouts such as Facebook, Twitter,  Snapchat and Google-owned YouTube helping get out the vote. USA TODAY reported last month that Facebook would show Facebook users in the U.S. who are 18 and up a reminder to register to vote at the top of their News Feed over the course of four days. The voter registration drive, Facebook's first to roll out nationwide, tapped the power of social media to influence millions of people and their friends. Nine states credited that Facebook reminder for dramatically boosting voter registrations. Throughout the summer, Google has also been guiding voters to information on how to register and how to vote in English and Spanish, even using pop-up ads on its home page. 3167 CONNECTTWEET 15 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eamwSr

Follow TechnoBuffalo Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 was supposed to be the phone of 2016. Up until units started catching fire, it was far and away the best Android device we’d ever used. No other handset combined design, software, and features into such an elegant, high-end package. It was the closest thing to perfection yet. But it was too good to be true. After being rushed to production, the Note 7 has gone out in a blaze of disappointment, with millions of units ready to be disposed of in same far, forgotten corner of the world. Instead of being our smartphone of the year, it’s one of the industry’s biggest letdowns. Suddenly, Samsung’s next move, whether it be the Galaxy S8 or something else, is more important than ever. Until that device hits—maybe next February—Samsung has the older S7 and S7 Edge, two fantastic devices, to fend off the iPhone 7, Google Pixel, LG V20, Moto Z, and the myriad other options currently on the market. While Apple stands to reap the most from Samsung’s failure, Google and LG could also benefit if they play their cards right. Ahead of the Pixel event, advertising for Google’s then mysterious phone was everywhere, from billboards to statues. In other words, Google was making its intentions crystal clear: watch out, competitors, the Google Pixel is in town. With the Note 7 no longer in the conversation, Google’s task of competing with the largest Android manufacturer is made considerably easier. And if Google can properly educate consumers about the Pixel’s advantages, it just might stand a chance. There’s no question the Note 7’s hardware is superior to the Pixel’s bland design. But Google’s software, from Assistant to unlimited Photos backup, makes for a potent weapon against Samsung’s charred S Pen. That might be more tantalizing to non-geeks than a slightly curved display and an iris scanner. If it’s not Google’s Pixel, LG’s V20 is another high-profile contender that could benefit from the Note 7’s absence. The V10 was quietly one of last year’s best devices and LG has made several improvements with this year’s release. It’s also one of the first devices to run Android 7.0 Nougat. When we released our “Time to KILL the Note 7” video from the other day, we saw a lot of comments about the V20 and how it’s a great alternative. We couldn’t agree more. With a beautiful aluminum design, secondary display, and microSD support, the V20 is a fantastic smartphone that more people need to experience. It certainly has the potential to attract a loyal following and is worthy of a look considering how great last year’s V10 was. It’s unclear how badly Samsung will be affected by the Note 7’s failure. There’s always a chance the several million people who bought the device before the recall will opt for another Samsung device, of which there are many. The Galaxy S7 Edge is essentially the same phone, give or take a few features, while the Note 5 is still fantastic. Samsung has been a dominant, unstoppable force in the Android market over the past few years. But the bigger they are, the harder they fall. With no “current” flagship on the market and its reputation in the gutter (for now), it’s time for a competitor to scale the mountain and challenge Samsung for the Android crown. Which device, if any, do you guys think will pick up the slack over the holiday season?

Amy Gesenhues on October 13, 2016 at 11:32 am More Google is covering all the bases for voters as we near Election Day on November 8. Today, the site rolled out an interactive tool that displays at the top of search results for “who’s on my ballot” and “where to vote” queries. Now “who’s on my ballot” searches will return the following box for users to enter their address. Google then delivers a full list of candidates in the user’s voting district. Searches for “where to vote” returns a similar voting tool that lists polling locations according to the specified address. These voter search tools from Google follow the site’s State-by-State Voting Guide rolled out in August.

SUBSCRIBE Google says Penguin 4.0 rollout now complete If you haven't seen a Google Penguin recovery by now, you may still need to do some link cleanup. Google Penguin 4.0 is now fully rolled out. Barry Schwartz on October 13, 2016 at 9:04 am More The Google Penguin real time algorithm which started rolling out on September 23, 2016, has now rolled out fully to all of Google’s data centers. Google’s Gary Illyes confirmed this on Twitter: @jenstar yes, eh — Gary Illyes (@methode) October 13, 2016 The recovery aspect of this new Penguin algorithm started a bit after September 23 — around September 28. Now that all data centers have the new code, those sites impacted by previous Google Penguin issues should have seen a recovery at some level if they took the necessary steps to clean up their links. As we covered early, Penguin looks at the link source for the most part — so if you still have very spammy links pointing to your site, clean it up. Those hit by any version of Penguin before — including Penguin 1.0 from April 24, 2012, through Penguin 3.0 from October 17, 2014 — should see an impact to their rankings if they made link cleanup efforts. Again, Penguin 4.0, as some are referring to the real-time version of this algorithm, is fully rolled out.

The Pixel and Pixel XL are headed to Verizon in the U.S., and if you were worried about those OTA’s have no fear. One of the main draws to the old Nexus line were the speedy updates from Google. While the names have changed to Pixel, consumers are worried some things will stay the same. Big Red has had a Google Nexus in their arsenal before, but today they have ensured consumers they won’t have to worry about late Pixel phone updates. Initially, news broke that the Verizon Pixel phone updates would be handled by Verizon… not Google. This was cause for concern although that didn’t last long. Verizon confirmed to Ars Technica that they updates will be of the iOS variety on their network. Good news indeed. That means when Google rolls one out whether it’s security or OS related, you will get it at the same time. The carrier will “not stand in the way of any major updates” according to Verizon. In case you’re still in doubt, Google has confirmed that same thing by saying that Verizon and non-Verizon Pixel phone updates will arrive simultaneously. We fully expect the Google Pixel and Pixel XL to be one of the hottest phones around this holiday season, and it should be a popular choice on Big Red, especially with the Note 7 out of the way. If you were on the fence about picking one up through the carrier, it’s time to jump off if updates were holding you back from rolling with Verizon. source: Ars Technica Tags Google Pixelupdatesverizon Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: ZTE Project CSX kicks off and lets you choose the gadget Next article Next post: Nokia D1C tablet appears on the Benchmark listing Adam Adam is a techie, who loves new gadgets and all things Westeros.

Humor is one of the easiest ways to humanize a virtual assistant. Apple has been doing it with Siri since the beginning. Google has taken some notes from Apple and included a bunch of fun Easter eggs in Google Assistant. A couple of which pertain to the folks in Cupertino. Open up a conversation with Google Assistant and try the following questions: Well done. It’s interesting to note that Google is taking a friendly approach to these questions. Siri has been known to throw serious shade when asked about competitors, but Google is taking the high road. Speaking of Siri, Google Assistant has an opinion on her as well. But we’ll leave that one up to you to discover. Have you found any Easter eggs in Google Assistant?

With the launch of its Duo video-chat app, Google continues to move away from its chat service Hangouts. Now, it's taking things one step further by removing Hangouts from the apps that Android partners must install on their devices. As Android Police reports, Google emailed its Mobile Services partners last week to notify them that effective Dec. 1, "Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products." What does this mean for Android users? Basically, those who purchase Google-backed Android phones in the future might not find a pre-loaded Hangouts app. If it's not there, you can still download it from Google Play, though. //Related Articles How to Unlock 9 Hidden Animations in Google Hangouts Android is an open-source platform that any phone maker can use; while Google would prefer that partners pre-load its own apps, they are not required to do so. But it's basically an all-or-nothing proposition. Either you go with the Android Open Source Platform (AOSP) and launch with no Google services, or choose Google and bundle all the apps its requires (Search, Chrome, YouTube, Maps, etc.) It's a strategy that has drawn scrutiny from regulators—phone makers can't mix and match pre-loaded apps from different companies—but it's the only way to get Google Play on a device.

The new version will be rolling out today in the App Store, making it easier to fix some of the pesky sideways photos in your library by suggesting rotations, resurface your forgotten photos for you and more. “Google Photos will now help you rediscover old memories of the people in your most recent photos. As your photo library continues to grow, we hope that features like this one make it easier to look back at your fondest memories,” said Google. These recent highlights from your photos are presented in the app in the form of cards. For example, if you take a lot of photos of your kids, you may occasionally get a card showing the best ones from the last month. This feature can be seen on the screenshot top of post. One of the more interesting features of Google Photos is its ability to automatically create slideshow animations from your best photos. The refreshed app now makes animations from the best parts of your videos, too. Google says its algorithm is looking for segments that capture activity, like a jump into the pool, to create short easily shareable animations. The card concept extends to another new feature: fixing sideways photos. As evidenced by the animation below, when the app identifies sideways photos in your library, a card will pop up helping you easily put them right side up. And last but not least, the new Google Photos app now makes it possible to rotate and trim videos in your library, which is super nice. Recent updates added other features like stabilization for Live Photos and easier sharing of your photos with other people via SMS, email and other options. As shown on the above video, Google has also upped its game when it comes to auto-created movies, which are now based on creative concepts. Here’s an example of Google’s new creative concept for movies in Photos. “These concepts are designed to be the kinds of movies you might make yourself, if you had the time,” says Google. “And they’re not only limited to your most recent uploads.” New concepts will be rolling out over time in the app, said Google.

This was based on what Gary Illyes told us on Twitter. But then someone asked John Mueller of Google answered the question differently. Here is Gary's tweet: @jenstar nope— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 10, 2016 Here is John's tweet: @rjonesx @rjonesx @methode Uhhmm. We do use machine learning in a lot of our systems, so in general, it's a good assumption to make.— John Mueller (@JohnMu) October 12, 2016 So based on Gary, the answer is no. Based on John, we should "assume" yes. So then Gary came in to defend John and Google saying John didn't say Penguin outright uses machine learning: @jroakes John didn't say we used ml in old penguins. To the best of my knowledge we didn't @rjonesx @JohnMu @jenstar— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 12, 2016 Then John came in to explain more: @jroakes @jroakes @methode @rjonesx @jenstar We analyze a lot of data, ML or not. Don't get hung up on the name :).— John Mueller (@JohnMu) October 13, 2016 So then I asked the ranking boss at Google, Paul Haahr, and he said on Twitter "it's complicated." .@rustybrick Very ambiguous question and not a great one for twitter. The most I could say here would be “It's complicated.”— Paul Haahr (@haahr) October 11, 2016 Well, it is complicated to say if most of Google ranking is based on machine learning or not. Maybe I will try to get a better answer from Google in the near future on this topic. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Sitelinks are the popular links you find in Google search results under some of the snippets. Here what I boxed in, in red, are the sitelinks for this search snippet: So if I felt the "about us" link is something that is not worth showing as a sitelink, I would have been able to tell Google - ignore that one and replace it with your next runner up. I cannot longer do that. Google posted this news on Google+ this morning saying "our algorithms have gotten much better at finding, creating, and showing relevant sitelinks, and so we feel it's time to simplify things." So they decided internally to remove the demote sitelinks feature to simplify things. It was actually a feature I used every now and then, so I am a bit surprised they dropped it. Google added this: We only show sitelinks for results when we think they'll be useful to the user. If the structure of your site doesn't allow our algorithms to find good sitelinks, or we don't think that the sitelinks for your site are relevant for the user's query, we won't show them. This process is completely automated. Sitelinks have evolved into being based on traditional web ranking, so the way to influence them is the same as other web pages. Best practices to improve the quality of your sitelinks include: # Provide a clear structure for your website, using relevant internal links and anchor text that's informative, compact, and avoids repetition. # Allow Google to crawl and index important pages within your site. Use Fetch and Render [1] to check that they can be rendered properly. # If you need to remove a page from search completely, use a "noindex" robots meta tag [2] on that page. John Mueller of Google posted about this on Twitter as well and he is taking some heat for the decision. Do you feel that this is a bad move by Google? Forum discussion at Twitter and Google+. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Google: Penguin 4.0 Now Completely Rolled Out   Comments: SEOWeasel 10/13/2016 12:11 pm grrr! google ALWAYS get our sitelinks wrong. Our inventory changes on a daily basis, what was relevant as a sitelink today will not be relevant tomorrow or next week. The sitelink demotion tool worked increasingly less often so I kinda thought that something else was being given more control. I was hoping that the disappearance of the sitelinks tool meant a new and improved version. Very disappointed to hear that now we have to suffer with whatever Google decides. neil77hannam 10/13/2016 02:54 pm If Google has got so much better at determining relevant sitelinks for organic listings, is it fair to assume they'll be removing sitelink extension options in AdWords and let their algorithm pick those where they feel appropriate? I think we all know the answer to that will be a big fat no. Patrick Le Cam 10/13/2016 03:44 pm Bad move. Now and again they really pick the wrong ones and it was quite useful to remove them. Eric 10/13/2016 05:55 pm Had a recent issue where Google was pulling in foreign site URLs for the local version of a .com, had to use GSC to demote them. Can't do that anymore! Thanks Google. Simon Nyström 10/13/2016 06:11 pm Google is better at finding relevant site links? What a joke. Since latest update they show some of the least popular products and pages - worse than ever. (Swedish) Mo Doris 10/13/2016 07:32 pm For large sites this is a nightmare, that's not a rarely used tool. Ben Rush 10/14/2016 01:04 am Ouch, this is going to cause a lot of pain for a lot of webmasters. Personally speaking I find Google very bad at defining good quality site link display, but I've noticed they rarely follow the demotions of late anyway, so chances are the actual real world impact is pretty minimal. Deepak Agnihotri 10/14/2016 06:24 am Sitelink option is not available in my Google Webmaster Tools. So, Google has removed this option from Google Webmaster Tools? Antonino Bologna 10/14/2016 01:32 pm darn... we had a hack a few months back that has been cleaned up though we found a hacked sitelink cached in Google. What happens here? Cody Lueck 10/14/2016 02:54 pm I am kind of disappointed to hear this news. There are certain pages on my website that I would want to show up in the sitelinks that are perhaps not the most popular or prudent. Thomas androws 10/27/2016 11:24 am Read the Post Title!

Search Engine Roundtable     Home Browse by Categories Browse By Dates Search » Turn Off Mobile Site [X] Close Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google: We're Prepared For SEOs Trying To Manipulate Penguin 4.0 Google: We're Prepared For SEOs Trying To Manipulate Penguin 4.0 Oct 13, 2016 • 8:05 am | (17) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next Story Ever since Google announced Penguin 4.0, SEOs began talking about how they are now more eager to try to escalate link buying and other link schemes to see how they can quickly manipulate the algorithm. This is chatter spiked a lot when the news around the disavow and Penguin came out. But Google's Gary Illyes said that Google is prepared for that. He said this in multiple tweets but here are two of them: @AlanBleiweiss @rustybrick @ShahMenz @scottpolk we are prepared for that, but I'm not going to go into details for reasons— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 11, 2016 @beanstalkim @IrishWonder @JohnMu we do have built-in protection for manipulation, keep that in mind ;)— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 12, 2016 It is like we have these SEOs publicly mocking Google and Google telling them don't risk it, don't do it. But knowing SEOs, they will test it and test it and see what happens. It is a bit too early to tell if SEOs feel more comfortable with older link building tactics again. But it would be a shame if Penguin 5.0 was released where it no longer devalues, but also demotes for a period of time based on how bad the link spamming is. Wouldn't that be bad? Forum discussion at Twitter. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Sitelinks Demotion Tool Within Google Search Console Has Been Removed   Comments: Penguin Samurai 10/13/2016 12:38 pm These people are idiots and they deserve what ever is coming for them. Jerry B. 10/13/2016 12:47 pm And when they get smacked by either manual actions or some future update, they will go back to crying about how evil and unfair Google is. Craig Payne 10/13/2016 01:27 pm Yep; I have seen a very big upswing in forum profile spam and spam link drops on my forums in the last week. I really would like to do physical harm to those idiots that do this. Rick 10/13/2016 01:36 pm No they will move on to a new site. Most of the people that still do that have hundreds of sites and test the limits and churn through sites. There is no reason for them to cry to Google. They know what they are risking. The people crying are the people that didn't know what they were doing and likely listened to bad advice or hired someone from BHW to build a link pyramid for them. I'm with Rick 10/13/2016 01:39 pm Exactly Patrick Stox 10/13/2016 02:09 pm My guess is Google would have setup something like this: Monitor incoming links, if number and/or percent of new links are marked as Penguin or noticeable pattern is detected, send for manual review. Michael Martinez 10/13/2016 02:18 pm Anything that scales up should be easier for Google to detect and eventually take into consideration. I suspect Penguin 4.0 makes it easier for them to do that. blackhat 10/13/2016 04:32 pm LOL... Penguin 4 ... so don't build links anymore (like any SEO bh or wh is going to do that)... OH just don't build the "wrong" links. wink wink geeze... what could possibly go wrong? it sounds like a real clusterfuck over at Google. Glad to see they can't be internally consistent for more than a week still. Simon 10/13/2016 05:20 pm Pure speculation of course and others have suggested similar in the past but... I wonder if this is where the 'granular' side fits in. Google says links are devalued rather than demoted, but Google still has to determine which links are manipulated and which are not. Many assume Google is doing this on a link-by-link basis, but it may do this on a pattern/group basis, hence the 'granular' aspect. If multiple links are deemed manipulated, Google may then devalue *all* similar links or indeed all links to that site. A site with negligible link equity (and most likely crappy content if it's involved in that kind of link spam scheme) is unlikely to rank for anything. Simon 10/13/2016 05:49 pm Just seen that Gary has just said at pubcon this is precisely what they'll do. I hadn't seen that when posting. It does re-raise the neg SEO aspect though... Anon User 10/13/2016 06:24 pm That won't tell Jerry. He does not understand that logic. Sam I Am 10/13/2016 07:10 pm Where did you see that? I was a little sleepy during his keynote and may have missed it, but all I recall about that was him saying they don't have a method of flagging sites for manual review based on what Penguin sees. Donald 10/13/2016 07:16 pm You must be new here. There have been many self-proclaimed black hat ninjas bitching about how Google destroyed their "business" over the past year that I have been following this site. Simon 10/13/2016 07:44 pm Multiple people are tweeting about it. Gary said it during his talk. Allegedly. Guest 10/14/2016 08:11 am Please see this comment - Where did you see that? I was a little sleepy during his keynote and may have missed it, but all I recall about that was him saying they don't have a method of flagging sites for manual review based on what Penguin sees. Donald 10/14/2016 12:57 pm LOL. Someone tweeted that Gary said something. Therefore it must be true!

Look at her. Look at her words. And you tell me what you think. I don’t think so,” Trump said of Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporter who alleged he had “forced his tongue down my throat”. Trump denies ‘vicious’ sexual misconduct allegations First lady Michelle Obama delivered a devastating rebuke to Trump, calling past comments and alleged misconduct by the Republican nominee “cruel”, “frightening” and beyond the “basic standards of human decency.” This is not normal, this is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful, it is intolerable, and it doesn’t matter what party you belong to... No woman deserves to be treated this way – none of us deserves this kind of abuse. Michelle Obama’s powerful rebuke to Trump’s ‘predatory behavior’ To get to the facts of the matter, here is a timeline of the allegations by more than a dozen women, many of which have only been made public in recent days. New Jersey governor Chris Christie is facing an official misconduct complaint stemming from the closure of lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge in 2013. A judge signed the summons today, sending the case to the Bergen County prosecutor’s office, which will decide whether the case will lead to an indictment. The Republican governor appointed the prosecutor. Hillary Clinton hinted at a possible landslide in the 8 November election, exhorting several thousand supporters at a San Francisco fundraiser today to help her “have the kind of victory we need” to serve as a “rebuke” to Donald Trump. On a day when Trump went on the attack – calling women who have accused him of inappropriate touching and kissing “horrible, horrible liars” – an increasingly confident Clinton encouraged her backers to double down on their efforts during the final weeks of the fractious 2016 campaign. “Everything we care about is at risk,” she said. “If you can help me to have the kind of victory we need, that stands as a rebuke of all the bigotry and bullying we’ve seen, then together, together we will build the future that all of us, particularly the children of our country, deserve to have.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.43pm EDT 23:43 Speaking to a Linda Ross, a friend of Jessica Leeds, a woman who has accused Donald Trump of physically assaulting her onboard an airline flight in 1979, CNN’s Don Lemon revealed tonight the moment when Leeds decided to come forward with her allegations. “We were sitting together on her couch, and I looked right at her and I said, ‘Oh, my God, Jessica, he just flat out lied right to our faces,’” Ross said, regarding the moment in the second presidential debate in which Trump pledged that he had never sexually assaulted a woman. “I mean, that’s how personal it felt,” Ross continued. “He just flat out lied to our faces, and we were both shaking. We were so angry... She said, ‘I’ll think about it,’ and I went home at the end of the debate. I live two floors below her and the next morning, I got an e-mail from her telling me that she had sent a letter or an e-mail to the New York Times on Monday.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.27pm EDT 23:27 Even the right-tilting New York Post seems to be going bearish on Donald Trump in its woodcut for tomorrow: New York Post (@nypost) Tomorrow's Cover: Donald Trump launches an all-out attack after multiple women accuse him of sexual assault https://t.co/juq3rYptyK pic.twitter.com/3i2NuvINkK October 14, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.18pm EDT 23:18 Poll: Donald Trump's lead in Texas falls to margin of error A new poll in the Lone Star State has Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s lead over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton slipping to a mere four percentage points, within the margin of error in a state that hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential nominee in four decades. The WFAA-TV and Texas TEGNA television stations poll shows Trump holding a four-point lead over Clinton, 47% to Clinton’s 43% in a survey with a four-point margin of error. “I think to put these numbers in context - it shows that Trump’s position has eroded a little bit,” political science professor Matthew Wilson told WFAA. “His lead is down to four percentage points according to this poll, but even in the wake of some really terrible news for him, he still leads in Texas, which shows what a tough nut Texas is to crack for Democratic candidates right now.” Historically, Texas is one of the most blood-red states in the Union: Mitt Romney won Texas by 16% in 2012.

Speaking to a Cincinnati arena filled with roughly 15,000 people tonight, he merely insulted the state’s Republican governor, mocked Hillary Clinton’s health and watched as his supporters treated the press with the same affection that lions in the Coliseum treated Christians. Donald Trump. Photograph: Bryan Woolston/Reuters In the first full day after Trump faced a barrage of accusations of groping and sexual misconduct from nearly a dozen women, the Republican nominee went on the offensive. In a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump insisted that he would never have sexually assaulted one woman who came forward – because she was unattractive. “Take a look. Look at her. Look at her words. And you tell me what you think. I don’t think so,” Trump said of Natasha Stoynoff, a People magazine reporter who alleged he had “forced his tongue down my throat”. The Republican nominee also attacked the New York Times – which reported the statements of two women who alleged Trump groped them. He threatened to sue the paper and insisted he had eyewitnesses who could disprove the New York Times’ reporting. He described the women who alleged sexual assault against him as “horrible people, they’re horrible horrible liars”. Trump insisted that the press as a whole was “false and slanderous in every respect” and said “the depths of their immorality is absolutely unlimited”. The allegations came less than a week after a leaked tape was revealed of Trump bragging about groping women and insisting: “When you are a star they let you do anything.” At the same rally Trump also warned darkly about Clinton meeting “in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers”. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti Defamation League, promptly denounced the statement, which harkened back to antisemitic tropes like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion: Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) .@TeamTrump should avoid rhetoric&tropes that historically have been used ag.

The former Australian prime minister urged “Trump haters” not to get “too excited” over his comments after he told Paul Murray on Sky News that the vast majority of Trump supporters were not deplorables. “[They are] decent people who want to see change inside their country and that’s fair enough,” he said on Thursday night. “Many of the Trump positions are reasonable enough, and there will be tens if not hundreds of millions of Americans who will continue to support some of those positions.” Since tapes surfaced of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, which he later denied, several alleged victims have come forward. The accusations include claims from beauty pageant contestants that Trump burst into their dressing rooms while they were naked. Taking to Twitter on Friday morning, Abbott sought to head off the inevitable reaction to his comments, but instead prompted further rebuke. “Before the Trump haters get too excited, some of his views are OTT but cutting tax and boosting defence are classic conservatism,” he wrote.

Citing issues relevant to Idaho voters ranging from education, immigration and rural issues to gun control and health care, the Idaho Statesman, the state’s most widely circulated newspaper, criticized Trump as insufficiently reliable on conservative issues, or unreliable, period. On health care, for example, “We are confused by Trump’s approach - one day he is going to repeal it, the next he proposes single-payer alternative - but we believe Clinton will work to make the improvements that are absolutely needed.” On more lofty qualifications like communication style and positivity, the Statesman’s editorial board compared Trump to a “spoiled child.” “We live in the real world, with real problems that need real solutions,” the board concludes. “We need someone with pragmatic approaches that include patience and compassion. We need Hillary Clinton to be the next president.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.32pm EDT 22:32 Sean Hannity, in his interview with three women who have accused former president Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape, inferred from their anecdotes on his show that they might fear for their lives if Hillary Clinton were to be elected president. “There’s been so many things happen to so many people connected to the Clintons,” Paula Jones said. “She’s gonna rule the world.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.24pm EDT 22:24 Fox News personality Sean Hannity, who has functioned as an arm of the Trump campaign’s communications strategy since the Republican primaries, held a special on his show tonight in which he interviewed a trio of women who have accused former president Bill Clinton, husband of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, of sexual impropriety. Paula Jones, Kathy Shelton, and Juanita Broaddrick sit in the gallery before at the start of the presidential debate. Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images Donald Trump was originally scheduled to appear on the show, but pulled out of the appearance after more than a dozen accusations of sexual harassment, assault and inappropriate behavior were reported in various media outlets, including the Guardian US, surfaced on Wednesday night. The women - Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey - have long alleged that Bill Clinton committed acts of sexual impropriety toward them, ranging from sexual harassment to sexual assault to rape, and have made a similar appearance on Hannity’s eponymous show in the past. “Back in 1978, when I was working for BC’s campaign for governor, I was raped by Bill Clinton. I was viciously raped,” Broaddrick told Hannity. “And three weeks later, at a fundraiser for him... Hillary personally threatened me.” Clinton has long denied Broaddrick’s claims, and Broaddrick herself submitted an affidavit in 1997 denying that Clinton had made “any sexual advances” towards her. Regarding the alleged threat, Broaddrick said that at a fundraiser for her husband’s gubernatorial campaign, Hillary Clinton “comes straight to me and says to me, big smile, very pleasant voice, says to me, ‘I’m Hillary, it’s so nice to meet you. I just want to thank you for everything you do for Bill’s campaign.’” Clinton then allegedly grabbed her arm and pulled her closer, saying in “a very angry voice, a very low voice, and she pulls me close to her and she says, ‘Do you understand everything you do?’” “I don’t know what she’s capable of.” Jones, a former Arkansas state employee whose lawsuit over allegations of sexual harassment eventually lead to Bill Clinton’s impeachment by the House of Representatives, told Hannity that after she was invited to his room at an Arkansas hotel, Clinton propositioned her and exposed himself to her. “And I said, ‘I’m not that kind of girl, and I need to walk by to my desk,’” Jones said. Clinton then allegedly told her: “You’re a smart girl - let’s keep this between us.’” Clinton settled Jones’ lawsuit out of court for $850,000 without admission of guilt. Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer aide, has alleged since 1998 that Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted her in the Oval Office in 1993. “I headed back out the hall to go back to the door that led into the Oval Office, and he took my coffee cup from me and put it on a desk or table, and next thing I knew, he had me backed into a corner,” Willey told Hannity. “My mind was racing, and I thought, ‘should I slap him, or kick him, or knee him?’” Willey then says that when Clinton was distracted, she then fled the Oval Office.

It actually sounded a lot like what he did [to] the New York Times guy,” another staffer told The Daily Beast, in reference to an incident in which Trump mocked a disabled reporter during a rally. “Like, to make it seem like she was mentally not there? [It] sounded like he got a real kick out of it. It was really upsetting.” “In the boardroom, he would talk to her like she was ‘special,’” another source said. “He took her deafness as a some kind of [mental] handicap.” Matlin eventually placed second in the 2011 season of Celebrity Apprentice.

The weak and feckless foreign policy that Hillary Clinton promises to continue has literally caused wider areas of the world to spin apart. The rise of terrorist threats that have inspired violence here at home, and we’ve seen an erosion of law and order in our streets. And we’ve seen opportunities and jobs evaporate and even leave Ohio and leave this country. I would say to any of our kids that if Donald Trump and I have the chance to serve in the White House that we’re going to work every day for a stronger, safer and more prosperous America. So, in response to a young woman’s questions about Trump’s attitudes toward women, Pence responded with foreign policy, law and order, and lost manufacturing jobs. What’re your thoughts?

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Aol.com Editors Oct 12th 2016 2:09PM Most people know that giving your two-week's notice is the respectful and professional thing to do when quitting a job. But what if you were to give a notice a staggering two years before you planned to leave? SEE ALSO: Apple, Google, Coca-Cola top list of 100 most valuable brands For one former Google employee, doing just that paid off big time. Perhaps honesty is the best policy after all. Liz Wessel was accepted into Google's associate product marketing manager rotational program in 2012, but didn't accept the offer without clearly stating that she had other career aspirations beyond Google. Wessel told CNBC: "I said to the recruiter, 'I definitely love Google, but at the end of the day, I can safely say that Google is a place I want to be for the next two years. After that, I'll probably leave and start a company of my own." Instead of being off-put, the boldness and transparency that Wessel exemplified impressed her recruiter and still earned her the spot. Wessel later went on to co-found WayUp, a job connecting site with ties to company's such as Goldman Sachs and Uber, which reached $1 million in venture capital funding within its first two weeks. Confident in her decision and method of entrepreneurship, Wessel assures: "I always tell people, you know it's time to quit your job when you can't stop thinking about what you want to do next."

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Use Android’s Wi-Fi Assistant to Keep Your Phone Safe on Public Networks If you aren’t using Android’s “Wi-Fi Assistant”, you should. It automatically secures unsafe public wireless networks by using a Google VPN, so attackers can’t access your data. Wi-FI Assistant was originally released with Project Fi, but now it’s available for all Nexus devices running 5.1 and above (in these countries). If your device has it, there’s no reason not to turn it on now. What Is Wi-Fi Assistant? Public networks are inherently insecure. It’s simple for evildoers to use things like packet sniffers to pull your data out of the sky while it’s transmitting—they just need to be connected to the same network as you. Anything that you send can be detected, like passwords or other private information. So that network at the coffee shop isn’t very safe to connect to–unless you have a VPN. RELATED ARTICLE What Is a VPN, and Why Would I Need One? Wi-Fi Assistant is Google’s way of combating this. It’s a service that detects open public Wi-Fi networks, then connects to a VPN (Virtual Private Network) managed by Google, routing all of your traffic through a private, digital tunnel. Since the VPN is encrypted, your data is protected from potential attacks. This way, you can treat many open Wi-Fi networks the same way you could treat your mobile connection or home network—feel free to log in, order things, or do whatever else you want. Your data is as safe as it can be. Of course, it doesn’t work on all public networks, so you need to be able to quickly and easily tell when you’re connected to Google’s VPN. Fortunately, Android already has a way to show that you’re connected to any VPN: a key icon shows up next to the Wi-Fi icon. At one glance, you know that you’re connected and everything is good to go. It’s all very straightforward and simple. How to Set Up Google Wi-Fi Assistant Like I said earlier, Wi-Fi Assistant is only available on Nexus devices running Android 5.1 or higher. It’s also region locked to the US, Canada, Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, and the UK. If both of those requirements are met, read on. Once Wi-Fi Assistant is available on your device, it may notify you once you’re connected to a public network. But you don’t have to wait for it—you can enable it yourself beforehand. First, jump into the Settings menu. Pull the notification shade down a couple of times, then tap the cog icon. From there, scroll down to the “Google” entry. Tap it. Close to the bottom of the list there’s an entry titled “Networking.” That’s what you’re looking for. The Networking menu is short and sweet: there’s a toggle for Wi-Fi Assistant, along with an “Advanced” setting. Go ahead and toggle Wi-Fi Assistant first—we’ll look at the Advanced menu in a moment. Once Wi-Fi Assistant is toggled on, a warning of sorts should pop up, basically telling you what the service does. Read over it if you want, then tap “Got it.” That’s that; Wi-Fi Assistant will do its thing for you from now on. Whenever you’re connected to a network that Google Wi-Fi Assistant wants to secure, a notification will show up. In case you’re curious about the “advanced” section, there’s only one thing in this menu: the option to let Wi-Fi Assistant manage saved networks, so in the future it will automatically connect to networks that you’ve already used. I can think of no reason to turn this feature off, so let’s leave it alone. I mean, you can disable it if you want. It’s your phone, after all. And that’s pretty much that. When Wi-Fi Assistant was first released, it only worked with open networks that it automatically connected to, making is less than useful. Fortunately, Google addressed that issue early on, and now Wi-Fi Assistant will also work with any open network. A notification will show up in the shade asking if you want to let Wi-Fi Assistant do its thing, and you’re off. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (12 REPLIES) October 13, 2016 Francis I have a Nexus 5x and I set up Wifi Assistant when it first became available. Wifi Assistant hasn't auto connected or given me a notification to connect to open networks. I live in a large metro area as well. I use public Wifi every day and still no option to use Google's VPN. Can you elaborate? October 13, 2016 Cameron Summerson Interesting. It doesn't always auto-connect for me, but it does notify me when a compatible network is available. It's my understanding that it doesn't work on all public networks, just "known" ones--like Starbucks and the like. Perhaps you're just not connecting to networks that it knows to secure. October 13, 2016 James H. Keil I have android version 6.0.1, but wifi assistant is not on it. Thanks. October 13, 2016 Whitson Gordon I added a note to the post--it's only available on Nexus devices in these countries, which may be why you aren't seeing it. It's available on Project Fi in a few more countries. October 13, 2016 Francis I have been in every big box store imaginable and Panera Breads, McDonalds,etc,etc, still no VPN auto connect or option to manually connect. I will also try forgetting those networks in my settings and see if that will force the issue since you said there was an update. I will check out Starbucks when I get a chance. Thanks... October 13, 2016 Nayana Sri What is that transparent weather widget thingy? Looking good October 13, 2016 Patrick Mc Auley I have a nexus7 running Android 6.0.1 and I'm in Canada. I see all the other items you show under Settings>Google, but there is no Network item. I've looked at other items under Google and in other parts of Settings, but can't find the Wi-Fi Assistant anywhere. Suggestions? October 13, 2016 Patricia Grace Nexus 5X with Android N.

In 2008, TinEye became the first image search engine to use image identification technology, and in 2010, the Google Goggles app allowed users to search the physical world with their phone cameras. But in the last couple of years, visual search has come into new prominence, with companies like Pinterest and Bing developing into serious contenders in the visual search space, and search engines like Splash conceptualising new ways to search the web visually. We now have an impressive range of visual search methods available to us: we can search with images, with part of an image, with our cameras, with paint on a digital canvas. And combined with applications in ecommerce, and recent advances in augmented reality, visual search is a powerful tool with huge potential. So what can it do currently, and where might it develop in the future? Then and now: The evolution of visual search Although the technology behind image search has come on in leaps and bounds in the past few years, it’s as a result of developments that have taken place over a much longer time period. Image search on the web was around even before the launch of reverse image search engine TinEye in 2008. But TinEye claims that it was the first such search engine to use image identification technology rather than keywords, watermarks or metadata. In 2011, Google introduced its own version of the technology, which allowed users to perform reverse image searches on Google. Both reverse image searches were able to identify famous landmarks, find other versions of the same image elsewhere on the web, and locate ‘visually similar’ images with similar composition of shapes and colour. Neither used facial recognition technology, and TinEye was (and still is) unable to recognise outlines of objects. Google reverse image search in 2011. Source: Search Engine Land Meanwhile, Google Goggles allowed users of Android smartphones (and later in 2010, iPhones and iPads) to identify labels and landmarks in the physical world, as well as identifying product labels and barcodes that would allow users to search online for similar products. This was probably the first iteration of what seems to be a natural marriage between visual search and ecommerce, something I’ll explore a bit more later on. The Google Goggles app is still around on Android, although the technology hasn’t advanced all that much in the last few years (tellingly, it was removed as a feature from Google Mobile for iOS due to being “of no clear use to too many people”), and it tends to pale in comparison to a more modern ‘object search’ app like CamFind. You tried, Goggles. CamFind is a visual search and image recognition mobile app that was launched in 2013, and while it doesn’t appear to be able to solve Sudoku puzzles for you, it does have an impressive rate of accuracy. Back when Google Glass was still a thing, Image Searcher, the startup behind CamFind, developed a version of the app to bring accurate visual search to Google Glass, activated by the command “OK Glass, what do you see?” This is the kind of futuristic application of visual search that many people imagined for a technology like Google Glass, and could have had great potential if Google Glass had caught on. The CamFind mobile app has an impressive accuracy rate, even down to identifying the brand of an object. When the ‘pinboard’-style social network Pinterest launched in 2012, it was a bit of a dark horse, gaining huge popularity with a demographic of young-to-middle-aged women but remaining obscure in most conventional tech circles. Even those who recognised its potential as a social network probably wouldn’t have guessed that it would also shape up into a force to be reckoned with in visual search. But for Pinterest, accurate visual search just makes sense, as it allows Pinterest to serve relevant Pin recommendations to users who might be looking for something visually similar (say, the perfect copper lamp to light their living room) or hone in on the specific part of a Pinned image that interests them. In 2014, Pinterest acquired VisualGraph, a two-person startup which was cofounded by one of Google’s first computer vision engineers, bringing the company’s visual search know-how into the fold. In the same year, it introduced and began refining a function that allowed users to highlight a specific part of a Pin and find other Pins that are visually similar to the highlighted area – two years ahead of Bing, who only introduced that functionality to its mobile image search in July 2016. Bing has pipped Pinterest to the post by introducing visual searching with a smartphone camera to its native iOS app (I can’t comment on how accurate it is, as the Bing iOS app is only available in the US), something that Pinterest is still working on launching. But it’s clear that the two companies are at the vanguard of visual search technology, and it’s worth paying attention to both to see what developments they announce next. Meanwhile, Google is yet to offer any advance on Google Goggles for more accurate searching in the physical world, but you can bet that Google isn’t going to let Pinterest and Bing stay ahead of it for too long. In July, Google announced the acquisition of French startup Moodstocks, which specialises in machine learning-based image recognition technology for smartphones. And at Google I/O in May, Google’s Engineering Director Erik Kay revealed some pretty impressive image recognition capabilities for Google’s new messaging app, Allo. “Allo even offers smart replies when people send photos to you. This works because in addition to understanding text, Allo builds on Google’s computer vision capabilities to understand of the content and the context of images. In this case, Allo understood that the picture was of a dog, that it was a cute dog, and even the breed of the dog. In our internal testing, we found that Allo is 90% accurate in determining whether a dog deserves the ”cute dog” response.” Visual search and ecommerce: A natural partnership How many times have you been out and about and wished you could find out where that person bought their cool shoes, or their awesome bag, without the awkwardness of having to approach a stranger and ask? What if you could just use your phone camera to secretly take a snap (though that’s still potentially quite awkward if you get caught, let’s be honest) and shop for visually similar search results online? Ecommerce is a natural application for visual search, something which almost all companies behind visual search have realised, and made an integral part of their offering. CamFind, for example, will take you straight to shopping results for any object that you search, creating a seamless link between seeing an item and being able to buy it (or something like it) online. Pinterest’s advances in visual search also serve the ecommerce side of the platform, by helping users to isolate products that they might be interested in and smoothly browse similar items. An ‘object search’ function for its mobile app would also be designed to help people find items similar to ones they like in the physical world on Pinterest, with a view to buying them. With the myriad possibilities that visual search holds for ecommerce, it’s no surprise that Amazon has also thrown its hat into the ring. In 2014, it integrated a shopping-by-camera functionality into its main iOS app (and has since released the function on Android), and also launched Firefly, a visual recognition and search app for the Amazon Fire Phone. Even after the Fire Phone flopped, Amazon refused to give up on Firefly, and introduced the app to the more affordable Kindle Fire HD. The visual search function on its mobile app works best with books, DVDs and recognisably branded objects, but it otherwise has a good rate of accuracy. Amazon’s visual search in action. Other companies operating in the cross-section of visual search and ecommerce which have emerged in the past few years include Slyce, whose slogan is “Give your customer’s camera a buy button”, and Catchoom, which creates image recognition and augmented reality tools for retail, publishing and other sectors. Although searching the physical world has yet to cross over into the mainstream (most people I’ve talked to about it aren’t even aware that the technology exists), that could easily change as the technology becomes more accurate and increasingly widespread. But ecommerce is only one possible application for visual search. What other uses and innovations could we see spring up around visual search in the future?

Aside from the fairly obvious prediction that visual search will become more accurate and more widespread as time goes on, I can imagine various possibilities for visual search going forward, some of which already exist on a small scale. The visual recognition technology which powers visual search has huge potential to serve as an accessibility aid. Image Searcher, the company behind CamFind, also has an app called TapTapSee which uses visual recognition and voiceover technology to identify objects for visually impaired and blind mobile users. Another app, Talking Goggles, performs the same function using Google Goggles’ object identification technology. Although these are purely recognition apps and not search engines as such, Image Searcher have used a great deal of the feedback they receive from the visually impaired community to integrate the same features into CamFind. It’s easy to imagine how the two concepts, if developed in tandem, could be used to provide a truly accessible visual search to visually impaired users in the future. And if camera-based visual search were combined with recent advances in voice search and natural language processing, it’s possible to imagine a future in which the act of searching visually becomes virtually interface-free. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, demonstrated a very similar capability at Google I/O when he showed off Google’s new voice assistant, Google Assistant. “For example, you can be in front of this structure in Chicago and ask Google, ”Who designed this?” You don’t need to say ”the bean” or ”the cloud gate.” We understand your context and we answer that the designer is Anish Kapoor.” In this example, the unstated context for Pichai’s question “Who designed this?” is likely provided by location data, but it could just as easily be visual input, provided by a smartphone camera or an improved Google Glass-like device. I mentioned something called Splash earlier on in this article. Splash, a search interface developed by photo community 500px, is a different type of visual search than any we’ve looked at so far. The interface is designed to allow users to visually search 500px’s image library using colour, digitally ‘splashing’ the paint onto a canvas. As far as visual search engines go, Splash is more of a fun novelty than a practical search tool. You can only search for images in one of five categories – Landscape, People, Animals, Travel and City – so if you want a picture of something that doesn’t come under one of those, good luck to you. The search results also tend to respond more to which colours are on the canvas than to what you’re trying to depict with it. Not really what I was after… Even so, I like the different take that Splash gives on searching visually, and I think that the idea has a lot of interesting potential if it were developed and refined more. Other types of visual search that we’ve talked about so far depend on having a picture or an object to hand, but what if you wanted to search for something you knew how to draw, but didn’t have an example of to hand? Another thing I would find incredibly useful in my work as a journalist (where I’m often called upon to source stock images) would be the ability to search for a visual concept. Say I’m looking for a picture to represent ‘email ROI’ for a piece I’m writing. It would be really helpful if I could run a visual search for any images which combined visuals relating to email, and visuals relating to money, in some way. Maybe a keyword-based search could get close to what I need, but I think a visual search would be able to cast a wider, and more useful, net. Finally, if developing visual search continues to be a priority for companies like Pinterest, Bing and Google, I think the most natural evolution of the technology would be to incorporate augmented reality. AR is already advancing into the mainstream – not just with Pokémon Go, but apps like Blippar which fuse AR with visual discovery and visual search to add an extra dimension to the world around us. There’s clear potential for this to become a fully-fledged search phenomenon, say with text overlays providing information about objects you want to search for, and the ability to interact with items and purchase them, removing even more friction from ecommerce and enabling users to buy things in the moment of inspiration. I don’t foresee visual search replacing the text-based variety altogether (or at least, not for a very long time). But does opens up a world of exciting new possibilities that will play a big part in whatever’s to come for search in the future.

The code name is “Project Titan.” Apple brings back Bob Mansfield from retirement to lead the project. Apple lays off dozens of employees who were presumably working on the car project that was never confirmed. Apple might no longer be making a car. There! You are all caught up on the months of speculation around Apple and cars! What I do know for sure is Apple is in my car today. A new car I have had now for about 10 days. A totally unnecessary purchase justified by the fact that my old car – a 2014 Suburban – was not technologically savvy enough. Now, I have the 2016 model and it does all sorts of things for me — warning me about lane departures, making my seat vibrate when a car or pedestrian is approaching me while reversing, and showing me the direction with a big red arrow on my screen. The most interesting part, however, is having CarPlay and Android Auto. As I am currently using an iPhone 7 Plus, I tried out CarPlay and the results are quite interesting. I have been using Google Maps pretty much since I got to the US four years ago. My old car had a navigation system but I hated it so I was using my phone with a Bluetooth connection. I had tried Apple Maps when it first came out but went back to Google and soon got used to certain features, such as the multi-lane turn as well as the exact timing of the command. I got comfortable with it and, aside from trying out HereWeGo and Waze, I have been pretty much happy with Google. Having CarPlay made me rediscover Maps and features like where I parked my car, the suggested travel time to home or school or the office, suggestions based on routine or calendar information — all pleasant surprises that showed me what I had been missing out. It also showed me how, by fully embracing the ecosystem, you receive greater benefits. Having the direction clearly displayed on the large car screen was better and, while there is still a little bit of uneasiness about not using Google Maps, I have now switched over. Maps on Apple Watch just completes the car experience as the device gently taps you as you need to make the turn. It is probably the best example I have seen thus far of devices working together to deliver an enhanced experience vs. one device taking over the other. Music has been in my car thanks to a subscription to Sirius XM but, at home, we also have an Apple Music subscription as well as Amazon Prime Music. With CarPlay, my music starts to play in the car as soon as the phone is connected and, despite my husband’s initial resistance, this past weekend, he was converted. He asked Siri to play Rancid and he was somewhat surprised when one of his favorite songs came on. My daughter is also happily making requests to Siri and everybody catching a ride is quite relieved not to be subjected to Kidz Bop Radio non-stop. The best feature, however, is having Siri read and compose text messages for you. I know I can do that outside my car as well but I rarely do, because, well frankly, I don’t have to: typing serves me just fine. When I interact with Siri, the exchange feels very transactional, i ask a question I get an answer and that is it. The car is the perfect storm when it comes to getting you hooked on voice commands. You are not supposed to be texting and driving, the space is confined, and there is little background noise as the music is turned off when you speak (I have to admit a switch to turn off the kids would be nice too). Siri (she) gets commands and messages right 90% of the time which gets me to use her more. Interestingly, it is also the time where I have a more natural, more conversational, exchange with Siri: Siri: There is a new message from XYZ would you like me to read it to you? Me: Yes, please. Siri: (reads message) Siri: Would you like to respond Me: Yes Siri: Go ahead Me: Yada Yada Yada Siri: You are replying Yada Yada Yada, ready to send? Me: Yes At the end, you have a pretty satisfied feeling of having achieved what you wanted and not once moving your eyes from the road ahead. Our Voice Assistant survey did show a preference for consumers to use their voice assistant in the car. Fifty-one percent of the US consumers we interviewed said they do, so I am clearly not alone. I would argue that interacting through car speakers vs the phone – assuming you are not holding the phone to your mouth which would not be hands-free – gives you higher fidelity and therefore a better, more engaging experience. While we wait for autonomous cars (maybe even one by Apple) to take over and leave us free to either work or play while we go from point A and B, it is understandable that CarPlay stays limited to functions that complement your driving but do not interfere with your concentration. That said, I think there is a lot of room for Apple to deliver a smarter experience in the car if it accesses more information from the car and the user. Suggesting a gas station when the gas indicator goes below a certain point, suggesting a place to park when we get to our destination, or a restaurant if we are driving somewhere where we have not been before and are close to lunch time. The possibilities are many. The problem with CarPlay is it relies on consumers upgrading their cars to one of the over 100 models available or integrating CarPlay kits — which range from just under $200 to over $700 depending on brand and quality. This is a steep price to pay when you are not quite sure what the return on your investment will be. Apple needs to find a way to lower that adoption barrier for CarPlay so as to speed up adoption. The more users experience CarPlay, the easier it will be to get them to take the next step when it comes to cars, whether an Apple-branded car or a fuller Apple experience in the car.

See all articles by Carolina Milanesi @caro_milanesi Unpacked for Friday November 11, 2016 Has Google Set Up Google Home to Disappoint? Touchscreen or No Touchscreen, That is the Question! More from Carolina Milanesi tedcranmore I am loving CarPlay myself. The biggest surprise for me was when it turned down the fan that was running full blast to hear me speak better, and then turned it back full when my speaking was done. It’s an interesting balance of providing service by voice and not showing it on the screen, which I would get to see if I dash mounted my phone. Overall, I’d suggest more tech fans should rationalize a new car purchase just to get CarPlay (despite how ridiculous that sounds)! aardman “Apple needs to find a way to lower that adoption barrier for CarPlay so as to speed up adoption.” I suspect this is a tall order if you want a seamlessly integrated system. And if it was at all possible without comprising on the user experience, Apple would have done it already. carolina milanesi I would think it might require a different business model. If vendors need to lower the hardware prices than something has to give David Gregory First of all Ms Milanesi, your Suburban is a Truck Based SUV- not a car. Just like my Trek Bike is not a motorcycle. CarPlay has some serious issues starting with the lack of third party apps. One of the few Tune-In Radio (+the Pro version) seemingly breaks every time Apple releases an update to iOS. Few iOS app developers have made the jump to CarPlay, the big question being what is holding up progress? I would love to see Apple allow map plugins for CarPlay that would overlay live weather radar data on the Apple Maps display for those who must drive in nasty weather. I have an iOS App that allows subscription based live Radar data that would be a great help if it could get on CarPlay. Apple Maps is still pretty lame on Navigation and on location based recommendations. A new Bridge on a US Highway that I regularly drive and has been open for months is still not on CarPlay’s navigation. The ability of Apple Maps to recommend based upon local recent activity is polluted by it’s aggressive seeking of data in your emails. The routing is not very good compared to Google even after all this time. I can be a mile from a YMCA I go to 5 times a week but if I do a Siri search for YMCA I get seemingly random results from cities far away. Another Siri gripe is that the car’s built in voice recognition is more accurate than Siri even though they both use the same microphones in the same car with the same driver. Apple has some homework to do. The ability to play tunes content has been ruined by Apple’s push of it’s rental music service that I have no interest in. Apple needs to fix iTunes, iOS Music and the way the content is handled on CarPlay. As to price, not all manufacturers charge for CarPlay. Volkswagen gives it away on their standard radio and I am sure they are not alone. I really want CarPlay to work well as both a long time Apple customer and shareholder. CarPlay holds a lot of promise but seems to suffer from the same neglect as the Macintosh. Apple has more than enough money and staff to walk and chew gum at the same time, so the glacial pace of improvement of CarPlay and HomeKit is unacceptable. Bill Tanner My early experience was similar to yours although I have a 3rd party unit so it felt slightly less magical (no automatic quieting of fans for example). The barrier to entry is actually higher than you note for 3rd party solutions as the price of a CarPlay capable head unit is only part of the cost. Mine cost $600 at retail but installation+wiring harnesses+dash kit+sales tax brought the out-the-door cost to about $1100. You could buy it cheaper on Amazon and install it yourself but pulling car dashes apart and mucking around with car electrical systems isn’t something that 99% of car owners are going to do. Another MIA piece is wireless. There was a lot of buzz about it back when CarPlay was announced but it has never showed up. Plugging and unplugging the cable gets old if you make a lot of short trips. A CarPlay capable unit might have Bluetooth but CarPlay doesn’t use it. As mentioned, 3rd party app support is weak. Perhaps because of Apple limits on the kind of apps that can be supported or perhaps because developers don’t see the value. Even some popular podcast apps don’t support it and listening to podcasts in a car is obvious and popular. I love CarPlay but the missing pieces are both frustrating and puzzling. carolina milanesi there is certainly more work to be done but i thought it was interesting as an early view of what an end to end experience could look like Bill Tanner Like HomeKit, CarPlay is interesting and promising. The challenge is that Apple’s pace of improvement is glacial as they seem to to tie improvements in all their software products to the annual OS update cycle with only occasional exceptions. HomeKit is going to take 5 more years at this rate to have the basic functionality that products like Samsung SmartThings have today. Software applications continue to be Apple’s weak point. They treat it like hardware where you launch it but do nothing more with it except critical fixes until the next big launch. It’s absurd that we only see new versions of apps as part of OS updates. PhilipGBaker I have CarPlay on a 2017 Chevy Volt, and it’s best use is to play podcasts and iHeart radio stations. But the car has such an excellent navigation system built in, that using Apple Maps is a disappointment. Much less detail, hard to read and low contrast. And the first time I used it by searching for a known restaurant, it came up with the wrong address. The phone function is adequate, but not as good as the one built in that has a much more informative displayed. Unfortunately, when you enable CarPlay by plugging in the phone, it turns off BT, not letting you use the car’s phone software. carolina milanesi how long ago did you use Maps? I am curious as I made up my mind very early that it was not for me and I was surprised how far Apple has come. Not quite on par with Google but way way better than it used to be. Also surprised you like the on car navigation i hated mine with passion from the voice to the timing of the directions but all of that is very personal of course PhilipGBaker The GM Volt Nav system is so much better than anything else I have tried, including BMW, Lexus, Toyota and Mazda. A real surpise. Very high resolution and contrast. Switching to CarPlay replaced the maps with a less detailed, lower rez and harder to read map. Apple Maps have improved, but I was startled to find the address of a restaurant that’s been in the same location for 15 years to be placed at the same street number, but on a nearby street in a nearby town. I used the built in report tool to send the corrected address to Apple and a few days later it showed the correct street address, but in another nearby town. petieg Wireless CarPlay is coming!!

Reuters/John Javellana Iconic American men’s magazine Playboy announced Wednesday that it would be available digitally for the first time on Apple and Google platforms in an attempt to reach out to millennials. The digital publication shall be nude-free, as it has been since earlier this year. Starting March, the long-running magazine earlier gave up on frontal nudity to increase subscribers. Now it’s pushing boundaries even further as it launched on Google Play and iTunes. David Israel, chief operating officer and chief financial officer of Playboy Enterprises, confirmed the move to feature “safer” content paid off. “Since introducing a brand new vision for Playboy magazine earlier this year, we have expanded our distribution channels in many powerful ways, including higher visibility on an increased number of traditional and digital media platforms,” he said. “Inclusion in the iTunes and Google Play stores is an important milestone for Playboy as we continue to explore opportunities to introduce our content to new audiences all over the world.” Playboy shocked the world in 1953 when its first issue featuring a nude Marilyn Monroe centrefold was released. In a move to break away from other pornographic peers, Playboy switched gears and focused on more wholesome subject matters, resulting in increased social media trade and exposure. While Playboy has not given up plastering images of scantily clad women, the new direction its taking is a big contrast to what people are used to seeing in its pages: nudity. Playboy revamped its website to wipe out all traces of nudity. The new site debuted in August 2014 and within four months, the unique monthly visitors increased significantly, going from 4 million to 20 million as reported by Quartz. A single digital issue of Playboy is priced at US$5.99 (AU$7.93). The annual subscription fee is US$17.99 (AU$23.81). This is not the first time the company has ventured into the app world though. Playboy Now, its site’s app extension, and Playboy Classic, a source of vintage content, have both been previously launched.

Pixel Phones Bought from Verizon and Google to Get Updates Simultaneously GO OS updates and security patches will arrive at the same time Oct 13, 2016 12:26 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google released its latest smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, last week and has made them available through Verizon, which will be the only US carrier to offer them to customers. After the launch, many have worried that updates to the two smartphones will arrive later at the US carrier. However, in a recent statement for Ars Technica, Verizon has said that all operating system and security updates for Pixel smartphones will be managed in partnership with Google. This means that Verizon phones will receive the same updates at the same time as Pixel phones bought directly from Google. Moreover, Google has confirmed that the smartphones sold by Verizon will receive updates at the same time as those sold via its Store. Pixel and Pixel XL are currently available for pre-order at Verizon, and the US carrier is offering customers a free Daydream View VR headset to pair with their new handset. The two smartphones are offered in three color variants, white, black or blue. Pixel smartphones will be compatible with Verizon HD Voice and Wi-Fi calling In addition, Pixel phones bought from the Google Store will be compatible with Verizon HD Voice and Wi-Fi calling. Verizon is also said to be locking down the bootloader of Pixel smartphones sold through its stores and website. This means that users won’t be able to experiment with hardware on the phones, by rooting or flashing custom software. The two smartphones are expected to arrive in stores on October 20 and Google has already spent millions on marketing the two devices. In addition, the tech giant has released new ads for promoting Pixel and Pixel XL phones. Google is expected to sell up to 4 million Pixel phones this year, although the number might increase considering that the company will look to take over some of the market share that Samsung has just lost with the announcement of a second Galaxy Note 7 recall.

Comments Computerworld | Oct 13, 2016 3:50 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Networking Internet Google Facebook Comments It's not everyday that you hear about Google and Facebook teaming up. But that is exactly what they are doing. The two companies announced they have invested in a trans-Pacific submarine fiber optic cable that will be among the fastest ever built. So what are the details? In IT Blogwatch, we have a need for speed.  So what is going on? Chris Preimesberger has the background: Google and Facebook...are working together to lay a nearly 8,000-mile cable between Los Angeles and Hong Kong that is scheduled to go into service in 2018...the new Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) will have...an estimated cable bandwidth of 120 terabits per second...double the speed of the current highest-capacity trans-Pacific route, a record currently held by another Google-backed cable system, FASTER. Sounds fast, but what exactly does that mean? Stephanie Condon breaks it down for us: The Silicon Valley giants are teaming up with undersea communications company TE Subcom and...Pacific Light Data Communication...to build the...PLCN. It will have...enough capacity for Hong Kong to have 80 million concurrent HD video conference calls with LA. Once completed, PLCN will be the highest-capacity trans-Pacific route. ... TE Subcom noted...the system includes its C+L technology, which effectively doubles the available bandwidth and capacity per fiber pair over a traditional C-band-only designed system. And why is there a need for these undersea cables? Agence France-Presse explains it all: Lifestyles increasingly centered on access to cloud-based online services as well as to video, pictures and other content...have increased the need for infrastructure capable of quickly and efficiently moving digital data. ... PLCN will be the sixth submarine cable in which Google has an ownership stake...[and] Microsoft and Facebook early this year teamed together to lay a high-speed internet cable across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. If Google already has five other undersea cables, why does it need another? Brian Quigley, director of Google networking infrastructure adds some context: Google’s mission is to connect people to...information by providing fast and reliable infrastructure. From data centers to cables under the sea, we’re dedicated to building infrastructure that reaches more people than ever before. ... From the get-go, PLCN is designed to accommodate evolving infrastructure technology, allowing us to independently choose network equipment and refresh optical technology as it advances...PLCN will bring lower latency, more security and greater bandwidth to...users in the APAC region...PLCN expands our ability to serve people in Asia, including Google Cloud and G Suite customers. Anything else important? IT support company Yellowbus Solutions Ltd isn't intimidated: So we don't quite offer 120Tbps but we're hoping you don't need 80 million consecutive HD Video conference calls!

Phoebe Luckhurst names and shames the trolling tribes Phoebe Luckhurst Thursday 13 October 2016 11:29 BST The dark web Paul Dallimore In theory, Twitter is a marvellous idea. It is a space for sharing news and opinions, for public- service announcements and quick quips that are more illuminating than they seem. Accordingly, it is noisily influential: at the last quarter’s count, it was estimated that the micro-blogging site has more than  313 million users worldwide.  But this cacophony and its reach has peaked at a moment when the tenor of public discourse has become charged with hatred. Leave and Remain are still hurling mud months after the referendum result; meanwhile, the Labour party, which is consuming itself at a rapacious rate, is failing to address the internal misogyny and anti-Semitism that is manifest particularly on Twitter.  Outside party politics, female MPs including Maria Miller and Stella Creasy have spoken about the importance of addressing online harassment, specifically of women. The alt-Right continues its hostile march: notably, in July, the movement’s pin-up, writer and speaker Milo Yiannopoulos, was removed from the site permanently after targeting Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones with racist, misogynist abuse.  And then, of course, there is Donald Trump and his attendant chorus. Trump’s tweets are by turns unpleasant and incendiary but he also animates others. When Trump was lampooned for his “locker room” misogyny, angry women were answered by misogynists defending their messiah.  Read more Twitter tunes into SoundCloud sale How can we be certain it’s a problem? The prescient satirist Charlie Brooker takes Twitter storms as the topic of an episode in the upcoming series of Black Mirror. There is a bile-spewing columnist whom people are wishing dead — and then she dies. It escalates: soon  someone at the centre of a  tweetstorm, with the hashtag #deathto[insertname], gets killed. It should sound more fantastical than it does.  Twitter’s 50 shades of hate has market implications. Recently it has been rumoured that the site is planning to sell: interested suitors reportedly included Disney, Google and Salesforce, and the company was said to have appointed Goldman Sachs to manage the sale. However, suddenly all is quiet. This week, Twitter shares fell sharply and its CEO,  Jack Dorsey — who rejoined the company last year, promising to address the site’s hate-speech problem — is now wearing a rictus grin and being evasive about plans to sell.  In May, sites including Twitter and Google signed an online code of conduct that committed them to confronting hate speech. “We remain committed to letting the tweets flow,” said Karen White, Twitter’s head of public policy in Europe. “However, there is a clear distinction between freedom of expression and conduct that incites violence and hate.” “It’s become a place for trolls, for hate speech,” says Jennifer Saba, a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. “Advertisers don’t want to be associated with that. They don’t want to be around a brand that is that controversial.” She observes that capital isn’t the issue: Google, for example, could easily afford the site. “But it has fallen out of favour with Silicon Valley.” Granted, this is not just Twitter’s problem. This week the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) committed itself to tackling online hate speech. But undeniably, there is something about the frenzy of Twitter that enables this unpleasant racket. And these hate tribes will be difficult to silence: this is what we are up against.  1. Student snowflakes  What: Once upon a time, students were free radicals, questioning and outward-looking. Then they were lobotomised en masse and decided to reject the purest purpose of university — namely, exposure to testing ideas — and instead issued blanket bans on people with whom they didn’t agree. Suddenly they were arguing that entire sections of certain courses were triggering and therefore literally should not be taught, even though part of the point of studying history is the acknowledgement of its mistakes so that we do not repeat them. They use Twitter to rally their movement. The irony that they are acting a little like the despots they claim to be so disturbed by is entirely lost on them.  Notable moments: Last week, King’s College London’s welfare officer called for the national anthem to be withdrawn from the graduation ceremony for promoting “far-Right nationalism”. If only far-Right nationalism were as benign as that plodding song.  How to rile them: Start a club night called “unsafe space”.   Lily Allen has been taking on Twitter trolls (Rex) 2. The withering Right-wing intelligentsia What: The snowflake students find their natural enemy in the Right-wing intelligentsia: often arch, waspish columnists from publications with a Conservative bent, or fighty figures such as Louise Mensch. The more their young opponent tangles himself in knots, like a toddler throwing a tantrum, the shorter and more arch their responses become. Their worldview is anathema to that of the safe space.  Notable moments: Coining the phrase “Stepford students”.   How to rile them: Tell them their offspring is running for NUS president.  The best apps for Londoners 12 show all The best apps for Londoners 1/12 Zip car ‘Join, reserve, unlock and drive’ — it really is that simple. The capital’s preferred car club’s app gives 24/7 access to cars and vans in your neighbourhood and lets you extend or cancel reservations on the go. Free 2/12 Uncover Still on the waiting list for Chiltern Firehouse? You need Uncover, which redistributes cancelled reservations at some of the capital’s top restaurants, including The River Café and Nobu. Not for planning freaks, though — tables typically become free at 40 minutes’ notice. Free 3/12 Uber So popular it’s become a verb, this private driver service has revolutionised travel in the capital. It’s speedy and affordable, making it a welcome alternative to the night bus. Free 4/12 Santander Cycles Launched this summer, the official app for Boris’ fifth child can be used to search for nearby docking stations and check bike availability. There’s also a journey planner featuring easy, moderate and fast routes to satisfy all cycling tribes. Free 5/12 Plume Air Report This new app has been downloaded by 3,000 Londoners. Sensors gathering air pollution data submit updates every hour, resulting in a scale that ranges from ‘fresh’ to ‘extremely polluted’. Free 6/12 Nightcapp Here’s an app that will have booze hounds raising their glasses. NightCapp is a map that pinpoints more than 1,500 London watering holes that stay open past 11.30pm. It also shows users when a bar is about to close by highlighting it in orange. Better get moving. Free 7/12 Money Dashboard An award-winning budget planner, this helps you keep track of personal spending across multiple accounts, pay off credit cards and even makes suggestions on how to manage your finances better. Free 8/12 Her Promising to introduce women to ‘a lesbian that hasn’t slept with any of your friends’, this revamped dating app includes queer-themed news and blogs, upcoming event notices and an improved algorithm-matching system. Free 9/12 FoodMood This new startup, which reckons it’s ‘Tinder for food’, pledges to narrow down your choice of lunchbreak destinations. Hit ‘yum’ or ‘yuk’ on photos of dishes in your area. Juvenile, but strangely addictive. Free 10/12 Daily Yoga This offers more than 50 yoga sessions, as well as a database of 500 yoga poses. Suitable for all levels, programmes include yoga aimed at specific areas of the body and weight loss. Namaste to that. Free 11/12 Coffee Meets Bagel Billed as the ‘anti-Tinder’, this new kid on the block delivers just a single match to users once a day. Coffee Meets Bagel uses Facebook profile information to recommend suitors based on friends of friends. Neither coffee nor bagels are included. Free. 12/12 Bristlr Do you have a beard? Perhaps you’d like to stroke one on a regular basis? This can be arranged. Unlike other dating apps, Bristlr is unashamedly all about hooking up the hairy with the hairless. There’s even a beard-rating option for aficionados. Free 3. The tween vigilantes What: Perhaps the most frightening of all the denominations online. This group of technologically agile teenagers follows its icons with the irrationality of the zealot and will spear critics with figurative pitchforks. Any slight can animate them. Sub-groups include the Directioners (the tweens who are fanatical about One Direction), the Zayniacs (Zayn Malik) and the Beyhive, Beyoncé’s fans. These kids have the advantage of having no full-time jobs and an innate understanding of technology.  Notable moments: Last year, one journalist tweeted a picture of Cheryl Cole in what looked like a compromising situation; she was shellshocked by the vitriol levelled at her by Cheryl’s “soldiers”. “You are gonna be ruined by the time we’ve all finished with you. You awful human being. You’ve got what’s coming to you,” said one. “You f***ed with the wrong fanbase,” said another.  How to rile them: Tell them their favourite member of 1D is getting married.  4. The Momentum deselectors  Read more Sick online trolls target Kim Kardashian with cruel jibes after robbery ordeal YouTube star Niomi Smart speaks out after facing abuse from online trolls Tom Watson 'trolls Jeremy Corbyn with tweet about traingate row' What: Momentum — nicknamed Mob-mentum by critics — is the fifth column inside the Labour Party that has a pro-Corbyn manifesto of varying levels of radicalism. On the side, its activists pursue an online agenda that seemingly includes calling for the deselection of Labour MPs whom it considers to be traitors. It all sounds a bit Dolores Umbridge and the Inquisitorial Squad; it is, in fact, targeted bullying, though the organisation has insisted that these members are rogue, not acting from a directive from on high.  Notable moments: After the BBC Panorama documentary on the group there was out-and-out warfare.  How to rile them: Come out in favour of parliamentary democracy.  5. The anti-Semites What: Linked inextricably to the growth of the hard-line anti-Zionism stance on the far Left,  Twitter has a seeping anti-Semitism crisis. Earlier this year, some Jewish users of the site changed their handle to include three brackets around their name, to express solidarity with those who had been targeted.  Notable moments: In July, decorated New York Times journalist Jon Weisman quit Twitter after experiencing a series of anti-Semitic attacks. His departure was a turning point. He has returned — warily — to the network.  How to rile them: Please, don’t even engage.  6. Nice-guy misogynists What: The mantra of the “nice-guy misosgynist” is best explained using a Facebook status that went viral on Reddit. It reads simply: “Wish I had a gf… god I hate women :(”. The stupid phrase invokes perfectly the “nice-guy complex”: these men think women owe them something because they haven’t tried to rape said women. Women who turn them down for a date are “whores”, women offended by cat-calling are “ugly sluts”. They will end most back-handedly misogynist tweets with the expression “haha”.  Notable moments: Any time they talk about the friend zone. How to rile them: Tell them they’re in the friend zone. Victim of trolling: J K Rowling (Getty) 7. The men’s rights activists (MRAs) What: The men’s rights activists are a distinct group of men who truly believe that the objective of feminism is to destroy men. They are incensed by it: one MRA Twitter account recently compared it to fascism (“feminists are okay with feminism just as Nazis are okay with Nazism”). This group intersects neatly with much of Trump’s army and members of the alt-Right movement. Your average MRA thinks sexism is fantasy, and that women cannot run companies because they might get their period and crash the stock market. They are furiously baffled by issues including equal pay and maternity leave.  Notable moments: Every International Women’s Day, when MRAs are apoplectic with rage about the absence of an equivalent day for men (“TELL ME WHY THERE IS NO DAY TO HIGHLIGHT THE ISSUES MEN FACE EVERY DAY #everydaysexism #feminazis #prejudice”). How to rile them: Be a woman.  8. The alt-Right What: The ultra-conservative movement is messy and untrammelled: pulling in misogyny, religion, Trump supporters, nice guys and MRAs and conspiracy theorists. They are typically white men. Clearly, it is competitive, but they are probably the most furious people on the internet — this week, they spent hours arguing with a fake bot set up by American activist Sarah Nyberg. They rant and rave and attack and crow at those who have been “doxxed” (had their personal details published on the internet).  They “dog-pile” — virtually leap on users and attack them — and whip up virtual mobs. They hate liberal ideas and political correctness, and they hate anyone dissenting from or criticising their idols, namely Yiannopoulos. Reading material includes the news site Breitbart, which The Week calls “the unofficial media hub for the alt-Right”. Yiannopoulos used to work there.  Notable moments: The #freeMilo hashtag, in the aftermath of his banning from the site.  How to rile them: Exist. 9. The racists  What: One particularly unpleasant outcome of the Brexit fallout is the normalisation of racist speech. Racism has always existed in inky corners of the internet but the current public discourse — pitched against migrants — has accelerated the pace of the language online. Today, the scale of hate crime since Brexit will be revealed in official figures; it is feared there has been a rise in Islamophobia and attacks on foreigners. Last week it was revealed that some commentators are using the names of technology companies, including Google and Skype, as a racist code to refer to specific minorities. These people are, obviously, vile and defy any rational explanation.  Notable moments: The trolling of Leslie Jones, the Ghostbusters actress and comedian, caused Jack Dorsey to — finally — intervene and ban Milo Yiannopoulos from Twitter. How to rile them: Please, don’t even engage.  Unreleased Brexit posters 11 show all Unreleased Brexit posters 1/11 The grenade is used to show jobs, families and the economy could be at risk because of a Leave vote M&C Saatchi 2/11 A pregnant woman was used to illustrate voters should think of the next generation when casting their ballot M&C Saatchi 3/11 The campaign focused on how young people wanted to remain part of the EU M&C Saatchi 4/11 Remain supporters used Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Gove, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson in images to dissuade voters M&C Saatchi 5/11 This poster aims to convey the message Britain's influence in the world would weaken as a result of Brexit M&C Saatchi 6/11 M&C Saatchi 7/11 Young people overwhelming voted in favour of Remain M&C Saatchi 8/11 This poster draws on the campaign message from Leave and casts aspersions on its claims M&C Saatchi 9/11 The poster infers the uncertainty behind a Leave vote is akin to falling from a cliff M&C Saatchi 10/11 The grenade is used to illustrate the possible explosive consequences of a Leave vote M&C Saatchi 11/11 Remain supporters argued Britain should take a leading role in shaping the EU M&C Saatchi AND THE GOODIES... 10. The straight-backers  What: Straight-backers take on the haters; accordingly, they bear the most violent brunt of the hate speech. Traditionally, straight-backers became entrenched in meandering, frustrating back-and-forths with irrational trolls, bile filling their mentions. But the new straight-backer knows there’s a better way: shutting abusers down by quoting their tweet, appended with their juicy last word. It is the verbal version of the nail-varnish emoji — in other words, sass distilled — and is also very retweetable by their sensible army of disciples. Notable members of the tribe include singer Lily Allen and author J K Rowling.  Notable moments: The time Rowling retorted to an officious twentysomething calling Corbyn the “Dumbledore of our generation” with, “I forgot Dumbledore trashed Hogwarts, refused to resign and ran off to the forest to make speeches to angry trolls”.Yesterday, Allen was loudly answering those who oppose a humane solution to the migrant crisis and cannily retweeted the most vituperative critics (“used to be a huge fan before i knew you were a leftist racist traitor to your country and kinsmen. F*ck you very, very much”). She’s not scared. How to rile them: Prejudice.  @phoebeluckhurst More about: Twitter Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

If you are, you might be interested to learn that Google has recently updated the app with four new features, features that might come in handy especially if you are a pretty heavy Google Photos user or if you are particularly reliant on the service, or even if you browse the service every now and then. According to Google, “Today we’re bringing you four new features for Google Photos — three new ways for you to relive and the share moments that matter, and a quick way to fix some of those pesky sideways photos in your collection.” The first feature seems to have to do with rediscovering old photos, where Google Photos will try to search older photos that contain the same people in your more recent snaps. The second feature is aimed at users who take a ton of photos and are trying to look for the best one, or at least the one that’s determined to be the best by Google’s algorithm. The third feature is animation. Google Photos can animate various photos and can even create videos, but this feature animates videos, or to be more specific, portions of a video that contain some kind of activity so that you can share that particular scene without having to share the entire video. Last but not least, we reckon this feature is probably the most useful in which Google will try to find photos that are sideways and make them the right way. If you have a ton of photos in your archive that need some “righting”, this feature should save you a ton of time. These new features should already be live across all the platforms that Google Photos is available on. Filed in General. Read more about Apps, Google and google photos.

The launch of Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL, first smartphones to be made by Google inside and out, marks the first step of the company's journey towards this shift. Speaking about the transition, Google made it quite clear at the launch event that its AI-based chatbot, the Google Assistant will be exclusive to Pixel phones and has no intentions to provide access to it on the non-Pixel smartphones (at least for now, things may change in the future).

Lifestyle Tech News PlayStation VR release date: Sony releases virtual reality kit and looks to bring headsets to the mainstream PS VR costs considerably less than rival technologies, and is perhaps the first time that people will be able to try out proper virtual reality gaming Andrew Griffin @_andrew_griffin Thursday 13 October 2016 11:14 BST An elated customer at the launch of PlayStation VR at the GAME Digital Westfield White City midnight launch. GAME Digital PlayStations are no longer things that sit underneath your TV. Now they get strapped to your face. Sony has released the PlayStation VR, a special headset that represents its first foray into virtual reality gaming. And it might represent many other people’s first try with it, too, since it is much cheaper than competing headsets and doesn’t require a huge computer system. The PS VR plugs into existing PlayStation 4 consoles with a series of wires.

PlayStation VR is cheaper than those competitors on its own, costing just £349 when compared to £549 for the Rift and £749 for the Vive. Several big PlayStation games are already working on virtual reality versions. That includes Star Wars Battlefront, which will soon include a level built for virtual reality, and the horror game Resident Evil. But while PS VR is much cheaper than other traditional VR headsets, it’s far more expensive than those that use mobiles as their screen. Samsung makes a Gear VR that costs just £100 and allows people to slide their phone in, for instance, and Google is about to release a Daydream VR headset that will cost even less.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Comments By Ryan Whitwam Follow Greenbot | Oct 13, 2016 4:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Android Google Pixel Nexus Comments It seems Google would like people to think the Pixel is the first phone it has ever produced with its “Made by Google” ad campaign. The most devoted fans of the Android platform have never seen it that way. To them, the Nexus phones were about “pure Android,” but now they’re suddenly finding their phones have been demoted. Google has said there will be no new Nexus phones, and what's more, the Pixel and Pixel XL will get exclusive features that aren’t coming to the current Nexus line, and Nexus owners are understandably upset. How upset? Well, we cannot reprint some of what’s been said, if that gives you an idea. Sticker shock The response to Google’s Pixel announcement among Nexus fans came in two waves—first came the price shock, then the feature shock. When the phones were announced, everyone was dismayed by the pricing. It was leaked in advance, but actually hearing that the smaller Pixel would start at $650 was jarring when the Nexus 5X was introduced at a starting price of $379, and had recently dropped to about $300. People have pointed out time and time again that the Pixel phones lack some important features like water resistance and removable storage seen in other phones like the Galaxy S7, but the pricing is very similar. Google probably has a rationale for pricing these phones like it has (namely, identical to the iPhone 7 and 7s), but Nexus fans don’t see anything particularly compelling. Many comments around the internet simply call Google “crazy” for pricing the phones so high. Some especially irked Nexus fans actually seem insulted by the idea they should go back to spending $700-800 on a phone. Those who try to make a case for the pricing of the Pixel are frequently shouted down, and on Reddit, downvoted into oblivion. You could spend over $1000 on the Pixel XL. People are looking toward phones like the OnePlus 3, Axon 7, and Moto Z Play as potential alternatives that aren’t so expensive. It’s hard to say if devoted fans of stock Android will go out and pick up a OnePlus 3, but the “stock Android” situation isn’t even as clear as it once was. That’s the other reason Nexus owners are feeling slighted. Making Nexus a second-class phone The selling point of Nexus phones was always that buyers would get “pure” Android right from Google, with over-the-air updates as soon as they were ready. There weren’t very many features layered on top of the straight AOSP (Android Open Source Project) version of Android for Nexus devices, but buyers were fine with that because they’d always have the newest, most Google-y OS. Now, Google has essentially created their own Android skin for the Pixel, and it’s not coming to Nexus phones. What’s more, Nexus owners are waiting on the 7.1 update like Samsung commoners. The nerve! Nexus owners are probably more upset about this than the Pixel’s pricing. Even if they keep their modestly priced phones, they won’t get all the Android 7.1 goodies like Assistant, the Pixel Launcher, or the Pixel Camera. Some are even using the dreaded F-word to describe this—fragmentation. The decision to make Assistant exclusive is cited as particularly annoying. The decision feels arbitrary, especially considering Assistant already exists in Allo, and voice commands are a thing on Android. Nexus phones won’t get the latest features from Google’s new phone. Android 7.1 is ready to rock on the Pixel, but we still need to go through a developer preview and several months of waiting for Nexus phones to get an update. Even then, the features won’t be the same. The Android faithful repeatedly point out that this all feels like an artificial limitation. Some even compare it to Apple and its tendency to limit new software features to new devices. But maybe it’ll work The biggest Android fans are still grieving over the loss of the Nexus line, but some of the more self-aware admit that the Pixel approach could work. It sets Google’s offerings apart from other devices with mostly stock versions of Android. Google is also spending big on advertising the Pixel.  There’s a lot of ill-will right now, but if the Pixel phones do end up being good, a lot of Nexus fans will come around. The option for monthly payment plans make the higher flagship price more palatable, too. Even people who love their Nexus devices complain about cut corners and mediocre hardware, but the Pixels don’t have as many shortcomings thanks to the higher price. If Google can actually make money on the Pixels, as opposed to subsidizing Nexus phones, we might see even better Pixel-exclusive features later. An Android alternative to the iPhone, with Google in charge of features and updates instead of carriers, is something Nexus was never able to accomplish. For a true Android fan, that’s where you want to be. Tempers will probably cool in the coming weeks, and the Pixels will become the new gold standard for Android.

By Liam Tung | October 13, 2016 -- 10:23 GMT (03:23 PDT) | Topic: Security Google has revealed the top 10 governments by requests for user data in the first half of 2016. Image: Google Google received a record number of government requests in the first six months of 2016, its latest Transparency Report reveals. The US government continues to lead the world in the number of requests it issues to Google for user data in criminal investigations. The company received 14,168 requests for information concerning 30,123 US user accounts between January and June. More than half were subpoenas issued by the government under the US Electronic Communications Privacy Act, possibly without the involvement of a judge, and just under a third were warrants issued by a judge under that act. Google produced data for 76 percent and 86 percent of these requests, respectively, which is consistent with reporting periods since 2014. read this Google Allo: Don't use it, says Edward Snowden Google has come under fire again for the privacy choices its made for its new smart chat app. Read More While the number of requests has steadily risen each period, Google is producing data for a smaller percentage of them these days. For example, it produced user data for 95 percent in the second half of 2010, but back then it received just 4,601 requests. Globally, Google received 44,943 government requests for information about 76,713 accounts during the current period. It produced user data for 64 percent of those requests. Also in the top five by user data requests are Germany, France, India, and the UK, though the percentage of requests where data is actually produced is far smaller than in the US. Google produced data for 59 percent of the 8,767 requests it received from German agencies in the current period. However, against the US trend, Google is now producing data on more occasions than in the past in Germany, up from about 50 percent in 2014. "Before producing data in response to a government request, we make sure it strictly follows the law, for example to compel us to disclose content in criminal cases we require the government use a search warrant, and that it complies with Google's strict policies (to prevent overreach that can compromise users' privacy)," wrote Richard Salgado, Google's director of law enforcement and information security. Google also received its first requests ever from Algeria, Belarus, Cayman Islands, El Salvador, Fiji, and Saudi Arabia. The number of requests made in the US under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) also rose to between 21,000 and 21,499 in the July to December 2015 period, up from between 16,000 to 16,499 in the previous period. Google is required by law to delay reporting these figures by six months. The FISA court can compel US companies to hand over communications from accounts of non-US citizens. Salgado noted that the FBI also lifted a gag order on one National Security Letter issued to Google in the second half of 2015, so now Google has update the figure for that period from 0-499 to 1-499.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel video ads show how determined Google is JC Torres - Oct 13, 2016 19 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has made ads before, some of the amusing, a few of them bewildering. The two new ads for its Google PIxel smartphone falls squarely on the latter group. But more than the fact that these videos have nothing immediately related to the Pixel, other than the fact that they are supposed be about the Pixel, they do point to the one unsaid thing: that Google is really gearing up to take on other OEMs in the smartphone market rat race. Never before has Google been known to pour this much marketing muscle, not to mention money, on a single product. It immediately calls to mind the amount of marketing that the likes of Apple, Samsung, LG, and other have been doing for similar devices. The sizable investment in this not so cheap avenue clearly shows that the Pixel is no Nexus. Ironically, the ads really do nothing to inspire interest in the Pixel, much less a burning desire to wait in line for hours just to get one at launch day. The ads are ambiguous at best but do try to convey a subtle message: that the smartphone is less a hard, cold, device and more an extension of your humanity. The tag lines are also somewhat ironic. No part of the smartphone is actually done “by you”. Neither the final design, unlike say, a Moto Maker smartphone, nor the experience. Instead, everything is actually dictated “by Google”. It’s as if Google simply picked “by you” just so it could have a marketing phrase to parallel “by Google”, which is really what it wants to emphasize on. The minimalist ads that basically say nothing is almost reminiscent of some of Apple’s ads, which usually try to inject a human touch to its devices. Of course, Apple ads have the advantage of people already knowing what an iPhone is. If you haven’t heard of a Google Pixel, however, this add will tell you nothing. Except that it’s made by Google. Not by you.

However, many website owners don’t have a lot of know-how when it comes to optimizing websites for search engines. Today, we’ll impart the essential knowledge to you, so your site has the chance to look good in the ranking, and become successful. SEMrush conducted a study that was meant to collect real data. To do so, anonymous information from about 100,000 websites was collected and evaluated. The results are the eleven most common SEO problems from the technological side, which can have a direct impact on ranking. Problem 1: Duplicate Content Google defines duplicate content as follows: Duplicate content generally refers to substantial blocks of content within or across domains that either completely match other content or are appreciably similar. Mostly, this is not deceptive in origin. Supposedly, duplicate content was found on at least 50 percent of the examined websites. Google usually assumes that the duplicate content was not created on purpose. Thus, there will be no official sanctions for duplicate content. However, that doesn’t mean that a blind eye is turned here, as websites with duplicate content still rank lower than those without it. That’s because the search engine often is unable to determine which version of the content is to be included in the index. Search engines were also developed to make the web a better place for the users in which information can be found easily. Thus, only unique content is considered valuable. Further Information: Test your website for duplicate content with the Duplicate Content Checker Tool. Duplicate Content: Definition and Solutions for Duplicate Content Problem 2: Missing Alt-Tags and Broken Image Links Today, images and graphics are an important part of content marketing. But they can also cause a ton of SEO problems. There are still a lot of webmasters that don’t use the important alt-tags for images, and also don’t make sure that the used images can always be displayed. However, both is important for the search engine optimization. Alt-tags, for example, fulfil two purposes at once. For one, they appear when an image can not be displayed, and they are also necessary for the Google image search. Search engines still are not smart enough to interpret a picture without an alt-tag. Thus, these tags are crucial, as they help Google move the image into specific categories according to their description. The tag also provides the option to enter your SEO keywords, which will make it even easier for Google to categorize the graphics. By the way, visually impaired people also benefit from an optimal alt-tag, as a good description gives them a good idea of what the image shows. Images that are not displayed for some reason cause the same problems as broken links. They lead to a dead end. Both reasons may cause the search engine to degrade your website, as it offers a poor user experience. Problem 3: Title-Tag Problems Search engines use title tags to determine what the page’s text is about. The titles along with a short description appear in the search results. However, the title was what the user would use to decide if he would visit your website or a different one. That’s why the correct title tag is one of your website’s most important elements. An element that may have a positive influence on the ranking. The obvious mistakes made with using these tags are the following: Duplicate Title-Tags – Very Common Too Long Title-Tags – Rather Common Missing Title-Tags are a Problem, but That is Not Very Common Too Short Title-Tags – Very Rare The length of the title tag is critical, as it determines how much of your title will be visible in the search results. The rule of thumb says that Google displays up to about 70 characters. So the title definitely shouldn’t be longer than that. Some SEO tools, like Yoast SEO for WordPress, help you optimize the title tags. Problem 4: The Meta Description In the search results, the meta description is displayed right below the title and is supposed to give the users a good impression of what the article is about. Supposedly, the meta description does not affect the ranking, but I have made the experience that a good description is definitely able to influence the ranking, at least a little. However, a good meta description also results in a better page CTR, which is of particular importance for webmasters that integrate Google Adsense. Many websites have duplicate meta descriptions while others don’t use any explicit descriptions. An SEO tool or a plugin for WordPress can help with that. Further Information: How to create the right meta description Meta Description SEO Best Practices Problem 5: Defective Internal and External Links Defective links have the potential to be a huge SEO issue. One or two of them won’t be a problem. But when your website grows, this may lead to significant problems. Of course, the 404 error page could be set up accordingly, but then, the user will see that error page instead of the useful information he was hoping for. If this happens often, a user will consider the website’s quality to be poor. There is another real problem on top of that. When a lot of broken links are located on your site, you’ll be faced with problems with the bots of the search engines. They always crawl a couple of your pages, and if there are a lot of “broken links,” they might not include these pages in the index anymore. This hurts your website’s authority tremendously. SEMrush found out that 25 percent of the examined pages contained broken external links. Thus, use an SEO tool or WordPress plugin to find these “broken links,” and to fix the problem. Further Information: 5 Steps to Get Your Website Crawled Faster Problem 6: Poor Text-to-HTML Ratio A well-known SEO problem. A couple of websites have a reduced ratio of text in comparison with HTML code. This means that the respective website gives out proportionally more HTML code than readable text. There are many possible reasons for that, like too short texts, for example, which often don’t contain more than the 300 words asked for by Google. However, the reason might also be a poorly coded website or a website that was not taken care of well enough. It could contain a lot of unnecessary code, or boast an excessive use of JavaScript, inline styles, or Flash. Of course, a method popular among spammers where a lot of hidden text is used may also be to blame. Solving This Problem is Rather Simple: Remove the Unnecessary Code. This Reduces the Page Size and Improves the Speed. Check Your Plugins, if You’re Using WordPress. You Don’t Need to Offer Every Single Toy. Only Let JavaScript Load Where It’s Necessary. Expand Your Texts to a Proper Average Length (At Least 500 Words, the More the Better). Problem 7: Problems With the <h1> Tag In practice, this problem occurred to me a lot. Header tags, or headings, are imperative for search engine optimization. For instance, there should only be a single <h1> heading on each of a website’s pages. Although due to HTML5, this dogma doesn’t seem to be as important anymore, the original tags of the headings still provide a useful hierarchy for search engine and user. There are still a lot of websites created by developers, or themes provided for WordPress which use the header tags incorrectly. It also seems to be important to know the difference between title tags and header tags. The title tag is what the search engine gets to see, while the header tags are the ones for the visitors. There is only one title tag per page, while header tags may appear more often, as heading 1, heading 2, and so on. When the valid HTML5 markup is used, the <h1> can be used multiple times on one page, if paragraphs of the same importance have to be labeled. Further Information: The Truth About Multiple H1 Tags in the HTML5 Era Problem 8: Too Low Amount of Words SEMrush was able to determine a too low amount of words in the articles of 18 percent of tested websites. Google does not give out an official minimum number of words, but it is known that Google wants to see at least 300 words used per article. Let’s be honest; even 300 words are far too low for an article average. Google is known for ranking content with much more depth a lot better in the search results. On top of that, an article that dives deep into the matter also gets more backlinks. This, in return, also results in a better position in the ranking. It is rather simple to make articles more extensive if you try to do so. An article with a linked infographic (like this one), can be described in words instead of just the graphic. Your readers will appreciate that. Problem 9: Placing Too Many Internal Links This problem is a tough one to crack. On the one hand, it is important to links articles with each other to help the search engine optimization. On the other hand, it is easy to integrate far too many page links. In the past, Google provided a guideline on the maximum amount of internal links. However, they have dropped this demand by now. Today, a good SEO means creating a natural, internal linking of high quality. The links have to be relevant and useful, only then will Google appreciate the value, and give your page the according rank. So make sure that all of your internal links provide added value for the users. Always keep in mind that whatever is best for the users is also optimal for the search engine. Problem 10: Wrong or Missing Language Declaration The audience on the web is global. As most people are not able to read German content, it is important to declare the default language. Language declaration is necessary for many things, for example: It informs the browser about the language of the content, which is important for translations and the correct display of the pages It makes sure that the content appears in the correct language for screen readers and text-to-speech converters It helps with the GEO localization and the international SEO It helps to improve the important relevance score. Use this list of language codes, to be able to give out the correct language declaration. Further Information: MOZ: Hreflang Tag W3C: Summarized test results: HTML5, the lang attribute Problem 11: Temporary Redirects Redirects are an excellent way to let the search engines know that a page has “moved” and is no longer available under the old URL. These redirects can either be permanent, in which case the status code 301 should be given out, or temporary, where code 302 is used. A permanent redirect with the status code 301 will not result in a loss of authority. Things are looking different when it comes to a temporary redirect; among other things, it might cause an outdated page to be included in the index. The new page might get ignored by Google. This can cause real problems. Thus, if the change is permanent, you should always give out a 301 redirect. This is also the best approach according to Moz. Otherwise, Google might assume that a 302 redirect was supposed to be a permanent redirect and then interpret it as a 301. This can cause a loss of traffic, so you should really take control over which redirect is given out where.

The new Pixel smartphones represent a great opportunity for Google to tap the festive season sales in the country, and are expected to gain traction from consumers looking for alternatives to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, consumers in India have had some questions about the after-sales service for the Pixel phones. (Also see: Hands On With the Google Pixel and Pixel XL) A report published on Wednesday claimed that after-sales service for Google's Pixel smartphones will be handled by HTC in India. However, Gadgets 360 understands that while some HTC service centres will function as the port of call for Pixel customers, the warranty arrangement is no different than what companies use for other products. As reported earlier, Google will have a toll free 24x7 customer care where consumers can call to get help resolve issues related to the device real-time. If further support is required, they will be directed to the nearest customer care centre, which could be a HTC service centre, but these outlets will have Google Pixel branding. This, of course, is a common practice as many service centres across the country function as multi-brand outlets. Google in a statement told Gadgets 360, "Pixel is the first phone made by Google - warranty will be fulfilled by Google." In a statement after the launch of the Pixel smartphones last week, Google had revealed that Pixel users will have access to 54 walk-in service centres across 30 cities in India. A source inside Google told Gadgets 360 that currently Google's partner for after-sales service in India is HTC, but this may change in the future, and more partners may be added. (Also see: Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL: All You Need to Know) To recall, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will be available in India at a starting price of Rs. 57,000 and Rs. 67,000 respectively for the 32GB base variants. The 128GB variants of the Pixel and Pixel XL have been priced at Rs. 66,000 and Rs. 76,000 respectively. Both Pixel smartphones are expected to start shipping in India from "end of October."

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Verizon slays update fears, Pixel variant will have OS updates same time as Google By John Hoff - October 13, 2016 2 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter So we know a number of things – first, that Google has partnered exclusively with US mobile carrier Verizon to sell its new Pixel smartphones. Secondly, we also know from history how tardy Verizon has been when it comes to pushing Android OS updates to the devices it has in its catalog. So we figure people (including us) were well within their rights to be afraid that the Pixel variants sold by Verizon would receive their updates slower than those bought via the Google Play Store. Fortunately for us, Verizon and Google have clarified this issue, and it’s a win-win for you if you’re planning to get a Pixel. Verizon has now killed those fears by putting out an official response to this, talking to the guys at Ars Technica: “First and foremost, all operating system and security updates to the Pixel devices will happen in partnership with Google. In other words, when Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates). Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google.” Google has also verified this response: “OS updates and monthly security patches will be updated on all Pixel devices (Verizon and non-Verizon versions) simultaneously.” So there’s no need to fear of where to buy your newfangled Pixel phone. Before, Verizon handling the updates would have meant delayed updates for your device, but it seems that Verizon is changing its ways. Here’s hoping. Verizon also confirmed that the Pixel devices they will be selling will be carrier unlocked. There is also minimal bloatware installed – just three apps from Verizon which include Go90, My Verizon (account management app), and Verizon Messages (messaging app). The company confirms that all three can easily be uninstalled by users.

Ask Kalena Your Daily Search Engine Advice Column Search Main menu Skip to primary content About Q and A Learn Caffeinate Contact Ask a question Post navigation ← Previous Q and A: Why is my site showing as redirected in the Google Search Console? Posted on October 13, 2016 by Kalena Jordan Hungry? Here - have a feed Hi Kalena, I just checked my Google Search Console and under Crawl, Fetch as Google I see my site status is showing as redirected, with a yellow sign beside it! What does that mean and how can I fix it,  please? Regards Zara ————————————– Hi Zara First up, don’t panic. The *Fetch as Google* tool simply tries to imitate what Googlebot sees when it crawls your site code. It doesn’t mean that Google can’t index your site. If you are still seeing data in the Search Console relating to your site status, all is well. If there were major indexing issues, you would see errors in the Crawl Errors and Site Appearance categories. As for WHY you are seeing a redirect status, without knowing your site URL, I can only guess. But I’m confident it will be one of these reasons: 1)  Domain canonicalization: Does your site load using both http:// and http://www. or does one version redirect to the other? Have you set a preferred domain in Google Search Console? To do this you need to set up views for both versions in Google Search Console and then set your preference. After you’ve done that, depending on which domain version you open within the Console, the *Fetch as Google* tool will show a different status. 1) Fetch as Google results for http://www.searchenginecollege.com 2) Fetch as Google results for http://searchenginecollege.com For example, to avoid duplicate content issues in Google, I have set a) http://www.searchenginecollege.com as my preferred domain in my Search Console, but I also have a Console view for b) http://searchenginecollege.com. On the server side, I have set the non www version to redirect to the www version. This is known by several names, including URL redirecting, domain masking, piggy-backing and parking. If I fetch a) as Google, I see the status as shown in the first image. If I fetch b) as Google, I see the yellow *redirected* status as shown in the second image. This is likely what you’re seeing and it simply means you have set up your domain redirect correctly. Learn more about domain canonicalization and how to set your preferred domain. 2) 301 or 302 redirects: Have you recently switched domains? Although Googlebot follows redirects, the *Fetch as Google* tool does not. So if your site was originally set up in the Google Search Console as one domain e.g. http://www.siteA.com but has now moved to http://www.siteB.com and you set up a 301 or 302 redirect server side, then if you are looking at the original site view in the Console, it will show up as redirected in the crawl tool. You can inspect the HTTP response on the fetch details page to see the redirect details. Learn how to do this. 3) Moving to SSL:  If you have recently updated your site from http:// to https:// and you’re seeing *redirected* in the crawl status, you may have the same domain canonicalization issue as 1). So you need to set up a view for the https:// version of your site in Google Search Console. More info on SSL issues here and here.

An email sent out to Google’s top contributors states the company’s plan for an advanced verification process is being beta tested in San Diego. All locksmiths and plumbers currently verified will have to go through the new verification process. Failure to do so before November 1 will result in the loss of verification and the removal from Google Maps. Of course, any new applications will have to go through the new process as well, which said to be simple. It includes a combination of questions from Google and completing an application with a third party verification company. The new application process is said to take about two weeks to complete. The entire advanced verification process for plumbers and locksmiths in the San Diego area is explained in this Google My Business help article. The process will also be used for plumbers and locksmiths using AdWords. Why Locksmiths? Here’s Why. Did you know that one of the biggest online scams is perpetrated by so-called locksmiths? Google knows, and the issues are finally being taken seriously. It only takes a few bad actors to ruin it for the rest. In this case, the bad actors are individuals or companies claiming to be locksmiths to make some quick cash. Here’s how the scam works. Locksmith Scam: After being locked out of one’s home and not knowing what to do, a quick Google search brings up a list of local locksmiths. Google returns AdWords ads and Google My Business listings for locksmiths promising cheap or inexpensive service rates. Calling one of these bargain locksmiths actually routes you to an offshore call center, where they dispatch someone local to come to your door. The locksmith shows up and, before trying any other options, immediately drills the lock open and slaps you with a large bill for the service. The cheap service you thought you were getting then turns into a large expense. Congratulations, you can now get back into your home but you’ve become a victim of locksmith fraud. This locksmith scam has been well documented over the past few years and even written about in the New York Times. To get an idea of how rampant it is becoming, search for “locksmith scam” in Google. Google’s advanced verification should cut down on the amount of fraudulent locksmiths found in ads and search results. As for why plumbers have to go through an advanced verification, I’m not quite sure. I tried to research online plumbing scams but was unable to find anything. Google is notoriously secretive about why it makes the decisions it does. Regardless, I have reached out for comment in an attempt to gain further information.

They create tens of listings in Google maps using various addresses in surrounding cities to gain more business. So it’s because they do Google Maps spam. There are other professions that could be next, such as pest control, appliance repair and moving companies. Golam Qauser Thanks Google for doing this. Thank you so much for sharing this post. awesome post. love it. keep it up. Alex – New Frontiers Marketing Locksmiths I understand given the scam, but does Google just hate plumbers? I’m sure this kind of advanced verification will be rolled out across loooaaads of different business categories in future too. KFly My guess would be that, like locksmiths, there are many plumbers (and electricians and other tradesmen) who operate a mobile only business with no brick-and-mortar presence. Nelson Dy Wow!

ADVERTISEMENT Along with Pacific Light Data Communication and TE SubCom, the tech giants are joining forces to lay the first cable that directly connects Los Angeles to Hong Kong. It's been called the Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN). How the first cable was laid across the Atlantic How the first cable was laid across the Atlantic Technology 18 Jan 2011 Read more You may soon be able to buy broadband from Amazon Prime You may soon be able to buy broadband from Amazon Prime By Matt Burgess The cable, which will be laid and operational by May 2018, will have 12,800km (7,953 miles) of fibre optics and have a huge capacity of 120 terabits per second. This will make it the "highest-capacity trans-Pacific" cable in existence – the record is currently held by Google's 'Faster' cable. The cable will increase the amount and speed of internet traffic that can travel between the US and the autonomous Chinese territory. "PLCN will provide enough capacity for Hong Kong to have 80 million concurrent HD video conference calls with Los Angeles," Google's director of networking infrastructure Brian Quigley said in a blog post. To allow for the high capacity, the cable will use new technology from TE SubCom. The C+L band tech is said to be able to "double" the capacity of the bandwidth per fibre. Wei Junkang, the director of PLDC, said it will be an "ultra-high-capacity" cable.

According to TeleGeography, there are currently 359 active and planned undersea cable systems around the world.

Most cables ultimately help to connect major internet exchanges – for example the London Internet Exchange or the Los Angeles Internet Exchange – to the outside world. The SEA-ME-WE 3 cable that connects Europe to Australia and Asia is the longest cable in the world. It has 39 landing points and is 39,000km in length. Increasingly, internet cables are being built by internet giants. This is to help them carry private user data across networks. On October 12 Nokia said it had demonstrated a 65 terabit-per-second transmission using dual-band fibre amplifiers in its test lab. Google said it now has ownership in six subsea cables. Tim Stronge, the vice president of TeleGeography, told WIRED the new cable is the continuation of a new trend. "Large content providers have huge and often unpredictable traffic requirements, especially among their own data centers," he said. "Their capacity needs are at such a scale that it makes sense for them, on their biggest routes, to build rather than to buy. Owning subsea fibre pairs also gives them the flexibility to upgrade when they see fit, rather than being beholden to a third-party submarine cable operator." ADVERTISEMENT Despite companies wanting to own their own cables, Stronge says, there is a lot of spare capacity in existing subsea systems to last for a long time. "The issue is that the content providers want to own fibre pairs rather than buying capacity from third parties. Thus, the areas that are receiving the most attention for new cable builds are the routes that connect major data centres of the content providers." The Faster cable, part owned by Google, became operational in June. Costing $300 million (£222m) the pip travels 9,000km (5,592 miles) between Japan and the West Coast of the US. It's capable of 60 terabits per second capacity. In May, Facebook and Microsoft announced they would be building a new underwater cable across the Atlantic. The Marea cable will offer speeds of 160 terabytes per second and is due to be constructed in 2016.

The most well known and undeniably expensive examples out there are the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Those are full on virtual reality solutions that require a hefty computer to make use of but did you know that the smartphone you have in your pocket can also be converted into a virtual reality viewer? All it needs is an accessory like the Homido VR Headset and a little bit of software and you’re ready to experience 3D on the go without the need for a fancy computer or tangled up cables. The Homido VR Headset is basically a container for your smartphone not unlike what Google Cardboard or Samsung Gear VR is. While it costs more than the free Google Cardboard solution, it is much better made and actually looks like a VR unit. What you’re really getting here is a very well made, plastic Google Cardboard like device that doesn’t need to be constructed and you won’t ever have to worry about accidentally breaking it or having your phone slip out of it. This is a heavy duty piece of kit here that improves upon the standard Google Cardboard experience in every way. It even has straps on it like the Google Gear VR units, it just doesn’t have all the extra sensors. Not only that, you’re device is kept secure using some rather nice adjustable brackets and magnets to keep everything in place. Another difference is the inclusion of adjustable knobs that should allow anyone one use the Homido VR Headset comfortably. You can adjust the distance between the two lenses as well as the distance of the lenses from your eyes. Even people with glasses can use this. The headset also allows for different sized smartphones, anywhere from smaller a 4” screen to a larger 5,7” inch screen device. An iOS device or Android deice is recommended as is a quad-core device with an accelerometer and, gyroscope. There’s even a button on the headset that lets you make taps on your screen when pressed. Now that we got the hardware out of the way, your next step to enjoying the Homido VR Headset is to download the Homido Center app which is essentially a catalog of all the apps compatible with the headset. All you need to do now is find the app you want to use, download it, and hit play before inserting it into the Homido VR Headset. Usage of the Homido VR Headset is very similar to that of Google Cardboard, but you have full use of your hands because you don’t need to hold this up to your face. That means if need be, you’ll be able to use this with a Bluetooth gaming controller if the app you’re using requires it. With that said, the Homido VR Headset is a pretty good introduction for those who are curious about VR but don’t want to quite spend hundreds of dollars on the more advanced units yet. The Homido VR Headset will give you a taste of what you can do with VR at a very affordable entry price if you want a device that is made out of something more durable than cardboard.

The decision was inevitable with several media reports confirming that almost five Note 7 replacement devices caught fire within a span of two weeks. While this comes as a major setback for Samsung in India, it has also disappointed many Samsung loyalists who were eagerly waiting to buy the Note 7. TechCircle lists the top five Android smartphones one can buy as an alternative to the Note 7: Google Pixel XL: Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phones made by Google ‘inside and out’. Google’s Pixel smartphone comes with best-in class camera, the Google Assistant, unlimited photo and video storage and 24/7 live customer support. The phone has 4GB RAM, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, a fingerprint sensor and rear facing camera with 12MP. It runs on Google’s most recent mobile operating system—Android 7.1 Nougat. The Google Pixel XL is up for pre-orders on Flipkart and the 128GB version is priced at Rs 76,000. Moto Z: Lenovo-owned smartphone-maker Motorola recently announced the launch of Moto Z, its modular smartphone in India. The new modular smartphone will connect ‘Moto Mods’ magnetically to the device to deliver advanced functions such as better audio, camera etc. The Moto Z smartphone features a 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display and is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. The phone comes with 4GB RAM and is loaded with a 2600-mAh battery, which Motorola claims gives 24 hours of battery life. On the imaging front, Moto Z has a 13MP, f1.8 camera with optical image stabilisation and laser autofocus rear camera and front-facing 5MP camera. The phone is priced at Rs 39,999 and will be available on Amazon.in and Flipkart starting 11:59 pm, 17th October. OnePlus 3: The smartphone was launched earlier this year and has managed to impress everyone with its solid hardware and superior specs. The OnePlus 3 houses a 5.5-inch full HD (1080p) Optic AMOLED display and packs inside the new quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor (up to 2.2 GHz). The OnePlus 3 boasts of 6 GB RAM and 64GB of storage. It features an improved, more durable ceramic fingerprint sensor that improves accuracy with increased use. The phone is available for Rs 27,999 on Amazon.in. Samsung S7 Edge: The Samsung S7 Edge remains as one of best phones in the premium category. The Samsung S7 Edge was launched alongside the Galaxy S7 device in March 2016 in India. The Galaxy S7 Edge sports a 5.5-inch QHD Super AMOLED display and is powered by 4GB of RAM. On the imaging front, the phone comes with a 12-megapixel rear camera and 5-megapixel front camera with f/1.7 aperture. It boasts of a big 3600mAh battery. The phone is available for Rs 50,900 on Flipkart. Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe:  Taiwanese handset maker ASUS launched the Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe alongside ZenFone 3, ZenFone 3 Ultra and ZenFone 3 Laser in India in August 2016. ASUS claims that the phone is the world’s first all-metal smartphone. ZenFone 3 Deluxe has Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and is powered by 6GB RAM. It offers 23MP camera, which the company says, is the world’s first smartphone implementation of the Sony IMX318 image sensor.

By Sarmistha Acharya October 13, 2016 10:40 BST Google and Facebook to co-build Pacific Light Cable Network between Los Angeles and Hong KongGetty Images Google said it is working with Facebook and other tech partners on a project to build a trans-Pacific undersea cable network. Hong Kong-based Pacific Light Data Communication and TE SubCom; a company pioneered in the undersea communications technology and marine services are also part of the project. This new submarine cable system dubbed the Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) between Los Angeles and Hong Kong will provide ultra high-capacity transmission. Once the work is complete, the cable system with 12,800km of fiber, will transmit data at 120 Terabytes Per Second (Tbps), which is equivalent to providing people in Hong Kong with 80 million HD video conference calls with Los Angeles simultaneously. In July Google had announced the launch of the trans-Pacific undersea internet cable service in partnership with five other companies, connecting Japan and the US, following successful construction and testing processes. The 9,000km submarine cable system dubbed Faster is capable of transferring data at 60Tbps. Brian Quigley, director at Google Networking Infrastructure, who made the announcement, said that the commercial launch of the new submarine cable is expected in summer 2018. This is the sixth submarine cable network in which Google has an ownership. The internet giant hopes the cable system would bring greater bandwidth along with more security to its users in the Asia Pacific region. PLDC chairman Wei Junkang in a statement said, "PLCN will be among the lowest-latency fiber optic routes between Hong Kong and the US and the first to connect directly using ultra-high-capacity transmission." "PLCN will showcase the ultra-high-capacity designs and industry-leading wet plant technologies that have enabled TE SubCom to become the manufacturing partner of choice for the world's most advanced undersea networks," said Aaron Stucki, president of TE SubCom.

The fiber-optic cable will have a bandwidth of 120 terabits,  enough to download 160,000 HD films in a single second. Google says makes it the highest-capacity route between the US and Asia. It’ll double the current record, which is held by a cable that Google is also a partner on. The new cable should allow Google and Facebook to offer a faster and more reliable service to visitors on the other side of the Pacific.

 The 10 things in advertising you need to know today Lara O'Reilly Oct. 13, 2016, 5:20 AM 1,815 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ronald McDonald is staying out of the limelight while the creepy clown craze remains rampant. Getty Good morning. Here's everything you need to know in the world of advertising today. 1. Two of Google's ad measurement metrics have been suspended from the Media Rating Council, an accreditation service advertisers and publishers use to verify their ads are being properly measured, over "non-compliance" issues. The two metrics suspended are Google's DoubleClick for Publishers mobile web impression measurement and DoubleClick for Publishers viewability metrics. 2. Hillary's Clinton's campaign drew inspiration from the Apple logo. Wendy Clark, a marketing executive who is currently CEO of DDB North America, compared Clinton's "window logo" in development at the time to Apple's famous rainbow logo in an email included in the John Podesta emails leaked by Wikileaks.  3. Warner Bros. is close to buying Machinima, a YouTube multi-channel network for gaming videos. The deal reportedly values the company at under $100 million, barely more than the $92 million in venture capital Machinima has raised since it was founded in 2000. 4. Amazon has doubled its stock price in just 17 months, but Wall Street still sees another 20% upside. Big firms like Evercore, RBC, and Bernstein have each raised their AMZN price targets to $1,000 in the past few weeks. 5. Teen makeup artist James Charles became the first male CoverGirl. Charles has nearly 515,000 Instagram followers. 6. BuzzFeed is now selling merchandise created by its illustrators and designers. Shop BuzzFeed is part of a "proactive" commerce strategy, according to BuzzFeed's head of commerce, Tessa Gould. 7. The legendary creator of "Doom" warns that Facebook's biggest bet is "coasting on novelty." John Carmack warned that VR developers need to start being harder on themselves and producing things that have the same value, or more value, than other non-VR things. 8. Chipotle is giving away free burritos to customers who play an online game. The "A Love Story" game is a clone of the Concentration card game where you have to match sets of cards before the time runs out. 9. McDonald's is scaling back appearances of Ronald McDonald due to the creepy clown craze, according to AP. The fast food chain told AP it is being "thoughtful in respect to Ronald McDonald's participation in community events" as a result of the "current climate around clown sightings in communities." 10. It looks as though the amount of iPhone users selecting the "Limit Ad Tracking" option hasn't really increased since the release of iOS 10, which has more stringent anti-tracking technology. That's according to a report from mobile market researchers Adjust.

If you're hoping to protect your Google Pixel from bumps, drops, and scratches, you'll need a suitably tough phone case. Here are some of the best Google Pixel cases that will keep your phone intact, without compromising on style: WATCH: Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on Related: Google Pixel hands-on Pixel Case by Google Unsurprisingly, Google has crafted its own snazzy range of cases for the Google Pixel. They're not cheap, but you can bet they'll fit like a glove, because they're coming straight from the source. The Pixel case comes in a choice of five colours, and is made from a combination of three materials: there's a silicone exterior for grip and shock absorption, as well as a polycarbonate core, and a soft microfibre interior. Fancy, right? Buy now: Pixel Case by Google at Google (£29) Pixel Case by Google - Clear Related: Google Pixel vs Google Pixel XL Google has also built a second type of Pixel phone case, which is made from clear material. It's perfect if you want to show off the Pixel's design, rather than covering it up in plastic. That means everyone will still be able to see the phone's most striking external feature – the glass panel on the rear. This appears to be a much thinner, simpler case than the regular Pixel Case, so we suspect it won't offer quite the same protection. As a result, though, it's a fiver cheaper. Buy now: Pixel Case by Google - Clear at Google (£25) Live Case by Google The third and final case Google offers for its Pixel phone looks a lot like the regular Pixel Case. The main difference, as far as we can see, is that you're allowed to specify a snazzy design for it and customise the colours. Google has split this into three categories: Artworks (curated designs), Photos (your own images), and Places (Google Maps locations). Each one will also provided an accompanying live wallpaper to go on your Pixel. Buy Now: Live Case by Google at Google - Artwork / Photos / Places (£35) LK Ultra If you hate the fact that cases spoil the aesthetics of a phone, but begrudgingly accept that you need one, then you're probably a fan of the thin and clear approach. However, you're probably also not inclined to pay £25 for one like Google's official solution. The LK Ultra is an example of a case that offers the same attributes for a fraction of the cost - and you can get it in a number of tints, too. Again, this isn't going to provide the comprehensive protection of a multi-layered case, but it'll fend off everyday bumps and scratches. Buy Now: LK Ultra at Amazon.co.uk from £5.99 | Amazon.com from $7.99 Incipio Carnaby Related: Google Daydream View hands-on This one only seems to be available in the US at present, but it's seriously stylish. Indeed, the Carnaby's cloth finish reminds us a little of the Daydream View VR headset that accompanies the Pixel, so you could say it's a faithful approach. In addition to looking good, you also get a sturdy hard shell and shock-absorbing polymer construction, along with TPU button coverage. With shipping (but excluding any possible customs charges), it'll work out to around the same price in pounds. Buy Now: Incipio Carnaby at Incipio ($34.99) Spigen Rugged Armor Case maker Spigen can always be trusted to turn out solid, chunky cases that will keep your phone safe from otherwise calamitous drops. And they're typically well-priced, too. The Rugged Armor provides Air Cushion technology on the corners to absorb shocks, and a raised lip to keep the screen safe in the event of a droppage. It also has button covers, and the design reflects Google's own with a contrasting panel around the fingerprint sensor opening. Buy Now: Spigen Rugged Armor at Amazon.co.uk from £8.99 | Amazon.com from $19.99 Speck Presidio Grip Speck is one of the biggest names in smartphone cases, so it's always worth taking a look at its offering for a new phone.

The app can now automatically generate animated GIFs from videos you upload to the service. Google says its technology looks for video segments that capture activity – "a jump into the pool, or even just an adorable smile" – and creates short animations that can then be easily shared over email or social media. In addition, Photos now uses facial recognition to surface older pictures of people that appear in your most recent uploads, and can also serve up what it considers to be picture 'highlights' from each month – similar to Apple's Memories feature in its native Photos app. Last but not least, Google Photos now detects sideways photos in your uploads and offers to rotate them in one batch, saving you from having to correct their orientation yourself one by one. Google Photos is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store.

Though I have 2 feature suggestions that would make the app a lot better... The first is a duplicate finder. The second feature is "smart albums" that allows you to add filters, for example an album that automatically detects all photos taken at a certain place, or an album that detects all photos that includes Person X and person Y together. Apple has a lot of things to learn from Google Photos...

I recently had the experience of having my 15 year old meet up with friends he had not seen in 7 years. Google identified all three kids as being the same people as when they were kids. Scary indeed!

Search same 800 phones in Google Photo for "dog": 38 results, all dogs. Always thought this will naturally occur, but now Google appear to finally be taking phones seriously, so they may wish to start (slowly) eroding Apple. Google is really amazing at the actually coding aspect of software. Innovation is pretty good as well (creativity in new features, etc.) but their delivery of products is very lackluster. Apple is much better at delivering products and services; providing a much more complete package (ecosystem, all features working hand in hand, etc.). In this manner, I think google is a much smarter company, and appreciate their work very much. The problem with Google is they release some amazing products/services, then some other really good ones which suddenly die after 18 months, or get incorporated into something else entirely. That's why Google Photos is a surprising hit on every level. It's as revolutionary as Gmail was. But something like this awesome new app Google Trips? I'm not going to get too attached to it!! Rating: 2 Votes miknos 5 weeks ago Amazing service. They should be more straightforward about compression (unlimited option), specially on videos. Rating: 1 Votes diamond.g 4 weeks ago I've tried Google Photos, and if I wanted to store all my photos in the cloud I'd switch to it rather than pay for iCloud storage, but at the moment I store all my photos on my laptop. The main issue I have with Google's offering is the lack of editing tools. I'm not a serious photographer but the iPhone's lens works well in good light and the editing available are good. Sometimes I need to enhance the shadows, increase the brightness and saturation slightly and occasionally the white balance (less so with the 6S, but my 5S needed it regularly). The latter has to be done on the Macbook unfortunately. As far as I can tell, Google doesn't offer this. Look into Snapseed.

Today, it’s an entirely different world for small businesses. In addition to keeping up with customer service demands, you’re challenged to stay in tune with search engine algorithmic changes, emerging social media channels, and online reputation management to stay afloat. It’s intimidating: the vast majority of those looking for products and services locally will still start their journey on the internet. With a few keystrokes, they can change the course of your balance sheet. What can a small business owner do to stay - and come out - ahead? What's Local SEO? Local SEO, while sounding complicated, is all about making sure that the customers who are looking for what you have to offer can actually find you. By creating a website that serves their needs and online presence that makes you more visible, you can refer and build relationships with more customers. Don’t get hung up on the technical aspects of SEO to start with. Instead, approach local SEO from the perspective of, “How can I help more people find what they are looking for through my communication channels?” Believe it or not, now more than ever, businesses of all shapes and sizes have the unique potential and opportunity to get themselves in front of people they can help. Those problems you want to solve? Those people you want talking about you? They’re all within reach - and it starts by laying out a strong foundation for getting found. Unfortunately, there are a lot of missteps along the way. To give you some tools and tips before you dive into putting together your own local SEO strategy, let’s start first with what NOT to do. With so much information (and misconception) surrounding online marketing in general, it’s good to have an idea on what pitfalls to avoid before you start implementing tactics of your own. Pitfall #1: Ignore Your Reviews Some rights reserved by allyaubry Reviews, both positive and negative, are an opportunity to build your online reputation. Every time a prospective customer searches for products or services you offer, they’re looking for votes of confidence in what your business offers in relation to the competition. Customer currency today can be measured in star ratings - and if you’re not keeping an eye on yours, you’re missing a huge chance to make an impression. Online reviews on trusted third parties such as Facebook and Yelp are often where searchers and potential customers go when they’re evaluating prospects. In addition, signals from third party review sites and from Google properties like Maps can influence the way your site appears in local searches. Start building a habit to keep a pulse on what others are saying about you online. You can use tools like Google Alerts, Social Mention, Reputology, ReviewPush, Review Trackers, Merchant Centric, or Reputation.com to track and respond to reviews easily and quickly. Or, you can monitor the key review sites in your industry or geographic area manually. From there, evaluate and respond to reviews, both positive and negative. Businesses that respond to reviews often have a greater chance of gaining improved star ratings over time and are perceived to be more trustworthy and conscientious of their customer communities. With speedier response times to customer feedback and a stronger insight into what’s being said about you, you can only improve your business and its reputation. On the subject of review velocity, also include calls to action to leave reviews in your other marketing efforts. Everything from having signage at your point-of-sale to including links to your reviews on your website can support more customers leaving reviews across the web, and that means: Greater potential for appearing higher in local searches Greater potential for appearing higher in searches on the individual review site Positive customer perception about the quality of your business Pitfall #2: Muddy Your Business Signals Let’s say you’re a bakery who specializes in wedding cakes. A bride from outside the area is researching bakeries to whip up something special just in time for the big day. She starts her search on Google Maps and starts looking for well-rated bakeries close to the venue. Your listing comes up and she’s delighted. There are positive reviews and the address looks like it’s close to the wedding venue - perfect! She grabs the phone number from your listing and dials. There’s only one problem: it’s your old number - and it’s not set up to forward. “The number you have reached is no longer in service.” A few clicks later and she’s on your competitor listing, making another call. Missed opportunities like these are what can be some of the most frustrating experiences for small business owners. In local SEO, your business name, address, phone number, and URL are so incredibly important. If your listings on other websites are inconsistent, outdated, or just plain wrong, the effects can be both frustrating and devastating. Make it a point to audit your local citations on a recurring basis to make sure that your key business information is accurately represented across the web. Moving locations, changing phone numbers, or making changes to your business name are all events that can muddy your business signals. Even if you haven’t make significant changes to your business, there’s still the chance for a stray typo to throw off your profile or make it more difficult for you to be found in local search. There are several options to monitor and update your local listings on sites like Google My Business, YP, Foursquare, or other key channels. The manual way involves doing a lot of searching and updating of sites individually. If you’re a sole proprietor or already stretched thin, this task is daunting.There’s usually a lot of research involved, it can be a significant time investment, and the management of your business info can become a bit unwieldy. Thankfully, there are some great services and tools out there like Moz Local, Bright Local, Yext, SinglePlatform, Whitespark, Universal Business Listing, and others that make it easier to manage your local citations in one place. Pitfall #3: Neglect Your Website “I don’t have time for one.” “I already have too many customers - can you turn off my website?” “I just use Facebook. I don’t need any other business listings.” Believe it or not, these are all things I’ve heard personally from business owners when asked about why their website was out of date, or in some cases, non-existent. Despite the fact that more than 70% of users use search engines in starting their customer journeys, some small businesses are unwilling or unable to adapt to how people have begun to go about finding their product or service providers. Your website is a direct reflection on your business as a whole. Think of it as an extension of your showroom or waiting area. It is both your entryway and storefront - only it’s open 24/7 and customers expect more than just its presence. Customers demand your site to be accessible, full of key business information, and easy to use. They want it to be attractive, responsive (or at least mobile-friendly), quick to navigate, and clear about what you offer to solve their problems. If possible, they want to see it personalized to them, the geographic region they are searching in, or related directly to whatever question they’re trying to answer. Like a skilled member of your team, they want your website to guide them, serve them, delight them, and educate them. Make sure your website fulfills those customer needs and is up to date with the right information to answer their questions or give them a positive impression. If you’re not sure where to start, take a look at your own browsing habits and expectations. Do you bounce quickly from a site that doesn’t load fast enough? Do you get frustrated when you can’t find the hours for a location or see what brands are carried? These are the things you should be running through on your own site to start with to make sure that you’re only offering a great experience for people who arrive on your site. If you have a great site, you can boost your user engagement once they land on your page, reduce bounce rate, drive traffic, and encourage higher rankings. Did I mention better conversions, too? Pitfall #4: Avoid Being Social Have you ever come across a Facebook page that was created 3 years ago but hasn’t seen an update since? Like a blog that still has that “Hello, world!” post but no other updates, an un-updated social profile is as good as no social profile at all. Social media works best when you’re, well, social! While you don’t have to spend all of your time on your pages, it is important for you to have at least some sort of social strategy so that you can work on building a presence that actually delivers a return on investment. Make a schedule for yourself to post regularly and engage regularly with customers. Responding to reviews and direct messages is key, but also look at encouraging conversation directly on your posts. Ask open ended questions, host polls, or post about topics that your customers are interested in. Businesses who have active social media presences often see a correlation with higher search rankings. In addition, social media creates additional touch points with potential customers who may choose to research you or visit your site in the future. After all, isn’t social media just another example of digital word of mouth? Pitfall #5: Be A Best Kept Secret While it may be tempting to set and forget your website or online marketing presence, it’s a fatal mistake to build it and expect customers to flock. Building a reputation online and gaining momentum around being found in your community takes time and investment. Like the rapport you build with customers, it requires ongoing effort to ensure that you can be found by customers past, present, and future. Integrating a great website, accurate local citations, social media, and a strong online reputation with other marketing channels is an area where some businesses stop short. Sure, they may have some of the right pieces, but perhaps they’re missing a key opportunity to tie things together by adding cohesive branding. Or maybe they have the potential to do more to reach their returning customers but just haven’t taken the plunge into email marketing yet. Whatever the reason might be for not having a fully-rounded online presence, the key thing is to take a look at what you do have and ask yourself these questions periodically: How are people finding me? Who am I not reaching effectively? How can I better communicate with all of my customer groups? A pulse check on your overall stack of communication tools can be a great way to ensure that you don’t let your efforts slip, no matter how busy your season may get or whatever other challenges may come up. I promise it’ll be worth the effort.

The new update is rolling out gradually with the focus on developers. In addition to the addition of new developer features and improved developer tools, the company has added the ability to convert Flash YouTube embeds to HTML 5. This comes right after Google announced that Chrome will prefer HTML5 over Flash content online. Even though YouTube decided to roll out HTML5 by default in January 2015 but still the old video embeds were all over the internet. To take care of the old embeds, Chrome 54 will overwrite the Flash embeds with HTML5 embed style as reported by Ventrue Beat on how Chrome 54 will convert the embeds. Chrome 54 also fixes many security bugs that were worth approximately $29,000 in the Bug Bounty program by Google. Google recently reported that the upcoming version, Chrome 55 will use less RAM and run lighter to improve the performance. Chrome 55 is set to arrive around late November. The browser also seems to have fixed its UI to scale to high-DPI screens as reported by the users. Even though, some users think that it is a bug and will be fixed later. We could not verify the claims by the users but this update is significant for a impoved performance of the browser and in addition, the security of the system.

The Silicon Valley firm now has until October 13 to answer questions about its Google Shopping search engine, October 26 for its Adsense advertising business and October 31 for its Android mobile phone operating system. "In each of these cases, Google asked for additional time to review the documents in the case file," according to an official from the European Commission, the executive of the 28-nation union.

Brussels has accused Adsense of restricting some websites from displaying ads from Google's competitors. The EU has also recently beefed up its charge sheet in an earlier case against Google which alleges that the firm abused the dominance of its search engine for online shopping.

Around two million Britons will own one by the end of 2016. With prices ranging from under £10 for a Google Cardboard headset to £770 for an HTC Vive, VR headsets will generate £62 million worth of sales in Britain this year. The lower-cost headsets, which are basically ‘shells’ into which people slide their smartphone – such as Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear – will account for the vast majority (92 per cent) of units sold. Those which attach to games consoles, such as the PlayStation VR launching on Friday and costing £350, will account for 7 per cent. Just 1 per cent of sales will go on the likes of Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets that plug into PCs. “Despite the rush of companies eager to jump in, the reality is that VR take-up among the British public will be a slow burn and dominated by low-cost headsets,” said David MacQueen from Strategy Analytics’ global wireless practice. “The VR headset market will be much like the car market – most owning the likes of Vauxhalls and Fords, a handful owning Porsches and the odd few splashing out on a Ferrari.” MacQueen emphasises the big gulf between price and quality: “The experience of a Google Cardboard versus an HTC Vive is as different as listening to a car stereo versus being in the front row of a concert.” The ‘slow burn’ is shown that by the end of next year, 10 per cent of British adults are estimated to own a VR headset, rising to nearly one in five in 2018 and over one in four (27 per cent) in 2019. “To put its popularity in context, it will take at least five years for VR headsets to reach the level of household penetration that say Sky TV has now,” notes MacQueen. However, it’s estimated that by 2020 one in three British adults will own some form of VR headset. “Despite the slow start, there’s a real opportunity in the longer term,” he says. “VR can bring new experiences to people beyond the obvious next step in video games. There’s also watching sport right in amongst the action, enhanced communications and social networking, plus more serious uses such as better educational materials for kids or use in architecture and design.” Related posts: IDC: Over 9m VR headsets to ship this year VR headset sales flatline 2.3m US broadband homes own VR headset Sony £350 VR headset this October Analyst: Consumer VR content to reach $8.3bn You must be logged in to post a comment Login LATEST NEWS Millennial interest in TV sport waning Videocon d2h merging with Dish TV CEA: 2016 a banner year for 4K TV BT to transform YouView TV service US pay-TV services cut sub losses EBU calls for DTT spectrum legal certainty ITV “limited visibility” for 2017 OCS goes OTT Greece to restart TV auction Adobe to acquire TubeMogul Search Archive Select a Month Click to Select November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 0 Select a Category Click to Select Articles Broadband    Cable    Equipment    FTTH    ISP    Satellite    Telco    Test & Monitor Broadcast    Advertising       Ads       Targetted    Digital Radio    DSO    DTH/Satellite    DTT/DSO    FTA    Pay TV    Services    VOD       Catch Up       Premium Business    Funding    IPO    Joint Venture    M&A    People    Regulation       Policy       Spectrum       Standards    Results Content    app    CA/DRM    CDNs    Games    Piracy    Production    Rights    UGC    VR    Work flow Events Guest Blog    Inside Satellite    Off Message    Third Party Headline In Home    Home Network    PVR    STB Magazines    EuroMedia    IPTV Mobile    APPS    Companion devices    MNO    Mobile TV    Portable Media OTT    Connected TV    HbbTV    IPTV    Middleware       IPG       Search/Recommendation    OTT    UGC Photo Press Releases Research    Consumer Behaviour    Equipment    Markets Research Library    Research TV Channel Social Media UHD    Equipment    Production    Ultra-HD/4K Video White Papers Search by Keyword Broadband Broadcast Business Content In Home Mobile OTT Research Social Media UHD White Papers Shop Advertise Events Library Press Releases Newsletter Register About Us Copyright Advanced Television Ltd © 2001–2016 Maintained by Elrond Limited Advanced Television Cookies Policy Our Website uses cookies to improve your experience.

Many started questioning whether Verizon would have any say (or delay) in Android updates for its handsets, to which Google confirmed that while security updates will be rolled out by Google, system updates would be controlled by Verizon. However, now Verizon has a different story to tell. The carrier firm explicitly clarifies that it won't stand in the way of system updates, and all Pixel smartphone users will get updates on the same day as unlocked Pixel smartphones brought directly from the Google Store. Google has also confirmed that Verizon devices will receive updates at the same time as non-Verizon versions.(Also see: Google Pixel Price in India, Release Date, Specifications, and More) Verizon told Ars Technica that it won't stand in the way of any big updates from Google, and users will get all updates at the same time as Google. To assert further, the carrier clarifies that it will work just like how Apple pushes iOS updates, and that all updates will happen in partnership with Google.(Also see:Hands On With the Google Pixel and Pixel XL) "First and foremost, all operating system and security updates to the Pixel devices will happen in partnership with Google. In other words, when Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates). Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google," the company's spokesperson told the publication. It also added the Pixel phones sold by Verizon will be carrier unlocked, and reiterated the three bundled Verizon apps can be uninstalled at any point. While Verizon claims that all the system and security updates will happen in partnership with Google, the tech giant had earlier said that the security patches will be handled by it, but the system updates will be handled by Verizon. This irked many users, as Verizon provided no timeline as to when it planned to launch the updates after release. Google has separately validated Verizon's latest statement to Ars Technica, saying, "OS updates and monthly security patches will be updated on all Pixel devices (Verizon and non-Verizon versions) simultaneously." (Also see: Google Pixel vs iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge) This uncertainty had many users questioning if they should take the Verizon deal or not. Furthermore, Verizon was bundling pre-loaded apps that further looked to ruin the true Android experience. It was soon clarified that the apps were removable, and so the exclusive experience could be retained, if the user so preferred. (Also see:Google Pixel Phones in Pictures) In any case, Flipkart is now taking pre-orders for Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones in India. As we already know, the pricing starts from Rs. 57,000, and the e-commerce site promises delivery by October 25.

Bray, 42, was convicted following a sexual encounter with Jennifer Bennett in February 2011. The two met on Match.com, and then got drinks before walking back to Bray’s downtown Bend apartment. Bennett later told investigators that over a five-hour period, Bray raped and sodomized, as well as assaulted her, leading to injuries to her jaw, eye, neck, shoulder, back and genitals. The Bulletin maintained a policy of not identifying Bennett because she was the victim of a sex crime, until an Oct. 1, 2012, story in The Oregonian, where she identified herself, and a subsequent appearance the “Today” program. Bray’s appellate attorney, Kendra Matthews of Portland-based firm Boise Matthews, filed for appeal on three grounds. Matthews claimed the court erred in refusing to order the prosecution to obtain and share Bennett’s Google searches and emails between Feb. 22, 2011, and March 31, 2011. Another claim was that the court erred in not granting a mistrial for prosecutorial misconduct. The appeals court sided with the state on both issues. However, the court overturned the verdict due to a change in case law regarding data containing both personal information and evidence a defendant could use in court. In this case, the issue is a copy of Bennett’s computer hard drive, which has been preserved as evidence. During trial, Bennett admitted to using Google to research whether Bray’s actions amounted to rape. The defense also alleged Bennett might have looked up Bray to see how wealthy he was in deciding whether to falsely sue him for raping her. The defense wanted to use data from her computer and Google to argue this in court. It is up to Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to decide whether to appeal the decision to the Oregon Supreme Court. Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel said he expects that decision to be made within a week. If Rosenblum does appeal, the Supreme Court would then decide if it wanted to take up the case. If not, or if Rosenblum doesn’t appeal, the case would be bounced back to Deschutes County, and Bray would be moved from Two Rivers Correctional Institute in Umatilla to the Deschutes County jail. The defense could submit a motion for bail once Bray is in Deschutes County. Hummel said if that happens, he will oppose it. At that point, a judge would revisit conducting an “in camera review” where a computer expert extracts data from Bennett’s hard drive and gives it to the judge. If the judge finds the evidence the defense argued might be on the hard drive to be of reasonable volume, of relative importance and would be likely to make a difference at trial, the judge would then decide to proceed with the review. In the decision, the appeals court found having a judge and a computer expert view all information to separate personal from pertinent information wouldn’t be a constitutional violation of Bennett’s privacy. At that point, the judge would decide if the new information could have changed the original verdict had it been argued at trial. If the judge finds it would have, a retrial would take place. Hummel said the issue is the clash between Bennett’s constitutional right to privacy against Bray’s constitutional right to confront his accuser. In the end, the appeals court decided more consideration of the issue was appropriate. Presiding Deschutes Circuit Judge Alta Brady would appoint the judge, and could ask retired Judge Stephen Tiktin, the original judge on the case, to take the case as a “senior” judge, Hummel said. Matthews, the appellate attorney who argued the case for the state, could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office declined to comment. While the appeals court did not find grounds to overturn the verdict based on prosecutorial misconduct, it didn’t pull punches in its assessment of then-Deschutes County District Attorney Patrick Flaherty and his deputies. The prosecution repeatedly refused to comply with a judicial order to request Bennett’s information from Google. During trial, the judge called it “foot-dragging.” The appeals court took a sharper tone. “We find the state’s conduct at trial to be seriously disturbing. Its lack of “good faith” with respect to obtaining the Google information was significantly worse than foot-dragging, delay, and defiance of a court order. … Such defiance is nothing short of an attack on the judicial system itself.” Flaherty could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. At one point, the prosecution said it could not get the data because it did not have Bennett’s IP address, and getting it would be costly and inconvenient. According to the appeals court decision, it was later found that the state had Bennett’s IP address on file for more than eight months. The decision also attacked an expert witness called by the state to testify that Google only kept information for 28 days, making going after Bennett’s emails a fool’s errand. The witness was a Bend Police Department officer, who said he got the information from another officer, who got the information from a Google attorney, whose name he could not remember. During a break during the same hearing, a look at the Google website revealed its policy was to keep data for at least nine months. The appeals court called the testimony “double hearsay.” Hummel was not with the office at the time of the trial, and when asked about the comments, mentioned he shared plenty of criticism of Flaherty when the two ran against each other for the district attorney position. However, he did say employees of the office were trying to do the right thing for their client. “Attorneys in this office were fighting to preserve the privacy rights of a victim,” he said. “If they went a bit too far in their advocacy, they can learn from that.” — Reporter: 541-383-0376, awieber@bendbulletin.com 15314527 View next article in Local/State     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

By Eileen Yu for By The Way | October 12, 2016 -- 16:54 GMT (09:54 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Google has confirmed plans to introduce four new cloud regions in Asia, where it is seeing rapid enterprise cloud adoption and aiming to differentiate itself through its pricing structure and granular offerings. Tokyo will be added as a Google Cloud region later this year, supported by three data centres, while Singapore, Mumbai, and Sydney will join the network next year. The cloud vendor currently operates two data centres in Singapore.

Cloud regions support enterprise customers and are added based on the level of demand from its Cloud Platform clients for lower latency, higher speeds, and to store data locally. Currently, Taiwan is the only active Google Cloud region in Asia. There also is only one Europe cloud region, located in Belgium, and three in the US. Apart from the four planned for Asia, the vendor will be adding three more regions in Europe and two in the Americas. According to Rick Harshman, Google's Asia-Pacific managing director for cloud, the vendor was seeing accelerated growth in this region, clocking "well over triple-digit" year-old-year growth rates. He declined, however, to provide figures on how many Google Cloud customers were from Asia-Pacific or how much the region was contributing to the company's overall cloud revenue. In an interview with ZDNet, Harshman explained that Google did not break down its revenue by geographies, but did note that it had 2 million paid customers worldwide on G Suite. The Google Cloud Platform also currently served more than 1 billion end-users. Citing research from IDC, he pointed to strong cloud demand in markets such as Singapore, which was projected to be one of the largest in Southeast Asia, driving cloud revenue of US$1 billion in 2017. The city-state serves as Google's Asia-Pacific headquarters. In a market that already had viable players such as Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google would be looking to differentiate based on a pricing structure Harshman said provided more flexibility. He noted that most cloud players in the markets would provide greater discounts only if customers committed to a year-long or three-year contracts, which locked them into a specific vendor. In comparison, Google provided sustained usage discounts where customers that ran workloads continuously on its platform would automatically discounts of up to 35 percent over the normal running price, he said. Discounts would be triggered from the seventh day of sustained usage, he added. And while its competitors offered per-hour billing, Google provided per-minute billing, he said, noting that customers also would be able to create custom virtual machines (VMs) and be charged based on the customised configuration. He said this billing model could slash the cost of running customised VMs by 19 percent, compared to standardised VMs, and added that customers preferred more granularity in the services they purchased. Whether Google would add new cloud regions to its network would depend on customer demand, said Harshman, but its plans to expand from just five globally to 17 over the next year was an indication of its commitment in this space. In addition, the vendor was looking to add more than 1,000 new hires to its cloud customer teams globally, he added. Asked if Google had plans to re-enter the Chinese market, he noted that many customers operating within and outside of China had been asking the same question. For now, the vendor was assessing all options on how it should approach the market and would reveal more details when it was ready to do so, said Harshman, who had joined Google's cloud unit six months ago after spending almost seven years at AWS, where he helped set up its Singapore team.

By: IANS | New York | Updated: October 13, 2016 12:49 pm Google and Facebook have teamed up with Pacific Light Data Communication and undersea communication solution provider TE SubCom to build the first direct submarine cable system between Los Angeles and Hong Kong with ultra high-capacity. Internet giants Google and Facebook have teamed up with Pacific Light Data Communication and undersea communication solution provider TE SubCom to build the first direct submarine cable system between Los Angeles and Hong Kong with ultra high-capacity. The Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) will have 12,800km of fibre and an estimated cable capacity of 120 Tbps, making it the highest-capacity trans-Pacific route, a record currently held by another Google-backed cable system, FASTER. In other words, PLCN will provide enough capacity for Hong Kong to have 80 million concurrent HD video conference calls with Los Angeles. “Google’s mission is to connect people to the information by providing fast and reliable infrastructure. From data centres to cables under the sea, we’re dedicated to building infrastructure that reaches more people than ever before,” said Brian Quigley, director, Google Networking Infrastructure, in a blog post. PLCN will bring lower latency, more security and greater bandwidth to Google users in the APAC region and will be operational in 2018. In addition to our existing investments in APAC cloud regions and the FASTER cable system, PLCN expands our ability to serve people in Asia, including Google Cloud and G Suite customers, the blog post noted. This is the sixth submarine cable in which Google has an ownership stake, joining the ranks of the Unity, SJC, FASTER, MONET and Tannat projects.

Although ice cream and yeast spreads are trivial compared to, say Aleppo, today’s drama has brought home the consequences of the slump in the pound since June. Here’s our latest news story: Tesco and Unilever settle Marmite dispute Unilever has resolved its dispute with Tesco and says well-known brands including Marmite and Ben & Jerry’s will be back on the shelves. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, the food and household goods supplier said: “Unilever is pleased to confirm that the supply situation with Tesco in the UK and Ireland has now been successfully resolved. “We have been working together closely to reach this resolution and ensure our much-loved brands are once again fully available. For all those that missed us, thanks for all the love.” It emerged on Wednesday that Tesco was running low on a range of household brands from Marmite to Comfort fabric conditioner after a row with its major supplier. Unilever halted deliveries to Tesco after the supermarket refused to stump up across-the-board price rises of about 10% for its brands. A spokesperson for Tesco said: “We always put our customers first and we are pleased this has been resolved to our satisfaction.” The statement appears to suggest the two sides reached a compromise, although neither Tesco nor Unilever would confirm any details of their talks. The quick resolution of the row is good news for Tesco’s boss, Dave Lewis, who previously held a senior role at Unilever. Analysts said the public spat had worked out well for the supermarket, as tabloid newspapers widely portrayed Tesco as a people’s champion on low prices. “When was the last time you saw articles about Tesco as the shoppers’ champion,” said Dave McCarthy, a food retail analyst at HSBC....

GW Updated at 2.12pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.01pm EDT 14:01 Associated Press also found limited sympathy for Unilever, as it struggles to cope with the consequences of Brexit. Here’s some of their latest report: Philip Walker spreads Marmite on his daily crumpet and stockpiles jars of the yeast spread. He’s a fan, and he’s upset at plans to raise the price of this icon of the British breakfast table. Love it or hate it, Marmite has become the most visible sign yet of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union after consumer giant Unilever sought to raise wholesale prices for its products by a reported 10% following a sharp drop in the pound. Tesco, the U.K.’s biggest supermarket chain, has rejected the increase and removed many Unilever products from its website. #Marmitegate was not far behind. “I am more angry at Unilever than I am at Tesco,” said Walker, a 43-year-old regional manager for St. John Ambulance. “It seems Unilever is using Brexit as an excuse to hold Tesco customers to ransom.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.55pm EDT 13:55 Tesco and Unilever will be glad to put this public spat behind them. But consumers should still brace for price hikes in the months ahead. A series of experts have warned today that the weak pound makes this inevitable, even though retailers will try to force suppliers to swallow the cost. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, summed it up: ‘This pricing spat is likely to be the thin end of the wedge when it comes to relationships between UK retailers and their suppliers, in light of the pressures now applied by weaker sterling. This kind of friction is an inevitable result of the unstoppable force of higher import costs hitting the immovable object of UK retail pricing.

Trade insurance group Euler Hermes has warned that more companies would be driven under by a hard Brexit than a more conciliatory divorce. But either way, the prospects aren’t great. The FT has the details: A hard Brexit — a complete break with no access to the single market — would increase the risk of more bankruptcies, it says. Under a soft Brexit it predicts that 25,170 businesses will fail in 2019. Under a hard Brexit that rises to 26,570.

Speaking in Brussels, Tusk argues that Britain cannot expect to retain many of the benefits of EU membership while also leaving the bloc. Instead, he hinted that the prospect of a hard Brexit might force the UK to rethink leaving at all. Tusk says: “It is useless to speculate about ‘soft Brexit. These would be purely theoretical speculations. In my opinion, the only real alternative to a ‘hard Brexit’ is ‘no Brexit’. Even if today hardly anyone believes in such a possibility.” Some UK ministers has argued that terms like ‘hard Brexit’ have little meaning, and that they could carve out a good deal that gave Britain access to the single market while also restricting migration.

Google’s Pixel smartphones, unveiled earlier this month, will take over the mantle of the “Google phone” from the Nexus series of devices. These phones indicate a big shift in Google’s approach to the very competitive Android smartphone space, which includes loading the Pixel phones with exclusive features such as the Google Assistant and also having greater control over the hardware. It seems that last year’s Nexus 5x (made by LG) and the Nexus 6P (made by Huawei), will be the last phones to emerge with the very popular Nexus branding. What happens to the Nexus branding now still remains unclear, but what we have on our hands now are two new smartphones—the Pixel and the Pixel XL. They have been tasked with becoming the benchmark devices for the Android space, and are heading to India later this month. Online retailer Flipkart is now taking pre-orders for these phones, at least on some variants. We take a look at each of these variants, and which other phones it will compete against. Also read : How much will Google Pixel phones cost in India? At the time of writing this, there are two variants of the Pixel and one of the Pixel XL which are up for pre-order. And all three are only available in the Quite Black colour option, as we speak. The entry level spec variant is the Google Pixel, with 32GB internal storage, and is priced at Rs.57,000. This runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB RAM, 5-inch (1920x1080 resolution) display, 12.3-megapixel camera and a 2770mAh battery. This will no doubt come in direct competition with the Apple iPhone 7, which is priced at Rs.60,000—has a 4.7-inch Retina Display (1334x750 resolution), runs the latest and very powerful A10 Fusion chip, has a 12-megapixel camera which remains one of the most consistent performers out there and now also has improved low light performance. If you wish to remain in the Android ecosystem, but don’t care much about running the very latest Android version or the Google Assistant, there are couple of options. Sony’s latest Xperia XZ (Rs.49,990), which runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip, 3GB RAM, 5.2-inch IPS display (1,920x1,080 resolution) and a 2,900mAh battery, is an alternative. But the flagship killer concept is complicating things further for the Pixel. There is the Xiaomi Mi 5, priced at a much more affordable Rs.22,999, runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 5.15-inch (1920x1080 resolution) display, 32GB storage and a 16-megapixel camera. At that price, the ‘risk’ becomes a lot lesser, and the entire package seems a lot more value for money for a lot of users. The second variant is the Pixel with 128GB internal storage, and this is priced at Rs.66,000. The rest of the specs remain the same. This is approximately Rs.4,000 less expensive than the Apple iPhone 7 (128GB), but at these price points, it is difficult to hold that minor price difference as a big advantage for the Google Pixel or a disadvantage for the iPhone 7. What will matter more at the end is which platform you are more comfortable with—Android Nougat 7.1 or Apple iOS 10. Despite many claims about improving the camera performance with new hardware and software based processing, it will probably still require a stellar effort from the Pixel phones to match the updated hardware and algorithms that have taken the iPhone 7’s camera to the next level. Also read | Google Pixel: Everything you need to know All those who prefer a bigger display would no doubt be eyeing the Google Pixel XL. The variant that is up for pre-order is the 128GB storage option, priced at Rs.76,000. The bigger Pixel XL has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip, 4GB RAM, 12.3-megapixel camera, 5.5-inch (2560x1440 resolution) display, and a higher capacity 3450mAh battery. This does have a slight price advantage over the iPhone 7 Plus—Apple’s new A10 Fusion chip, 5.5-inch Full HD display, dual 12-megapixel cameras with optical zoom as well, and 128GB storage. And if you are considering the Pixel XL for the bigger screen, yes, it has the advantage in terms of resolution numbers. But what makes it tougher choice is the camera bit, and photography enthusiasts will probably be better off with the iPhone. However, the surprise option is the OnePlus 3—runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 6GB RAM, a very capable 16-megapixel camera, fast charging 3000mAh battery and a 5.5-inch Full HD display. The only compromise would be that the OnePlus 3 has 64GB internal storage, but we feel that at Rs.27,999, it is also a very capable smartphone to consider. Interesting to note that Flipkart is also offering an exchange scheme with the three Google Pixel phones up for pre-order, with a maximum discount of Rs.27,000, depending on which device you are giving in exchange and the condition of the same. For example, exchanging a Google Nexus 6 will get you a discount of Rs.11,500 while an Apple iPhone 6 will get you Rs.20,400 on a new Pixel or Pixel XL.

Ltd. to co-build a new undersea cable between Hong Kong and US cities with ultra-high capacity transmission. The new route is aimed at expanding capacity for Asia Pacific customers. The companies anticipate that Pacific Light Cable Network or PLCN will be commercially operational in 2018. The PLCN, a 12,800 km transpacific submarine cable system, will include TE SubCom's C+L technology. It will provide the first direct undersea route between Hong Kong and Los Angeles, California with ultra high-capacity. PLCN will have an estimated cable capacity of 120 Tbps, making it the highest-capacity trans-Pacific route. At present, the record is held by another Google-backed cable system, FASTER. Google expects PLCN to bring lower latency, more security, and greater bandwidth to its users in the APAC region. This will also provide enough capacity for Hong Kong to have 80 million concurrent HD video conference calls with Los Angeles. The latest submarine cable is the sixth in which Google has an ownership stake. Google currently backs Unity, SJC, FASTER, MONET, and Tannat projects. According to PLDC Chairman, Wei Junkang, PLCN will be among the lowest-latency fiber optic routes between Hong Kong and the U.S. and the first to connect directly using ultra-high-capacity transmission. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash More Top Stories China's Industrial Output, Retail Sales Rise Less Than Forecast Asian Markets Mostly Lower AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Stocks Close Mixed On The Day But Sharply Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary VP-Elect Pence To Take Over As Head Of Trump Transition Team Airlines Struggle With Computer Glitch Trump To Drop Out Of Trans-Pacific Partnership Within First 100 Days Gohmert Says Congress Can Help Fund Border Wall Singles Day: Alibaba Sales Skyrocket Pence Holds "Warm And Professional" Meeting With Biden Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness Following Post-Election Rally - U.S. Commentary Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy GrubHub CEO: I Did Not Tell Trump Supporters To Quit U.S. Consumer Sentiment Rebounds To Six-Month High In November <<Previous        134 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Google Rejects EU Antitrust Charges Google Shutting Down Map Maker Tool Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out WSJ : Alphabet Pushes Out Leaders Of Drone-Delivery Project Google Redesigns GMail For Ios Trade GOOG now with  Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

Google calls it “a perfectly imperfect VR-ish camera.” Sprayscape allows users to capture 360-degree spherical photos by pointing their phones at the subject and tapping the screen to capture the frame. The app allows users to “spray” photos — use their fingers to capture different parts of their environment. It doesn’t stitch photos together like a panorama, but rather places them on top of each other. "We're interested in exploring ways that anyone with a smartphone can become a VR creator. By taking the pressure of 'perfect capture' out of the equation, we hope people will have fun and get creative with the times and places they use the app," Glenn Cochon, senior designer at Google Creative Lab, told CNET. Related Stories Google Is Building A Standalone VR Headset WATCH: Google Cardboard Pokes Fun At Oculus Rift VR Users can capture moving objects by tapping and holding their screen while pointing at them with the phone’s camera to spray content over a spherical canvas. The app captures Sprayscapes using Cardboard SDK to read gyroscope data and NatCam Unity plugin to control the camera. It renders a camera feed to a texture at 60 frames per second using the phone’s GPU. The three.js web viewer takes the flat image and wraps it into a sphere, making it navigable on mobile by panning, tilting and moving your device. Users need to sign in to their Google accounts to share the Sprayscapes, which are stored on Google Drive. They can also share a Sprayscape on a text message or social media. However, to view a Sprayscape properly, users will need a VR viewer such as Google Cardboard. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.
