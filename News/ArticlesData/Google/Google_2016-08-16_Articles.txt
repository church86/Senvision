Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook 7:00 AM ET Adrienne Green Aug 16, 2016 Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size When today’s tech employees were growing up, the most advanced technology in their households might have been a graphing calculator or a basic computer. Today, millions of people walk around with far more advanced devices in their pockets. Dave Chen, a senior manager on one of Google Play’s engineering teams, has been there to see that rapid change, and to be a part of it. For The Atlantic’s series of interviews with American workers, I spoke with Chen, who has worked in software engineering in Ohio, Maryland, and California, about how Silicon Valley differs from other tech hubs, the quickening pace of industry innovation, and his experience as an engineer. This interview has been lightly edited for context and clarity. Adrienne Green: What inspired you to start working in technology and engineering? Dave Chen: I grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and I always enjoyed programming and coding. In eighth grade, I was taking a geometry class and it required the use of a graphing calculator. We were lower-middle-class, but my parents got me one. It was really my first experience with coding; it was engaging and exciting to create something. I experimented with coding all the way through to college. I ended up being selected for the freshman engineering honors program at Ohio State, and we had to build a robot for our final capstone class. I worked on a team of four people, and we built an autonomous robot that ended up being very successful. During the first year of college, I had a few odd jobs: I worked at a grocery store as a bagger making minimum wage, and then at CompUSA, a computer store, as a cashier. In the summer after my freshman year, I was working at CompUSA again. The professor of my engineering class asked me, “Why are you working here?” He asked me to come work for him at his design center for a startup in Cupertino, California. I worked for him on a part-time and full-time basis for my remaining three years of college. That was my first real professional job being paid for coding. Green: How did you end up at Google? Chen: I got job offers from a couple of different companies after college: IBM and Lockheed Martin. I picked Lockheed Martin because it included a three-year, rotational program that allowed me to get my master's degree in computer science from John Hopkins. After four years at Lockheed, I came over to the Valley. When I got my job offer at Yahoo, I later found out that my hiring manager had a big stack of resumes, pulled one out, decided to interview that person and hire him or her—and that person happened to be me. I worked for Yahoo for two years. At the end of 2008, I interviewed at Google during the height of the financial crisis. After two years of working as a software engineer, I started managing others as an engineering manager at Google Play. Green: What exactly do you do as a software engineer? Chen: I'm an engineering manager at Google. On a day-to-day basis, my job revolves around both short- and long-term strategy for Google Play to build internal-testing tools. If we're successful, that means that the next feature we launch be faster than the past features that we launched. In tech, the goal is to move fast. “I often feel like people who have had minimum-wage jobs have a different sort of flavor.” Green: How is working in Silicon Valley different than working in Ohio or Maryland? Chen: In Ohio, I was technically working for a company in the Valley, but it had this Midwestern feel. In Silicon Valley, the pace is a quicker. Compared to Maryland, the value systems and pace, and drive for innovation might be a little bit different. I think Silicon Valley attracts this very interesting sort of person. Coming from the Midwest, I always tell people my first job was a minimum-wage job, and I often feel like people who have had minimum-wage jobs have a different sort of flavor. In the Valley, everywhere you look there are people pushing for crazy amounts of success. In Maryland, people look at a job as a job and are less concerned about career, whereas in Silicon Valley people are very concerned about their careers. The Valley can be very grounded, but it can also be this place of wild and crazy expectations where people push themselves because they want to be part of that next thing. I don't see that quite so much in Ohio and in Maryland. Green: How do you think working a minimum-wage job and then becoming an engineer has affected how you see work culture? Chen: I was a bagger at a grocery store and we pushed carts around. This was the 1990s and you still put pride in the job. At least I did. I worked with people everyday and their value system was very much focused around who you were outside of work. Who you are in the Midwest largely depends not on your job, but on your family, friends, and hobbies. There are really good opportunities in Ohio, but I think the opportunities in Silicon Valley—that dream of getting there and trying to make it—consumes some people a little bit more. Especially in tech, people are always chasing that next big thing. It can, in many cases, become “This is my purpose in life or my singular purpose.” There are lots of people that are very grounded in the San Francisco Bay Area, but there's always that looking over your shoulder, keeping up with the Joneses kind of feeling: You see those stories or the status symbols or the people. I think in Ohio, that may be looked upon as less of an ideal than it is here. Dave Chen working outside on Google’s campus Green: You talked about the fast pace of your current job a lot. Do you ever feel stressed because of that? Chen: I have friends who work at startups in Ohio, who experience that same sort of stress and fast pace. At Lockheed Martin, there was a strong focus on doing things the right way. When you're in a startup, you're basically looking to survive to the next month or the next quarter. When you look at all the internet companies, it's very easy to see how many have come and gone. Google, or any company, could very well be that next has-been. I think the pace is born out of innovation. We're trying to bring that same sort of development and discipline to software engineering that industries like manufacturing and architecture have achieved. Our job is to focus on how we improve software engineering and make it better, faster, easier for engineers to actually deliver amazing experiences to our users. We could look at it in terms of the competitive nature of Company A versus Company B. I think that's there, too, but for me it's more about, how can we make it so that the next coder in any part of the world can come along and say, “Wow, I have really, really amazing tools to help me create things that never existed before”? Green: What motivates you as an engineer? Chen: For me it's about making a difference. My foundational focus is around the people on my team. Am I doing a good job for them? Am I putting them in the best position to succeed? I went into management primarily because, from a people perspective, if I can help somebody grow and advance to the next thing, or open up more doors and opportunities, that's exciting for me. Secondly, Google Play is a really enormous platform for impacting people. It encompasses both apps on Android phones as well as digital content. If we can do a great job, and focus on the user, then I think we can do great things and that's where I find that motivation. Green: You just mentioned that opening doors for others is important to you, and the lack of diversity in the tech industry is widely known. What has your experience as an Asian American man in Silicon Valley been? Chen: In Ohio, Asian Americans are a minority in the workforce. I guess it’s less so in D.C. and in the Bay area. I think part of what drives me is the motivation to be inclusive. When I was in D.C., I never felt like it was ever a bad thing being a minority. One thing I really advocate for in my personal work is, how can I encourage minorities to get involved in STEM? This is how I got involved in the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers. I was very passionate about seeing how I could help Asian Americans succeed in STEM fields. I wish that I had these stories, or the same opportunities to connect with somebody in the industry who had faced some of these challenges—someone who had learned what was important and how to navigate corporate America. If you look at the different companies I’ve worked at—a startup, Lockheed Martin, which has a more traditional corporate culture, and then Yahoo and Google—they’re actually significantly different culturally. Green: In Silicon Valley, it seems as though Asian Americans are the most highly represented minority. How has that affected the way you mentor other Asian American students? Chen: My parents had immigrated to the U.S. when I was three or four years old. Growing up in the Midwest, where I was  definitely a minority, I remember being bullied. It was challenging growing up as a minority. I'm really passionate about making sure that minorities from whatever background or gender can find a home and can be included and contribute ideas. If we're going to really build products and build a discipline around engineering and around software engineering that incorporates the best of all ideas, we need everybody. Efforts around diversity and inclusion and unconscious bias are critical to the success of not just people in tech but people in industries worldwide. The volunteering is a big part of giving back. I think I’ve been very lucky in my career. Tech exploded, and it was my interest area. So I was lucky to have been part of that. This interview is a part of a series about the lives and experiences of members of the American workforce, which includes conversations with a voice of OnStar, a cartographer, and a medical illustrator.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out.

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Carolyn Kaster / AP The Trump Takeover The Editors After a shocking upset, the president-elect and his party prepare for next year.

Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

Russia to reduce crew on ISS Reports from Russia's TASS news agency indicate that the Roscosmos space agency may reduce the number of Russian crew on the International Space Station from three to two (Ars Technica). Roscosmos's director of human programs, Sergei Krikalev, has reportedly said that the move would allow the space agency to reduce the cost of resupply missions to support its crew members. US space agency and ISS partner Nasa has confirmed that Russia is considering a crew reduction, but has indicated that "any questions about the near-term Russian Space budget or Russian ISS expedition size should be directed to the Roscosmos press office."

Google launches Duo secure mobile video calling Google has officially launched its new Duo video calling app for Android and iOS, first announced earlier this year at the Google I/O conference (VentureBeat). Duo is a mobile-only one-to-one video calling app that's built for speed, simplicity and security, with integrated end-to-end encryption. The app is being rolled out worldwide over the next week, and Android users can pre-register to automatically download it from the Play store as soon as it becomes available in their region. 3. FCC filing reveals partial spec for new HTC Nexus phones The USA's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) telecoms regulator has published data which appears to confirm that HTC will be making the forthcoming Google Nexus smartphones, dubbed Marlin and Sailfish (The Verge). The filing, made by HTC, indicates that documentation for the devices will be hosted by Google and includes information on the communications and networking standards the phones will support. So far, we know they'll support 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE and NFC, but there are no further insights to be gleaned about their specification from the available data. 4. Artificial black hole provides strong evidence for Hawking radiation Israeli experimental physicist Jeff Steinhauer has produced the first strong evidence in support of Stephen Hawking's 1974 prediction that black holes shrink because they emit radiation (WIRED). Prof Steinhauer of the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa has created an acoustic model of a black hole – from which sound, rather than light cannot escape – to observe Hawking-like radiation, which has thus far been impossible to observe in astronomical black holes as it's too weak to detect using current techniques. Steinhauer studied the behaviour of particles behave on the edge of his "black hole" and found that pairs of phonons – particles of sound – appear spontaneously in the void at the event horizon. One of the phonons travels away from the black hole as Hawking radiation, and the other partner phonon falls into the black hole.

Archaeologists reveal wooden 'Superhenge' near Stonehenge Archaeologists excavating a site near Stonehenge, dubbed 'Superhenge' when it was discovered last year, have found that, rather than standing stones, the great structure was made with huge timber posts (Motherboard). Situated a few kilometres northeast of Stonehenge, early radar scans led researchers to expect a structure of 90 stone monoliths. Instead, the Bronze Age site appears to have been made using wooden posts and to have been hastily deconstructed in a manner the could indicate political or religious upheaval 4,500 years ago. Nick Snashall of the National Trust said that "what we've discovered are that there are two enormous pits for timber posts. They have got ramps at the sides to lower posts into. They did contain timbers which have been vertically lifted out and removed at some stage. The top was then filled in with chalk rubble and then the giant henge bank was raised over the top." 6. Pokémon Go cheats to be banned for life Niantic Labs has updated the terms of service for augmented reality hit Pokémon Go to introduce new penalties for cheating (TechCrunch). Accounts found to be "falsifying your location, using emulators, modified or unofficial software and/or accessing Pokémon GO clients or backends in an unauthorized manner including through the use of third-party software" can now receive a lifetime ban from the game, although affected users can appeal against bans. The moves follow Niantic's crack-downs on third-party tracking services and, most recently, "farming" services that automate certain gameplay elements by simulating movement, creating serious gameplay imbalances for honest players. 7. Nvidia packs desktop-grade graphics into its new laptop GPUs Nvidia has launched its latest range of laptop graphics chipsets and, like the laptop version of the company's GTX 980, they're effectively indistinguishable from their desktop counterparts, bar the absence of features such as voltage adjustment (Ars Technica). The newly released graphics processors are already available in new heavy-duty gaming laptops from MSI, Asus, Alienware, Lenovo and Razer. The full range of new GPUs includes the GTX 1060, GTX 1070 and, most impressively, the hugely powerful GTX 1080, complete with 16nm Pascal architecture, 2560 CUDA cores and 8GB of GDDR5X graphics memory.

Minecraft is out for the Oculus Rift Microsoft-owned Minecraft creator Mojang has announced that the block-crafting hit is now available on the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset (Popular Science). You'll need both a Rift and a copy of Minecraft for Windows 10 Edition beta, which is still available free to anyone who already has the standard Windows/Linux/macOS Java version. While this isn't the first VR version of Minecraft – that honour goes to the Samsung Gear VR mobile edition – it's the first to take advantage of the power of a desktop virtual reality system, and comes equipped with PC-friendly features, including mouse and keyboard support, and the option of switching from full immersive VR to a "virtual living room" that displays the game on a virtual reality rendition of a standard flat panel monitor. 9. Hidden Figures trailer looks at brains behind Nasa's space race 20th Century Fox has released a trailer for Hidden Figures, a film that tells the often-neglected stories of Nasa mathematicians and computers Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, black women who carried out the critical calculations that fuelled the success of the US space programme during the 1960s (The Verge). The film stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, and is due out in January 2017. 10.

Popular on WIRED Sushi-making robot creates artful snack using motorised arms – and even adds wasabi It can take Japanese chefs years to master how to make sushi, which is considered an art form as well as a nutritious meal. But now there’s a robot that can create a perfect plate of sushi, adding fish and wasabi to sticky rice, before presenting it professionally on a board in next to no time. The robotic chef, created by Kawasaki – the world’s largest manufacturer of automation robots – uses its arms to manipulate the food and is the latest in a line of mechanical foodies, including a pancake-flipping android and biscuit-dunking machine. Kawasaki adapted a double-arm Scara robot to make the unnamed sushi bot, which was put through its paces at its Kawasaki Robo stage showroom in Tokyo.

According to the company the quality of calls "adjusts" as the local network conditions change. When there's a low signal, or poor Wi-Fi connection, the video quality will be reduced. For those wanting to use the app, a Google account isn't needed. The firm says it works through a person's phone number and accessing contacts stored on a device. ADVERTISEMENT Read more Google is helping Full Fact create an automated, real-time fact-checker Google is helping Full Fact create an automated, real-time fact-checker By Matt Burgess Duo, Google says, has been built with privacy in mind. As such, all video calls made across the app are protected by end-to-end encryption – one of the mathematically stronger forms of cryptography. FaceTime is also encrypted in the same way. Google says: "For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call." ADVERTISEMENT One feature – Knock Knock – lets a person with the app "see live video of your caller before you answer". This is intended to show the recipient where the person is, and what they're doing, before you pick-up the call. The roll out of the app has started and Google says it will be available worldwide in the next few days. At the time of writing the app isn't showing in the UK's iOS store.

They elect husbands, wives, sons, and daughters. The First Family poses for an official portrait in the Oval Office in December of 2011. Pete Souza / The White House Most Popular 'Hail Trump!': White Nationalists Salute the President Elect Daniel Lombroso and Yoni Appelbaum Nov 21, 2016 The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck 7:00 AM ET The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart Nov 21, 2016 What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook 7:00 AM ET Megan Garber Aug 12, 2016 Politics Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size There is an argument that arises, presidential campaign after presidential campaign, in forms ranging from the sarcastic to the strident. It goes like this: Maybe the U.S. should have a prime minister. Maybe the U.S. should even have a king or queen. Maybe the presidency should be neatly bifurcated, the governmental duties on one side and the ceremonial on the other: a constitutional monarchy, basically, only without the crowns or the thrones or the subtle side-eye from the ghost of George Washington. The argument recurs, chafing though it may against most Americans’ conception of what their country is all about, because it is grounded in a broad truth: Americans ask a lot of their leaders. The presidency, at this point—an office that has been celebritized through the decades by the workings of mass media—is at once martial and executive and administrative and ceremonial. It demands that the person who carries the nuclear codes be the same person who pardons the turkeys. Exercising international diplomacy, throwing dinners, waging war, making memes, delivering soaring speeches, indulging in small talk on The Late Show, inspiring us, amusing us, consoling us, keeping us safe: All of these fall under the presidency’s ever-expanding job description. That makes the job an all-consuming endeavor—and it means that, regardless of his (and now, potentially, her) gender, the president has come to function as a kind of national host. If the country is an imagined community, the president is the person charged with welcoming Americans, day after day, into the national family. Triumphs and trials of women in leadership Read more That is perhaps why Americans have been, historically, so interested in politicians’ own, decidedly non-imaginary, families. Google recently provided The Atlantic with a selection of search data: a corpus of the terms associated with various politicians, across presidential, Senate, and House races. The idea was to give a proximate sense, via U.S. searches related to each person’s candidacy, of what people wanted to know about their would-be leaders. And one of the most common trends, across candidates and campaign years—and also across genders—was the searchers’ consistent interest in candidates’ families. The Google corpus suggests the same thing those periodic proposals of American monarchy do: American voters don’t simply put people into office. They put families there. * * * Let’s start with the 2016 presidential primary season (for Google-search purposes, the period of April of 2015 to March of 2016). The top 50 searches related to Marco Rubio include “marco rubio wife,” which came in as the fourth-most common related search. That was followed by “jeanette rubio” (16th) and “rubio wife” (32nd). Carly Fiorina’s related searches include “frank fiorina” (16th) and “carly fiorina husband” (27th). For Hillary Clinton, from January 2015 to the present, “bill clinton” has been the candidate’s 9th most common related search term—more popular than “hillary clinton vp,” “hillary clinton email,” and “hillary clinton benghazi.” Those spouse-specific searches echo the dynamics of the 2012 presidential campaign, in which Mitt Romney’s 21st most common search term was “ann romney,” with “mitt romney wife” coming in as the 47th. And that, in turn, echoed the dynamics of 2008. In that campaign, with its long and hard-fought primary season, Joe Biden’s most common related search terms included “joe biden wife” (11th) and “jill biden” (31st). Michele Bachmann’s popular terms included “michele bachmann husband” (4th), “marcus bachman” (18th), and “bachmann husband” (37th). Sarah Palin’s included “sarah palin affair” (31st)—ostensibly the public’s expression of curiosity about this—and “todd palin” (30th). The searches suggest a culturally holistic notion of political leadership: It takes a village to lead a country. Some of those searches, sure, might suggest simple prurience (“sarah palin affair”) on the part of the Americans who took to Google to convert curiosity into information. And there are reasons Bill’s name popped up in Hillary’s searches that have very little to do with voters’ attempts to assess the kind of president she would be. What’s most striking about the data, though, is the extent to which the spouse-related searches are made in relation to both men and women candidates. Rather than the regressive, if still common, framing of a woman’s achievements in terms of her husband—“good job, Carly, but what about Frank?”—the data suggest, overall, the public’s broader interest in candidates’ families, regardless of the candidates’ gender. So the searches in this case don’t necessarily suggest sexism. (Although “Hillary clinton nutcracker” is currently the Democratic nominee’s 35th-most common related-search term.) Rather, they suggest a culturally holistic notion of political leadership. It takes a village to lead a country. The Google data further dispel the idea of straightforward gender bias when it comes to searches surrounding recent congressional races. On the one hand, “mia love husband” and “jason love” come in at the Utah representative’s 3rd and 5th most-common related searches, respectively, and “steve schultz” is the number-one related search term for Florida’s Debbie Wasserman Schultz. But for many of those politicians’ fellow women, among them Senators Elizabeth Warren and Claire McCaskill and former Representative Gabby Giffords, their top 50 related searches feature no mention at all of husbands or spouses. (That is particularly surprising when it comes to Giffords, whose husband is the famous-in-his-own-right astronaut Mark Kelly. His absence among her searches could be attributed to people simply not realizing that they’re married—and, either way, that they have other things they want to know about her besides her marital status. Americans are not searching, in great numbers, for “gabby giffords husband.”) Curiosity about “family,” in particular, was a cross-gender phenomenon in the Google searches. In 2008, “joe biden family” was the then-primary candidate’s 17th most common search term; “Marco rubio family” was, during the Florida senator’s 2016 presidential run, his 24th most common related term. And children, too, have been common causes for curiosity, for both women and men candidates. “Bristol palin” was Sarah Palin’s second-most-common related search in 2008; “trig palin” was the 23rd, “sarah palin daughter” was the 27th, and “palin daughter” was the 39th. In 2012, “mitt romney sons” was the GOP nominee’s 24th most common search term. And in 2016, “carly fiorina daughter” was the GOP primary contender’s 10th-most-common related search during her run. “Lori ann fiorina”—the candidate’s stepdaughter, who died of a drug overdose in 2009 after a long battle with addiction—was the 20th, and “carly fiorina children” was the 31st. * * * Together, the data suggest what any political convention, and what a lot of political media coverage, will tend to take for granted: Politics is, whatever else it might be, a family game. That’s the reason candidates air TV ads that prominently highlight their loving husbands or wives or children. It’s the reason that Michelle Obama and Ivanka Trump stole the shows in Philadelphia and Cleveland last month. It’s the reason that executives at the state and national levels have come to office, carrying on a centuries-long tradition, with “first families” in tow. The New York Times recently mentioned, in an article about Bill Clinton’s plans for his potential foray into first gentlemanship, that the former president would not be engaging in activities like picking out White House china patterns and overseeing floral arrangements. Instead, the paper noted, some of those duties are “expected to fall to the Clintons’ daughter, Chelsea.” Dynasties, familial intrigue, tabloid fodder—politicians can provide those things. Americans want them to. This, rightfully, provoked ire. (Perhaps the Clinton White House could make things easier on everyone and just get Colin Cowie on retainer.) And yet, in the context of the family impulse in American politics, the turn-to-Chelsea assumption made some sense. The White House is, on top of everything else, a home; the first families is expected to shoulder the burdens of making that home. It’s a duty that reflects the president’s role not just as a political leader, but as a cultural one. The current president recently wrote an impassioned defense of feminism in the pages of Glamour. His wife recently starred, with Missy Elliott, in a Carpool Karaoke segment. The Obama daughters make headlines for everything from yawning to wearing clothing to talking to Ryan Reynolds to getting a summer job at a seafood shack. Which is another way of saying that Americans seem to sense the soft scent of royalty in first families—while never, of course, admitting to a taste for monarchy. Dynasties, familial intrigue, fodder for tabloids: Politicians can provide those things. Recent history would suggest that Americans want them to. Take the Google search data for President Obama: the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world, the man who makes decisions every day that directly affect the course of millions of human lives. Google’s most common related-search term for the president between January 2015 and today? “Malia obama.” The third most common, after “president obama”? “Sasha obama.” And then “michelle obama” (14th). And then “obama daughters” (16th). And then “malia obama college” (21st). At the moment, the 49th most common search term related to the 44th president of the United States is “natasha obama,” his youngest daughters given name. So deep, apparently, is the American public’s interest in the first family that some industrious Google searchers use a name not even the Obamas employ.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out.

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Carolyn Kaster / AP The Trump Takeover The Editors After a shocking upset, the president-elect and his party prepare for next year.

Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Shadow Brokers Allegedly Hack NSA's Equation Group Google Begins Development of Fuchsia Open-Source OS Salesforce Inbox to Include Calendar Feature for Smarter Scheduling Microsoft Shuttering Azure RemoteApp, Turns to Citrix       Today's topics include Shadow Broker's claim that it stole cyber-weapons stolen from the Equation Group, Google's new Fuchsia Open-Source operating system project, Salesforce's introduction of a new calendar feature for its Inbox app and Microsoft's partnership with Citrix to deliver the XenApp Express remote access application. On Aug. 13, a previously unknown group identifying itself only as the Shadow Brokers announced on Twitter that it was selling cyber-weapons it had allegedly stolen in a breach of a Equation Group server. The Equation Group is a shadowy group allegedly linked to the U.S National Security Agency, according to a 2015 report from security firm Kaspersky Lab. At this point, it's not entirely clear if there was a breach at the Equation Group or the NSA. Furthermore, neither the Equation Group nor the NSA is likely to make a public statement about its operations or whether they have been hit with a data breach. A spokesperson for Kaspersky Lab, which first publicized information about the Equation Group, told eWEEK that Kaspersky Lab doesn't have any information on the breach at this time, but the company's research team is investigating. Google has begun work on a brand-new open-source operating system called Fuchsia. From the few details that are publicly available about it on the GitHub code repository, Fuchsia will be completely different from Google's Android and Chrome operating systems. Fuchsia appears to be targeted at smartphones, high-end PCs featuring fast processors and large amounts of memory and internet of things devices. The biggest difference between Google's existing operating systems and Fuchsia is that the latter will not be based on the Linux kernel. It will instead use a new kernel called Magenta, which according to Google's description on GitHub, is the "core platform" powering the Fuchsia OS. Salesforce.com announced a significant new feature that it's added to its Inbox email app—a Calendar app that integrates with data stored on the company's CRM platform. The idea is to make sales reps more efficient, particularly on mobile devices, by giving them information on clients and prospects without having to launch a separate program. The news comes after an earlier Salesforce announcement about integration with Microsoft's popular Outlook email program. Salesforce Inbox is available for iOS and Android mobile devices. Azure RemoteApp, Microsoft's cloud-based remote application access service, is shutting down in 2017. Taking its place is a new collaboration between Microsoft and virtual desktop specialist Citrix called XenApp Express. The product, currently under development, "combines the simplicity of application remoting and the scalability of Azure with the security, management, and performance benefits of XenApp, to deliver Windows applications to any employee on any device," wrote Microsoft's Remote Desktop group in an Aug. 12 blog post. "We will have much more to share on this offering through the coming months." As a result, the company plans to shut down Azure RemoteApp in just over a year, on Aug. 31, 2017. Microsoft will stop taking orders for the service on Oct. 1.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

 Oracle wants another chance on its $9 billion trial with Google because Google kept a key 'secret' Matt Weinberger Aug. 17, 2016, 6:35 PM 15,402 facebook linkedin twitter email print Oracle founder Larry EllisonMichael Bradley/Getty Images) Back in May 2016, Google used its Google I/O developer extravaganza to announce that Android apps were going to appear on the search giant's low-cost Chromebook laptops.  Awesome, right? Well, database giant Oracle, which had that very same day rested its (ultimately unsuccessful) case in its $8.8 billion lawsuit against Google, definitely didn't think so, as Motherboard's Sarah Jeong reports, and now they're pushing for a do-over with a third trial. The key to Oracle's claim was that Google had violated copyright when it used key pieces of its Java technology to build Android, the most popular operating system in the world. But part of Google's winning defense was that Java is for computers, and Android is for smartphones and tablets, so there wasn't enough overlap to prove that Google was actually hurting Oracle's bottom line. The first trial had a hung jury on the issue of fair use; the second found in Google's favor. So when Google announced at Google I/O that it had been working in "secret" for "months" to put Android apps on Chromebooks, as Oracle's lawyers put it — meaning that Android was coming to computers after all — Oracle didn't like it much.  Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric SchmidtREUTERS/Beck Diefenbach “This was a shock to the industry and to us,” Oracle lawyer Annette Hurst reportedly told Judge William Alsup in court today.  Google's defense is that they did, indeed, inform Oracle of the plan to put Android apps on Chromebooks. A tool called ARC, or App Runtime for Chrome, created by Google, was a significant part of the expert testimony. As Jeong, a lawyer by training, points out, Oracle knew about this plan and chose not to do anything about it.  Still, Oracle is using this as grounds to push for a third trial, saying that Google didn't play fair by not bringing this new plan up in the course of the trial.  And, given that Android has expanded to cars, watches, and TVs in the years since this case was first brought in 2012, even Google's lawyer had to admit, under questioning from the judge, that Oracle currently has grounds to bring multiple new lawsuits along these same lines in the years to come. Oracle isn't giving up without a fight. Oracle and Google both declined to comment.

In time for the new year, Google Classroom is getting a bunch of new features, like annotations and email summaries for parents. Additionally, Expeditions has more virtual field trips and Forms finally supports adding images. Announced two years ago, Google Classroom features a suite of organization and management features for students and teachers alike. Today’s update adds the ability to annotate documents form within the app and thus allow students to work better. Teachers can use annotations to quickly grade work and highlight important sections in a reading or assignments. Parents and guardians will be better able to keep track of what their children are learning with a new email summary feature in Classroom. Automated daily or weekly emails provide summaries of student work and class announcements. Virtual reality still has a big content problem and Google aims to close the gap with over 200 Cardboard Expedition locations. With the app, teachers can lead students through a virtual field trip. New locations include the human body and a tour of the White House Kitchen Garden. Google has also announced that Expeditions is coming soon to iOS and will allow for virtual trips with iPads in full-screen mode instead of VR viewers. Minor updates today include the ability to upload images to questions and multiple choice answers in Google Forms. This particular update is available now to all Forms users.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Advertise 10 Keyword Tools You Need to Know Tools & Analytics July 13, 2016 Tools & Analytics Eli SchwartzJuly 13, 2016 1.7KSHARES 14.3KREADS 1.7KSHARES 14.3KREADS Eli Schwartz 1.7KSHARES 14.3KREADS For the past, present, and mostly likely the distant future, as a search marketer, keywords are your currency and language. Keywords are what drives the topics of the content you create, your PPC campaigns, and even peripherally the interests you target on social media. Access to a tool with keyword ideas and indicators of relative importance of one keyword over another is an absolute necessity.  With the recent news of Google blocking access to its Keyword Planner to anyone without an active account, it is prudent to be prepared with options in the event this restriction becomes the norm. Here are 10 alternatives to Google’s Keyword Planner for finding keyword ideas and search volume predictions. Ahrefs: Alongside Ahrefs’ backlink reporting and organic traffic dashboards, they have a really powerful keyword research tool which provides keyword ideas as well as search volume for all match types. For those conducting keyword research for SEO, Ahrefs has a keyword difficulty score metric which recently in head to head testing was declared to be slightly more accurate than other tools that offer a similar feature. Ahrefs is a paid tool, but if you sign up for a free trial and then cancel, you will maintain access to a free version of their tool. SEMRush: SEMRush has a keyword tool that is driven by its huge dataset of search data from 26 different countries. SEMRush results return keyword ideas, estimated search volume, estimated cpc, keyword difficulty score, and current ranking domains for a keyword. Moz: Moz recently launched their own dedicated keyword explorer as a supplement to their SEO research suite. You can choose from nearly any location in the globe to conduct your search and  filtering options allow you to exclude your specific query term to get more ideas, or even choose only question phrases that contain your keyword. Keyword results include related query ideas alongside estimated search volume and a keyword difficulty score. Moz also shows domains currently ranking for the keyword and recent mentions of the keyword. Keywordtool.io: This tool scrapes keyword suggest ideas from Google, YouTube, Bing, and even Amazon. You can choose suggested keywords from every Google TLD, language, and location and there are similar options for the other engines it supports. For free, you will get hundreds of suggested keywords, but you need a paid plan to access search volume estimations. Scrapebox: Mostly known as a black hat SEO tool, Scrapebox has plenty of white hat uses too (see this great guide from Neil Patel) including conducting keyword research. With Scrapebox, a small handful of keywords will easily turn into hundreds and even thousands of possibilities. Scrapebox is software that needs to run on a Windows desktop environment, but the upside is that it’s a one-time purchase vs a monthly or annual subscription. Wordstream: Primarily a paid tool to help search marketers manage their pay per click campaigns, Wordstream has a free keyword tool which allows a limited number of searches. Free results only include related keywords, but Wordstream’s paid subscribers can see search volume, too. Bing: While not the obvious choice if you are conducting research for Google campaigns, Bing’s keyword tool can still provide helpful insights on related keywords. You need to have a website verified in Bing’s Webmaster Tools in order to use the tool, but it is otherwise free to use.  The keyword ideas are not as broad as those that you might get from other free keyword tools; however, one advantage in Bing’s favor is that they display both broad and exact match search volume. Keyword Discovery: This is one of the oldest keyword tools in existence and they pull search data from the widest list of search resources. While I have found, at times, their predicted search volumes vary widely from what Google shows, this is a very useful tool for discovering ideas you might never have otherwise found. Its a paid tool, but you can conduct a limited amount of free searches. KWFinder: Keyword searches can be focused in five different countries or most of the world’s most popular languages. Results include a keyword difficulty score and keyword ideas can be filtered by a number of different metrics. This is a paid tool, so you can only conduct a limited amount of searches for free. 7Search: 7search.com was one of the world’s first PPC networks; although, you may not have met someone who’s ever used it. Their keyword tool is really simple to use and its free. Results include keyword ideas as well as search volume on the 7Search network. Even if Google maintains its non-advertising requirement status quo to use Keyword Planner, it’s still helpful to use some of the tools above when conducting keyword research just to get another perspective. Global Options Additionally, if you are conducting SEO or SEM campaigns in places around the world where Google faces actual competition—such as in Asia—you might be better off using keyword tools created for that local market. Baidu: The largest search engine in China has a free keyword tool as a part of its webmaster tools as well as a Google Trends-like product that gives hot trends and related keywords. You can also use DragonMetrics for keyword research (paid tool with a free trial) which is like a an Ahrefs/SEMRush/Moz for Baidu. ADVERTISEMENT Naver: The dominant search engine of Korea has a keyword tool to find popular keywords on its network. (Note: Naver’s tools work best on Internet Explorer) Yahoo Japan and Yahoo Taiwan: These are the leading search engines in their respective markets and they each have their own keyword tools (both behind login walls). Their keyword data should be the same as what Google shows since they use Google’s organic results. Yandex: The leading search engine in Russia and also very popular in Russian-speaking countries. Their keyword tool has Russian as well as English data.   If you are looking for a guide on how to do keyword research, check out the linked chapter of our SEO guide.  Image Credits Featured Image: Screenshot by Elis Schwartz.

Google Can Help Have Questions About Voting? Google Can Help By Angela Moscaritolo August 17, 2016 11:34am EST 10 Comments Just Google "how to vote" and the Web giant will hit you with all kinds of information. With November quickly approaching, Google wants to make sure you're election ready. The Web giant on Tuesday launched a new state-by-state guide for those looking for information about how to vote in the US presidential election this fall. "Whether you're a first-time voter, a resident in a new state, or your state laws have changed since the last time you voted, you can now come to Google for information on how to vote in the upcoming election," Google Search Product Manager Emily Moxley wrote in a blog post. Need help? Just Google "how to vote" and the Web giant will hit you with information on ID requirements, deadlines, mail-in ballots, and early voting — all customized to your state. "We hope this customized state-by-state guide will help you find the information you need quickly and easily to help get your voice heard," Moxley wrote. //Related Articles How to Register to Vote Online The new guide comes after Google last month introduced a tool to help demistify the voter registration process. Since then, "millions" of people have used the tool, Moxley wrote, and nationwide searches for voter registration are up 190 percent compared to four years ago, with the highest spikes occurring in California, New York, West Virginia, Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts. Now, Google is also making the data that powers its "how to register to vote" and "how to vote" search results publicly available, so nonprofits and other voter education organizations can use it. "We're committed to making it easy for people to find information, and have their voices heard in November," Moxley wrote. "We hope these insights and features inspire you to register to vote, exercise your civic duty, and get to the polls in November!"

One more fine may be imposed on Google if the corporation fails to meet the directive of the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) to cure violations of antimonopoly laws, FAS said on Wednesday. "Google has eight days to perform FAS directive from the time of court judgment preparation in full scope. Otherwise they will face a new penalty," press service of the regulator said.

"The court upheld the decision of the court of original jurisdiction," Head of FAS Department for Regulation of Communications and Information Technologies Elena Zaeva told journalists. "We are certainly pleased that the court upheld the judgment in favor of FAS. Soon as it enters into force, and we hope that in the near future, Google will perform the issued order in full," Zaeva said. At the same time, FAS will enforce Google ruling. "We expect to see the situation favorable for the development of competition in the market, it is the most important thing," she added, saying that Google has not yet paid the fine. Yandex, witness in the case, also expressed support for the court's decision.

Image: Oracle/Flickr Oracle Says Google Didn’t Play Fair, Wants Third Trial (Oh God) Written by Sarah Jeong Contributing Editor August 17, 2016 // 04:27 PM EST Copy This URL Oracle is definitely not mad about losing in Oracle v. Google (again). The multibillion dollar corporation is definitely not beet red and nude right now, and actually, it finds all of this funny. The company asked for (and lost out on) a $9 billion judgment against Google for allegedly infringing on Java Standard Edition when it created Android. This was the second trial in a six-year-long case that has already gone up to a court of appeals and back down again. Oracle is expected to appeal again. Meanwhile, Oracle showed up in court on Wednesday to ask for a new trial. It's easy to say that it’s just out of bitterness, but truthfully, Google did something really bizarre during the trial and now it’s coming back to bite the company. While highly-paid attorneys in a courthouse in San Francisco were busy waving their arms and pointing at illustrative file cabinets, their client was over in Mountain View hosting Google I/O, a giant trade conference for developers. Even as a massive copyright trial over Android (every version up to Marshmallow) loomed over the industry, Google went ahead and announced the next version of Android—Android Nougat. Oracle isn’t mad about Android Nougat, or at least, today wasn’t the day to get mad about it in a court of law. It’s mad because Google announced that Google Play was coming to Chrome OS. In other words: Android apps could now run on Chromebooks. Seriously, Google announced a brand spanking new maybe-infringement at I/O while it was still unsure over whether the last one was going to cost it $9 billion. Why does this matter? At the same time Google announced that Android was coming to laptops, Google lawyers at the Oracle trial were off arguing that Android never harmed the market for Java Standard Edition because Android is for smartphones and tablets, and not desktops and laptops. LOL. Here’s the thing: Oracle’s argument hinges on Google’s supposed failure to produce documents relating to the Google Play on Chrome OS announcement. Oracle says that Google was working on this project for “months” in “secret,” and that the company hid this from discovery. Google’s lawyers claim that they did indeed produce those documents: they told Oracle all about a project known as “ARC”—App Runtime for Chrome. And actually, one of Oracle’s expert witnesses devoted seventeen paragraphs to ARC in his report. Oracle knew all about these developments, and just decided not to bring it up at trial. ARC does basically what it says it does: it lets you run Android apps on Chrome OS. But it wasn’t very good, and at I/O, they announced… something new? Here’s what Ars Technica had to say about it back in May: The real shocker here is that this release of Google Play on Chrome OS is not based on ARC. Zelidrag Hornung, the engineering director of Chrome & Android, filled us in on the details: "We have redone this completely differently. There are no connecting points between the two projects (ARC and today's announcement) from an implementation perspective." ARC wasn't good enough, so Google started over from scratch. “This was a shock to the industry and to us,” said Oracle attorney Annette Hurst to Judge William Alsup. “Ars Technica, the premiere publication in this industry, called it a shocker. A shocker.” “For the record @Oracle, I called Android on Chrome OS ‘a shocker’ because the underpinnings weren't what I expected,” Ron Amadeo, the author of that article, tweeted today. Hurst argued that when Google’s expert witnesses said that Android was for phones and tablets, rather than desktop (like Java Standard Edition), they lied. “They were perpetrating a fraud on the jury!” she said in court. Is ARC all that different from Google Play on Chrome OS? Maybe? Is ARC so different that Oracle is entitled to a new trial? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The really weird thing that’s going on here is that in the four years since the first trial in 2012 (which resulted in a hung jury with respect to the fair use issue—hence the second trial), Google has been up to all kind of stuff. There’s Android TV. There’s Android Wear. There’s Android Auto. Perhaps because he was faced with the very grim prospect of explaining Java and application programming interfaces to a jury of laypeople, the judge excluded all of these later devices, and told the parties to limit themselves to phones and tablets from 2012. But the trial was about versions of Android all the way to Marshmallow, which was released in September 2015. The whole thing is very awkward! It’s so awkward that when Judge Alsup asked Google attorney Christa Anderson if Oracle was entitled to sue over Android TV, Android Wear, Android Auto, Google Play on Chrome OS and so forth, she readily said that yes, they were. Unless something changed on appeal, of course. Oracle wouldn’t just be able to sue over these inventions, it could also sue over Android Nougat. This newest version supports Java 8—and in making that support possible, Google probably reimplemented a bunch of the very same API packages that they were being sued over. Seriously, the company announced a brand spanking new maybe-infringement at I/O while it was still unsure over whether the last one was going to cost it $9 billion. All of this might seem like a huge headache, but it gets even more ridiculous. Oracle isn’t the only one dragging its feet post-trial. Google has filed for a finding of civil contempt and sanctions against Oracle, and is also asking for $3.9 million in costs. Oracle only wants to give its opponent about $975,334.32. This is all trial-related costs for things like photocopies and court-appointed experts. We can only speculate as to how much the lawyers and their own actual expert witnesses cost both sides. From a filing made by Google. Oracle and Google might be really mad, but the maddest one of them all is Judge Alsup, who is clearly sick of everyone and would very much like for this case to leave his courtroom forever. “Do you know how many Social Security claimants I can't rule on right now because you're arguing over a costs bill?” he snapped at Google’s attorneys. But it’s not over yet: they’re all back in court on September 22nd, for the hearing on contempt and sanctions.

But prices are dropping, and external drives with deep storage are fast becoming something we all want on our desktops or in a travel bag. Samsung’s T3 SSD lineup is perhaps the best known of the bunch. We put the 2TB USB-C offering through its paces, comparing it to cloud storage as well as spinning drives. It’s small TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat The first thing that jumps out is how tight the package on this 2TB model is. Compared to the Porsche Design drive I recently tested, it’s downright dwarfish. That size is possible because SSD has no moving parts; it doesn’t need to spin, and creates very little heat while operating. Every bit of this drive is storage. While it’s nowhere near as pretty as the Porsche Design drive, the size more than makes up for that. Faster than a Porsche (or moving clouds) Speed kills, and the T3 simply murders anything comparable. It’s roughly twice as fas as the spinning Porsche drive, and typically about five times as fast as cloud storage on a Wi-Fi connection hovering around 15Mbps for uploads. Those gains are for simpler transfers — something most users will run into, like moving 10-20 files around at a time. When you start moving huge folders, the T3 shines. I cached my entire Google Drive (about 50GB data) to shuffle it around from my computer’s hard drive to an external source. The T3 completed the transfer in about 45 seconds. The Porsche drive took about five minutes (not bad), and cloud storage took roughly 10 minutes (I tested with iCloud and Google Drive). Cables matter I tested the 2TB T3 with a 2013 MacBook Pro and 2016 MacBook. The drive comes with a USB to USB-C cable, which is adequate for file transfer. If you want to use it with a MacBook, Apple’s included cable won’t help you much. It’s not meant for high speed file transfers. I purchased an Aukey USB-C cable for about $12 on Amazon, and that fixed the speed issues I was having with Apple’s cable. For the price, Aukey’s nylon-wrapped cable is a worthwhile upgrade from Apple’s standard white offering — especially if you want to use any sort of external drive like the T3. You get what you pay for For 2TB, you’ll pay about $730 for the T3. That’s a lot of cash. The Porsche drive will run you $160, and it’s easy to find similar drives even cheaper. Spinning drives are seeing the end of days for consumers. The upside is that if they fail, data recovery is typically much easier than it is with SSDs. And the argument for cloud storage data safety trumps both arguments. The trouble with the cloud is that it typically requires a subscription unless you want to keep data spread out all over the Web by using the 5 to 15GB free tiers available just about everywhere. For consumers, 1TB is likely enough storage — and the best price you’ll find from a reputable provider like Google or Apple is $10 per month. Apple tops out at 1TB. Google scales up to 10TB, and the pricing matches that scale at $100 per month. Tucking information into the cloud is almost inarguably the easiest method, but if you plan on having a large backup for a few years or more, finding a good external drive is probably more cost effective. I was using iCloud to store files I accessed across multiple desktops, and it was getting bulky — handy, but crowded. In offloading much of the larger files and stuff that I wasn’t going to access any time soon onto the T3, I was able to reduce how much I spent on cloud storage. SSD is better (sometimes) For desktop users, I’d say the T3 is a no-brainer. It’s fast, transfers a ton of files quickly (with the right cable) and is highly portable. It’s also worth the spend if your new MacBook came with a small amount of internal storage. It doesn’t replace the cloud for every purpose, though. As a macOS and iOS user, Photos and Notes are two apps I rely on — and both need iCloud. I can’t get away from spending a few bucks monthly on iCloud for that reason, but I can put a glass ceiling on my spending by managing my data every few months. I don’t need to keep large Xcode builds or wireframes for apps in the cloud, and storing legacy personal files I won’t access makes no sense for the cloud, either. And with the 2016 MacBook Pro likely carrying USB-C, cables matter — and finding a good USB-C to micro USB-3 (the standard most modern external drives use) cable won’t be easy. I like the T3’s portability, which was a big reason I began using it to better manage my cloud storage. I often take my MacBook and work remotely, but don’t want to carry around a large spinning drive in the off chance I’ll need a file. The SSD fits in a pocket. It’s spendy, and that’s maybe it’s only downside. As time goes on, SSD pricing will drop, but I still prefer accessing files on the T3 to any other method so it’ll stay in my bag (and on my desk).

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Oracle says trial wasn’t fair, it should have known about Google Play for Chrome "They're lying to the jury! The court can't countenance this." by Joe Mullin - Aug 17, 2016 7:20 pm UTC Login to bookmark 280 Peter Kaminski / flickr SAN FRANCISCO—Oracle lawyers argued in federal court today that their copyright trial loss against Google should be thrown out because they were denied key evidence in discovery. Oracle attorney Annette Hurst said that the launch of Google Play on Chrome OS, which happened in the middle of the trial, showed that Google was trying to break into the market for Java SE on desktops. In her view, that move dramatically changes the amount of market harm that Oracle experienced, and the evidence should have been shared with the jury. "This is a game-changer," Hurst told US District Judge William Alsup, who oversaw the trial. "The whole foundation for their case is gone. [Android] isn't 'transformative'; it's on desktops and laptops." Google argued that its use of Java APIs was "fair use" for several reasons, including the fact that Android, which was built for smartphones, didn't compete with Java SE, which is used on desktops and laptops. During the post-trial hearing today, Hurst argued that it's clear that Google intends to use Android smartphones as a "leading wedge" and has plans to "suck in the entire Java SE market." "Android is doing this using Java code," said Hurst. "That's outrageous, under copyright law. This verdict is tainted by the jury’s inability to hear this evidence. Viewing the smartphone in isolation is a Google-gerrymandered story." Google attorney Christa Anderson responded that Oracle asked for, and received, information about App Runtime for Chrome, or ARC, during discovery. Oracle knew that Google was trying to port Android apps over to laptops, and if it wanted to use that argument during trial, it could have, she said. "No party had a duty to supplement discovery with matters beyond the scope of trial," said Anderson. "Our answers were appropriate and complete." Google was considering an update to ARC, internally called ARC++. But that wasn't available when Google was answering discovery questions back in October. "It's right now in a sort of Beta release phase," said Anderson. "It was not developed, and ready to roll, during the discovery period." Alsup asked Hurst why Oracle couldn't just file a new lawsuit if it believed that Chrome desktops were infringing copyright and not protected by fair use. Hurst replied that she could do that, but it didn't change the fact that the just-concluded trial was "infected and tainted" by this issue. "Google's whole pitch was 'We didn’t harm Java SE because we weren’t on desktops and laptops.' This jury was entitled to consider the context—yes, now they are on desktops and laptops. It's outrageous. They're lying to the jury! The court can't countenance this!" Hurst said. Hurst referred to an Ars Technica review of Google Play for Chrome, published May 19, which posited that the "real shocker" about Google's new system was that it wasn't based on ARC. "Ars Technica, the premier publication in this industry, called it a 'shocker,'" he said. "There was no such platform available during the discovery period," responded Anderson. Alsup is going to take it under submission and will rule later in writing. But he did leave Anderson with these words: "If I had been in your position, I would have disclosed." Evidence and costs While the accusations over desktops and laptops dominated the hearing today, Alsup also addressed two other matters. One was Oracle's motion for a new trial, which simply argued that Google presented so little evidence during the trial to support its case that Oracle should win, notwithstanding the jury verdict. Oracle attorney Nathan Shaffer argued that Google was knowingly making a "market replacement" for Java-based phones, and that isn't covered by fair use. "They copied [the APIs] because they wanted to capture developers," he said. Alsup was unimpressed by that argument. "Don’t we let the jury decide this?" he asked. "You had all those e-mails. A jury certainly could have found your way if a jury wanted to. But the other side put in evidence the other way. Bad faith, or good faith? Isn't that the most classic jury question imaginable?" "It would be a jury question if there was evidence to support good faith—" Shaffer began. "There was—of course there was," Alsup said. "You can’t just put on blinders and say the other side didn’t put on a case. "Take Mr. [Jonathan] Schwartz. [Oracle attorney Peter] Bicks tried to rake him over the coals. I thought he did a pretty good cross-exam. But the jury can say, 'We like Jonathan Schwartz. We didn't like that cross-examination. Too bad, Oracle loses.' That's the way it works in trials." Later, it was Google's turn on the hot seat when the two sides argued over the $3.9 million bill of legal costs that Google wants Oracle to pay. "We’re arguing over a cost bill," said Alsup as two different attorneys sidled up to the podiums to argue the matter. "Do you know how many Social Security claimants I can’t rule on, while I’m ruling on your cost bill? Why can’t you resolve this on your own?" Google lawyer Reid Mullen pointed out that technically, it was Oracle's objections to the bill of costs that caused the hearing. "Can I go through your cost bill and deny the entire thing?" Alsup asked Mullen. "Because I think you're being greedy and asking for too much. Maybe I should just deny it based on greed. I’ve done that in other cases." "Your Honor, we stand by the cost bill," he said. "These are discovery costs, authorized by the 9th Circuit." Alsup told the two sides to get together and see if they can't work it out. Google's $3.9 million cost bill includes only things like document production and court-ordered experts; it doesn't include the far more costly parts of litigation, which include lawyers' fees and their own experts. "Go through these line items and reach an agreement," said Alsup. "Failing that, I may deny everything you want, because of greed and overreaching." Oracle originally sued Google in 2010, saying the company violated copyrights related to application programming interfaces (APIs) in the Java programming language. After a first jury trial in 2012, Alsup found that APIs aren't subject to copyright at all, but that ruling was overturned on appeal. The dispute went to a second jury trial in May of this year, after which the jury found that Google's use of Java APIs didn't violate copyright law because it was "fair use." Oracle has said it will appeal that verdict. Expand full story Reader comments 280 You must login or create an account to comment.

After years of research, the chipmaker has begun selling a product using a technology called silicon photonics that builds lasers directly into computer chips. That means communications can take place using light traveling over glass fiber-optic cables that can carry much more data than electrons on traditional copper wires. "We see a future where silicon photonics optical input-output is everywhere in the data center," said Diane Bryant, general manager of Intel's Data Center Group, at the company's Intel Developer Forum Wednesday in San Francisco. More from IDF 2016 USB Type-C could kill your headphone jack. Here's how ​Intel's next-gen PC chip works, it's the fastest ever, and it's coming this fall Intel strikes deal to make ARM-based chips It's not technology you'll plug into your PC or phone any time soon, but silicon photonics could help you out. That's because data centers packed with thousands of servers are shouldering more and more work -- everything from Facebook's face recognition to Google's language translation. Opening up communication bottlenecks between those servers means new services are economical and existing ones can run faster. Intel's first silicon photonics communication chips can transfer data at 100 gigabits per second -- roughly 100 times faster than home Wi-Fi under the most optimistic circumstances. A next-generation version will quadruple that to 400Gbps, Intel said. Enlarge Image Intel's silicon photonics communciation modulePhoto by Intel Servers' data appetite has been growing explosively, said Kushagra Vaid, general manager of cloud hardware engineering for Microsoft's widely used Azure server infrastructure. Copper cables already struggle to hit 25Gbps with lengths just 10 feet long, he said, but silicon photonics could help the company scale to the next level. "When we get to 100 gigabits per second, we're going to hit a brick wall," Vaid said. "That's where silicon photonics is very interesting. It's a great way for us to continue that scaling." Fiber optics are widely used for long-haul communication links like undersea cables. Intel and other photonics fans expect integrating laser communications into chips will lower costs for the technology so it can be used for shorter distances within data centers and eventually inside a computer chassis. Intel's new module can send signals as far as 1.2 miles -- an immense improvement over copper cabling. Intel isn't alone in the market. IBM, Luxtera, Fujitsu and Silicon Valley startups are working on silicon photonics, too.

Google will provide a summary box detailing state voting laws at the top of the search results whenever a user appears to be looking for that information. The breakdown will focus on the rules particular to the state where the search request originates unless a user asks for another location. Google is introducing the how-to-vote instructions a month after it unveiled a similar feature that explains how to register to vote in states across the U.S. The search giant said its campaign is driven by rabid public interest in the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. As of last week, it said, the volume of search requests tied to the election, the candidates and key campaign issues had more than quadrupled compared to a similar point in the 2012 presidential race. It’s difficult to predict whether Google’s efforts will have a major impact on how many people cast ballots, says Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who closely studies election turnout. That’s because Google will narrowly target its voting instructions to people who are actively seeking that information. Sample requests that will elicit a helping hand from Google include “what do I need to vote,” ”when can I vote,” ”what is the absentee ballot deadline” and “can I vote by mail.” The summary boxes won’t appear for broader requests pertaining to the election, such as “Clinton” or “Trump.” That means Google may primarily end up helping out “politically engaged” people who’d be likely to cast a November ballot even without prodding from the world’s most popular search engine. “It’s an open question on how large the positive effect will be,” McDonald said. Google will also release its registration and voting guides to nonprofit groups and other organizations aiming to get more people to the polls this November. The company said it considers its voting tools to be a nonpartisan public service, although swings in voter turnout have swayed past elections. McDonald, though, says it is always difficult to predict which candidate in an election stands to gain the most from an increase in voter turnout. As an example, he suggests, Google’s effort could easily help increase the number of younger people more inclined to vote for Clinton – or put more ballots in the hands of less educated, disillusioned citizens backing Trump.

Dubai Internet City Home to everyone from Google to the next big thing: Inside the Middle East's largest ICT hub Established in 2000, Dubai Internet City has become the most significant IT hub in the region. So what's changed in the past fifteen years and what are the plans for its future? Read More Launched in January, the venue is Google's first Brazilian Campus. A mix of coworking space, new venture accelerator and networking center, the place also offers courses and seminars to those interested in the digital startup scene. The selected start-ups are working on projects ranging from microcredit and sign language translation to automation tools for investments in the stock exchange and mobile gaming. The companies will be working at the Google Campus for six months -- during that time, they will get access to mentoring and immersions led by Google executives. Google won't be investing any capital in the start-ups taking part in the Campus program. The startups also don't pay to participate. The company will be launching a second selection process for Brazilian start-ups soon. Other Campuses are located in London, Madrid, Seoul, Warsaw, and Tel Aviv. The latter campus has produced start-ups such as Waze, which ended up getting bought by Google. According to the web giant, companies created within its Campuses have generated over 5,000 jobs.

Obviously, a company as large as Google, which has a hand in countless aspects of the technology arena across the globe, is more likely to be the target of lawsuits simply because of its involvement there. That’s the easy explanation, but is there something more? Don’t Be Evil From early 2000 to late 2015 (when Google officially became Alphabet), the company’s corporate motto was simple: Don’t be evil. 8 Retail Stocks That Will Make You Richer Now, there are sure to be hoards of people who will — quite vehemently no doubt — argue that Google is evil, and cite evidence to defend that claim. But, if you were to exclude all the people who claim Google is evil simply because they didn’t get what they wanted from a product or service, or didn’t receive customer support that was as comprehensive as they wanted, or those people who are just plain crazy, what would you really have left? How many viable, plausible instances could there be where evidence exists demonstrating that Google acted with blatant malicious intent to harm a person? You know … actual evil. Personally, I don’t think Google is evil. I’m not saying the company has never behaved in a manner that’s morally questionable, or never made decisions that (in hindsight) were probably not the wisest choices. But, overall as a corporation, Google has demonstrated significantly more benevolence than malevolence. GOOGL Is Not Big Brother I think there’s a semi-unconscious global social resistance to, and fear of, extremely large corporations, particularly those that handle personal information. Think of George Orwell’s 1984 in modern times, or the movie Equilibrium with Christian Bale. People are, quite understandably, frightened of companies or organizations that possess enormous amounts of confidential data. In today’s day and age, Google is equated with Big Brother, a metaphor strengthened by discoveries of Google’s interactions with our own government’s secret agencies. While Orwellian scenarios are perhaps a bit extreme, I think they accurately represent society’s innate distrust and apprehension. Just think about it — in a worst-case scenario, 50 years from now Google could be the world’s Big Brother equivalent. Even though there’s no indisputable evidence suggesting that such intentions exist, the mere possibility is frightening to the average person. Couple that with the Snowden-esque whistleblowers and WikiLeaks reveals showing how our government, and others, has been invading citizens’ privacy, it’s only natural for people to want to limit the power of companies like Google. Surviving Within a Society Built on Distrust We, as Americans, enjoy a plethora of civil liberties that citizens in many other countries cannot. Some Asian and Middle Eastern nations are prime examples of limited freedoms, as government oversight has a stranglehold on the populace. Consider the socio-cultural history of those regions and their track record of extreme censorship and information control. For example, Chinese and North Korean people have been suffering under the stifling grip of absurdly tyrannical leadership determined to maintain total control over the dissemination of information. Companies like Google have endeavored to increase freedom of, and access to, information across the globe, which is why there’s such a firm resistance from the governments of those Asian nations. Google represents freedom, education and independent opinions, which is completely opposite what the leadership there wants. Target Corporation (TGT) Clubbed on Another Sickly Quarter This, specifically, is why Google is perceived as dangerous, and is the basis for blocking or restricting access in those parts of the world. Leaders there continually target GOOGL because the company’s American values are ingrained into its products and services, and those values must not be allowed to reach the general public for fear of inciting anti-government sentiment. As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Executives spend an estimated half of their days in meetings and other employees while away three hours a day in meetings.  One of the biggest hassles with meetings is actually setting the meeting up, with multiple emails flooding inboxes deciding who could meet, what the meeting is about, and forget about trying to pin down one time when everyone can attend. But what if there was a better way? Scheduling Tools for Meetings A large number of tools aim to solve the issue of booking meetings — over 200 to be precise. I broke down this list by major function into four main categories: Publish and subscribe tools (Doodle is a good example), Added functionality to your calendar tools (i.e. Outlook or Google Calendar),  Resource management tools (meeting rooms, employees, etc.) and Smart meeting tools. For the purposes of this post, we will go quickly through the first three categories and then focus on the fourth category, which I find the most interesting. Publish and Subscribe Tools With Doodle, users publish a list of available meeting times to so other people involved in the meeting can pick the time(s) that work best for them.  The example to the right shows March 29 at 11:00 am works for everyone, so the meeting is set for that time.  What happens when none of the times you've published works for everyone? Remember, this meeting had only three people. For every person added to the meeting, the chances of finding a common meeting time goes down exponentially.  One person I spoke with told me that “getting a meeting set between 12 board members of a non-profit was close to an impossible situation, and you just had to find the date the most could attend and hope for the best.” Another big problem arises when stakeholders hold meetings hostage. In other words, the whole meeting is waiting for one late stakeholder, and you can’t start without them (I often do).  But getting people to show up to a meeting is another problem, and probably a whole different article. Other tools that fit into this category include: Gathergrid, Microsoft Invite, Pick, Vyte. Calender Add-on Tools A number of tools look to use the rich data available in your calendar to help set up meetings. The two main calendar programs are Microsoft Outlook/Exchange and Google Calendar.  Applications like Boomerang Calendar, Meeting Planner, TimeBridge and Calendly all use data found in personal calendars to start the process of setting up a meeting. But unfortunately, from there on it often follows the publishing model above or devolves into the back and forth emails that we all know and loathe.  TimeBridge Meet-with-Me in action This might help to a certain extent, but almost all of these tools use email for notification and discussion — not the most reliable or best option by any means.  Resource Management Tools This class of tools looks at the most productive use of assets (people, time, meeting rooms, equipment, etc.). In many companies meeting rooms are at a premium, and booking one can be a major hassle.  A host of tools aimed at the enterprise deal with this, including Concierge Booking, Condeco, Meeting Room Manager, Resource Central, Room Manager and more. Many of these tools come equipped with Microsoft Outlook/Exchange integrations, and a number of them, like Condeco seen to the right, offer a mobile app that allows you to book rooms from your phone. This group of tools also approaches meeting rooms from a facilities and resource perspective. For example Schedule It is a resource and task scheduling tool for staff, office equipment, meeting rooms, events and expenses tracking in project planning.  Foxoms helps schedule facilities, staff and equipment. Resource Central allows you to look for suitable meeting rooms across several physical sites, and works with the Microsoft tool set (Outlook/Exchange, Office 365, etc.) to do this. Resource Guru does much the same thing. Other tools, like RoomManager, allow you to book vehicles and parking spaces as well as rooms and AV equipment. Many of these tools, like Roomzilla, will use a website or internal web page to show meeting room status. An Alternative Approach: The Process Approach Before we move on to smart tools, let's look at tools that look at the meeting as a process, offering ways to make that process more effective without reinventing the wheel. The best example here is Lucid Meetings, which takes a comprehensive and thoughtful approach to meetings and all their itinerant problems.   The Lucid Meeting Pyramid below shows booking meetings as the lowest step of the pyramid (“Coordination”). While addressing scheduling, Lucid Meetings incorporates multiple tools to offer a comprehensive solution to the meeting challenges represented in every step of the pyramid. Lucid breaks the meeting up into three time-bound sections: planning the meeting, executing the meeting, and following through on the meeting. For example: here is what they do to help with scheduling and invitations. Lucid Meetings Pyramid of Services Lucid’s more holistic approach uses a scheduling poll similar to Doodle's, but also translates meeting times into each person’s time zone, and sends out a professional looking meeting invite email. It also makes sure that people get the meeting on their calendar, sends meeting reminders, and saves contacts for future meeting invites. Instead of trying to provide all solutions, Lucid integrates with a wide variety of other tools that also help with meetings including: Box, Dropbox, Glance, Basecamp, Confluence, Harvest, TurboBridge, Skype, Google hangouts, as well as calendar integrations with Microsoft Outlook and Google Calendar. Lucid Meeting's process-based approach to meetings, which deals with all of the problem entailed (before, during and after) is one of the more comprehensive meeting solutions I found in my research. Smart Meeting Tools The newest group of tools rides the wave of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning bots and personal assistant technologies that have rapidly advanced over the last two years. Some good examples of this type of tool include: Skejul (Private Beta), Aurora, WizCal and x.ai (Amy). All of these new tools have their challenges. Hello to the Personal Assistant Bots: Amy and Clara Everyone is familiar with Apple’s Siri, and Microsoft’s Cortona, but have you had Amy help you schedule a meeting?  Amy is the personal assistant from x.ai that helps schedule meetings and other mundane tasks. She is the only smart meeting tool in this review that has a conversational interface. But Amy is a bot, a smart chat bot, although some of the smarts still appear to be human. X.ai “trainers verify the vast majority of information in emails so the system can improve."  In other words, x.ai employees train Amy for greater accuracy by verifying that phrases are tagged correctly.  Clara, another bot scheduler also relies on some human interaction to help it. This area is called “human–assisted AI” and is a step on the way to having a robot personality schedule your meetings. Clara, like most of the tools covered in this review, uses email as the messaging and notification platform, and also as a data source.  While this area is rapidly advancing, these tools are basically statistical pattern matching tools being used to predict the best time for a meeting for all of those involved. Although some of them have sophisticated algorithms, a big issue is context and if they can get it right. That’s where the “human assist” comes in.  Often these tools are emulating the same process you would go through with email, but they are representing you, so you don’t have to spend the time (as the meeting owner/initiator), but often times, the other meeting members do. Amy, like a savant child, can do brilliant things, but also makes simple mistakes. Other companies have similar, yet different, approaches to this problem. Privacy Protectors: Skejul and WizCal Skejul, which is just coming out of beta (production in the fourth quarter), is a bit more consumer-oriented than WizCal, which is more team- and enterprise-oriented. Both Skejul and WizCal are very concerned with privacy and security.  Skejul works for individuals, families and larger groups (also more consumer-oriented) and only allows you to see specific information about the meeting. In other words, you only see what you need to, and everything else is kept private. WizCal also works in the background, so once you click their button in Outlook, name your meeting and include the participants, it does the rest, and keeps all the information private, except for what you need for the meeting. The Skejul interface is based on cards, which contain all of the information for a meeting, and can even be shrunk to a button and placed on a website. This card interface is very focused on the person (which is the center of the Skejul universe) but also can act like a team space where you add multimedia items, documents and even the agenda to the card. Skejul also has a strong API, so expect to see future integrations as it comes out of beta. The Final Option: Don't Book Meetings While scheduling meetings may seem like a small problem, it's a persistent one that robs productivity gains made from the use of other collaboration tools.  Look at it this way: with an average burdened cost of management at $200 an hour and burdened employees at $100 an hour, with an average of four people in a one hour meeting in an organization with 500 employees and 20 management, if these tools can save you 4 minutes per meeting, that could allow the organization to save over $80,000 a week or over $4 million a year. How's that for ROI? My best advice for saving meeting booking time: don’t book meetings!  Status meetings or meetings to talk about the status of the status meetings are the worst offenders — a waste of time that could be better used. Our research shows productivity gains of 20 percent by just getting rid of status meetings. Consider instead offering a dynamic, ongoing update in a project or task space, so people don’t have to meet just to see where a project is. There's a clear future for online personal assistants and chat bots that help us deal with the mandates of work, which is why so much R&D is going into conversational interfaces. Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, and other voice-based interfaces offer a lot of promise.  But don’t look at these personal assistants for creative solutions to meeting scheduling. The best AIs, personal assistants and bots will know when to pass these on to you for scheduling.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews As emoji grow more popular, the “language” also risks fragmentation As more emoji are created, it will take more work to keep them universal. by Andrew Cunningham - Aug 17, 2016 5:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark Andrew Cunningham Emoji in iOS 10. Andrew Cunningham Emoji in iOS 10. Andrew Cunningham Emoji in Android 7. Andrew Cunningham Emoji in the Windows 10 Anniversary update. Emoji have become important. They’ve permeated our conversations and our messaging apps and our popular culture to a degree that no one could have anticipated just a few years ago, and when your phone or computer gets an update, new emoji are often featured prominently in the release notes or even announced in their own press releases. That the “language” is so universal and recognizable is due in large part to the Unicode Consortium, the group of major tech companies in charge of defining and approving new emoji (and dozens of other character sets, besides). Every year, it proposes, discusses, and approves new additions to the language, and that heavyweights like Apple, Google, and Microsoft have become so diligent about supporting new versions is a rare victory for standards in an age where every tech company on Earth is trying to lock you into its own proprietary silo. But the Unicode Consortium can only do so much to influence the way any given emoji looks and is interpreted. Every new version of the Unicode spec includes a description of each character, a sample image, and other broad recommendations for implementation, but companies implementing the spec are free to represent the emoji pretty much however they want. And as the language’s range of expression continues to grow, so do the opportunities for misunderstanding. “Zero-width joiners” and compound emoji The Unicode Consortium has been working hard over the last couple of releases to fix the language’s representation problem—multiple skin tones were proposed in 2014 and began to see widespread use in 2015, and this year’s update ensures that both male and female images exist for all the emoji occupations. And before we continue, let’s pause to acknowledge that representation is important, and it’s great that the Unicode Consortium is prioritizing it, full stop. Traditionally, every emoji character has had an alphanumerical code associated with it, and creating a new emoji meant coming up with a new code to associate with it. For skin tone and gender, the Unicode Consortium has come up with more creative solutions, choosing instead to combine multiple codes together to create a single emoji. The gender-diverse emoji for occupations, for example, combine a standard “man” or “woman” emoji with a second emoji to represent the occupation, and they’re glued together by a special invisible character called a “Zero-width joiner” (ZWJ). Platforms that support the new emoji for occupations, including both the upcoming iOS 10 and Android Nougat releases, see the ZWJ and know to display a single emoji rather than two separate ones. It’s a smart way to continue expanding the number of available emoji while keeping the number of unique codes under control, and different sequences can be used to create emoji that are much more representative and specific than they were a couple of years ago. For example, ZWJ sequences are why the “kissing” and “love” and “family” emoji now have so many possible combinations. In Unicode 6.0, there was one emoji for family; now there are many more. The Unicode Consortium tracks common ZWJ sequences (any “that are supported on at least one commonly available platform”) so that companies building software can easily support them, but here’s where we start running into potential problems. Since emoji cobbled together with ZWJ characters don’t need to be approved by the Unicode Consortium like an all-new emoji character does, it means that companies can build their own unique emoji without waiting for the Unicode Consortium to approve them. And since these ZWJ emoji will simply show up as two or more separate emoji on platforms that don’t support them, adding new ones doesn’t technically break anything or result in an ugly question mark block. This can make developing new emoji faster; without a months- or years-long approval process, Apple or Google could go ahead and add flags or fix representation problems quickly without breaking compatibility with other platforms. On the other hand, it can make it more difficult to communicate between platforms based on which ZWJ sequences are supported and which aren’t. “If this is taken to extremes, it could result in entire sets of incompatible emojis that are indecipherable on other platforms,” Jeremy Burge, founder of Emojipedia, told Ars. “That would be a problem.” We’re already starting to see some fragmentation as platforms add their own specific ZWJ emoji, characters that the enthusiasts at Emojipedia can keep on top of but that the official Unicode list can’t. Twitter has a pirate flag, the Windows 10 Anniversary Update adds a bunch of “ninja cat” emoji as an in-joke for Windows Insiders, and WhatsApp just added an Olympic Rings emoji that shows up as five plain circles on any other platform. Sometimes the broken-down sequences have a relatively clear meaning (the pirate flag), but often the intended meaning is vague (Olympic rings, Ninja Cat). And software makers are being left to police themselves when it comes to creating these emoji and implementing emoji created by others. “I can see a real dilemma for vendors if ZWJ proliferate in unexpected ways,” Burge told Ars. “In particular, sequences such as the Olympic Rings emoji introduced by WhatsApp don’t follow conventions that other vendors use (it’s made of non-emoji characters), and to top it off it’s a copyrighted image which no other platform could introduce!” I would expect Apple, Google, and the rest to be relatively conservative about introducing their own platform-specific emoji even with ZWJ characters, but going forward they could introduce more potential for confusion when communicating across different platforms or services. This is what Unicode was created to avoid, but there have always been inconsistencies even without ZWJ characters. Apple vs. the world Enlarge / One of these things is not like the others. Emojipedia The Unicode Consortium provides names and sample images for all emoji, but, as that page and any Emojipedia article can show you, the pictures you’ll see on actual phones and computers all look slightly different. Different OS and app developers want the emoji to match the rest of their software’s aesthetic rather than using one universal character set. Typically, this isn’t a problem. A smiling or frowning face will look different on iOS and Android, but they both convey the same information. At worst, a handful of characters are mildly ambiguous or just a little weird—the “grinning face with smiling eyes” emoji looks more like a grimace on Apple devices. Samsung devices render the cookie emoji as a pair of snack crackers rather than the usual chocolate chip-style. Android 4.4 inexplicably rendered the yellow heart emoji as a hairy heart instead. But every once in a while the difference is big enough that it could cause problems—case in point, the iOS 10 pistol emoji, which will look like a bright green squirt gun rather than a handgun. All other current platforms render it as a handgun, and the Windows 10 Anniversary update even changed the icon into a handgun rather than the '50s-style sci-fi ray gun that Windows used previously. Apple similarly lobbied (successfully) to have a new rifle emoji removed from Unicode 9.0. Regardless of your position on gun control and whether you think these changes will move the needle at all (for my part I think the changes are well-intentioned but not likely to make much of a difference), making an emoji weapon look so different from the Unicode sample and every other platform creates a real potential for serious misunderstanding. It’s particularly problematic when Apple goes its own way because the company is often seen as the “default” for emoji designs—when you see emoji in the real world, they usually look like Apple’s. Apple didn’t invent emoji by any stretch of the imagination, but by including an easily accessible emoji keyboard in iOS 5, by enabling that keyboard by default in iOS 8, and by adopting new emoji in iOS 9.1 and iOS 10, the company has been instrumental in introducing the character set to new users and helping it spread. Ideally, all parties using Unicode would do their best to stick to the established examples laid out by the Consortium; doing otherwise introduces too much potential for miscommunication. In practice, the major companies using Unicode are mostly maintaining similar character sets by self-policing, looking around at each other and tweaking their emoji to be more in line with what others are doing (often, this means changing them to look more like Apple’s). “The varied appearance of emoji on different platforms I see as a lesser issue in 2016 than it has been in the past,” Burge told Ars, “and an issue that is slowly resolving itself as platforms look to one another for cues on consistency.” In cases like the pistol emoji, it would ultimately be better for Apple to voice its concerns to the Unicode Consortium rather than going off and doing its own thing. But given past behavior, the ecosystem may shift back to a more uniform representation of the pistol emoji by itself without the need for strict oversight or external pressure. As the language grows and becomes more expressive, the potential for misunderstanding and fragmentation increases, but hopefully the desire to maintain a consistent, universal, easy-to-understand character set will outweigh any particular company’s desire to make sweeping changes based on its whims. “I truly believe one of the reasons for the success of emoji has been the cross-platform nature,” Burge told Ars. “We have had graphical emoticons for years, but these tended to be for one app or platform only. The universal nature of emoji is a key part of what people enjoy. You can send an emoji and know the other person will see it, even if some platforms vary exactly how these look. “It’s in the interests of each platform to be responsive to users, so if enough people demand cross-platform emoji support to continue as it does today, vendors should take that into account,” he added.

I would much rather vote for Big Bird for president than either Trump or Clinton! — Jennifer Irons (@TeamBobbyEwing) August 7, 2016 Before you panic, Google isn’t telling anyone who to vote for, just informing them how to vote where they live.

Technology Is Bad For Your Sex Life Millenials are having less sex with less people and waiting longer before losing their virginity. And these trends are being blamed on technology Is Smarter Technology Dumbing Down the Human Race? Is Smarter Technology Dumbing Down the Human Race? As a child, you memorized your friend's phone numbers; now you just add them to your phone. You used to memorize directions; now you just use your GPS. Are humans becoming stupid? Read More . This is all according to recent research in the Archives of Sexual Behavior which saw researchers analyzing data on adult sexual habits from the General Social Survey. The research suggests that Millenials (people born in the 1980s or 1990s) are having their first sexual encounter at an older age, and then having fewer sexual partners than the previous two generations (Baby Boomers and Generation X). Which would seem to go against the notion that youngsters are constantly engaging in horizontal dancing. Most sexperts are blaming technology in one way or another. Some are claiming online dating is putting too much emphasis on looks, while others are claiming online pornography is replacing the need for physical relationships. Whatever the truth, Millenials are, as a group, having less sex than other generations did at their age. Which could lead to a fall in birthrates.

" So even though the least intelligent person knows that there are more than 2 candidates, MakeUseOF seems to want imply to its readers that th only "REAL and TRUE" choices are those from majority parties and not from minority parties. MUO probably wants people to think their vote is only valid when cast for someone considered winnable. Like almost all media, MUO treats minority parties as interesting side-notes but NEVER to be seriously considered ! Reply Dave Parrack August 17, 2016 at 9:48 pm There's no conspiracy theory here, Howard. I'm a Brit, so talking about the U.S. Election isn't exactly my forte. Nothing more, nothing less. BUT, having said that, it is a fact that only the two candidates I named can actually be President. You can vote for one of the others, but it won't impact the result. Just for you though, I have edited the article to make it clear these are Republican and Democratic candidates, and not the only names on the ballot. Happy now?! Reply Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 12:34 am Lol, you are the one who decided to post just the two major party candidates WHEN you didn't have to post any to make your point . Why did you do that ? Reply Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 12:37 am The fact that there are the only two who can win is no reason support Hitler or Stalin in a race where Abraham Lincoln cannot win as a 3rd party canidate Reply Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 4:28 pm With reasoning like this, it's hard to understand why more people don't take the Libertarian party less seriously. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 9:27 pm And you would vote for either Hitler or Stalin then, because they are the ones who can win ? How interesting, now that I call "real" logic. And your party doesn't even support freedom of association - preferring state-mandated ones instead :) Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 9:57 pm Your logic has more glitches than Windows Vista. Your first fallacy, which you have continued, is to associate the two major parties with two of the deadliest dictators of all time. Let's examine the facts. Hitler and his regime killed close to 30 million people during World War II. During his 30-year reign, Stalin killed anywhere from 20 to 60 million people separately from the casualties of World War II, according to http://www.ibtimes.com/how-many-people-did-joseph-stalin-kill-1111789 Trump and Clinton have not been proven to have killed anyone. And that's just capital crime. Never mind the fact that you've invoked Godwin's Law, which basically ruins any political discussion by bringing up Hitler. There's also the fact that neither major U.S. party's policies bear any similarity whatsoever to those of either the Nazi party or Stalinist Communism. In fact, those parties were both single-party: you were either a member or you were most likely in deep trouble. Your second fallacy was to assume I am a member of either the Democratic or Republican parties. You failed to even cite evidence for such a claim. You say, "Your party doesn't even support freedom of association (fallacy three, by the way, since you don't know what party I'm in), but both the Democratic and Republican parties strongly support the First Amendment, which specifically guarantees the right to peaceably assemble--or, in other words, freedom of association. Fallacy four is this ridiculous claim you make that "state-mandated" associations are supported by either party. Again, you've made no citation. As it happens, I am an independent, and strongly support eliminating closed primaries in all 50 states, plus any territories with the right to vote in the present or the future. This would immediately strengthen the smaller parties. I also support debates among candidates of all parties. While I support its right to field candidates, I don't support the Libertarian Party platform, but I wish your party the best of luck. Unfortunately, one of the major problems with all the smaller parties is that none of them seem willing to push for party representation in the House or Senate, or in the state and commonwealth legislatures. To quote Captain Malcolm Reynolds, my days of not taking you seriously are certainly coming to a middle. Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 9:58 pm Your logic has more glitches than Windows Vista.

Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 10:05 pm This was never an argument about Hillary or Trump .. bu the view that one must vote for a candidate what can win . And about favoring major parties over minor by the media. Do you support state-mandate wages for employment associations ? Like some conservatives support state-mandated opposite-sex for marriage associations? As I told you, I support freedom of ALL associations. I'll bet my life that you don't :) Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 10:46 pm Fortunately for you, I don't intend to collect, but you lose. Of course I support freedom of association, and equal rights, hence my earlier comment about opening all primaries and strengthening smaller parties. Perhaps if you actually paid attention to my replies, you'd stop claiming incorrect information about where I stand. And I don't even understand your question. What's an employment association? A labor union? An employment agency? What do you hope to accomplish with your screed? Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 11:03 pm You never did say whether you supported state-mandated wages for employment associations? Do you support your right to associate with entities that call themselves states ? Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 11:11 pm An employment association would be primarily one between employer and employee Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 11:28 pm Where I'm from, we call that a job. And what do "state-mandated wages" have to do with anything we were previously trying to discuss? And what does "Do you support your right to associate with entities that call themselves states ?" even mean? Please restate the questions in a clear, concise fashion. I'll answer them if I feel like it. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 11:49 pm You are the one who claimed to believe in freedom of association, I was following that up with whether you believed in the state-mandated minimum wage for employment associations or whether you supported freedom of (employments) association. Same witht the 2nd question. Now be honest and try to answer the questions and not change the subject Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 11:53 pm Not change the subject? That's what you were doing. And you're just making terms up now. If you had simply asked if I supported a minimum wage, I would simply have said yes, but the issue of minimum wage has nothing at all to do with freedom of association without the idiotic verbal gymnastic stumbling you're doing to equate them. I'm done debating the political issues with you, because your personal issues seem to be getting in the way. I'm never going to take you seriously. And if you're what the Libertarian Party is about, then I feel the same way about them. You're an excellent example of why MakeUseOf's comments section should have a block function, though. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 19, 2016 at 12:00 am I could have asked that, but then that would be to ingore the fact that the association between you and your employer IS an association COVERED by Freedom of Association Now we know you support state-mandated wages for (employment) associations. I doubt anyone would consider that freedom of association. Perry F. Bruns August 19, 2016 at 12:16 am My, but you're hilarious. Are you an actual human being in need of medical attention or a small shell script? What is your basis for the ridiculous idea that "...the association between you and your employer IS an association COVERED by Freedom of Association"? Just to clear up any further wacky questions, I support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948. It's not perfect, but it's compatible with the U.S. Constitution, and it fills in a lot of the blanks of that latter august document, complete with clearer, simpler language. I draw your attention (or your coder's) to Article 23, which states in its entirety: Article 23. (1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. (2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. (3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection. (4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 19, 2016 at 12:20 am Yep go for the insults like a typical uniformed person on the rules logic :) I'm sorry you can't admit your obvious contradiction. Weak! Perry F. Bruns August 19, 2016 at 1:20 am Well, since you never made a single point, I got tired of the one-sidedness of the argument, and had to keep myself entertained somehow. I have to admit a grudging admiration for you, though: I've never met a single person whose every sentence seemed like a complete coincidence. And I was once "uniformed." You left out an "n." And a thesis. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 19, 2016 at 12:51 pm One sidedness ? first you dare to claim you support freedom of association then come right back stating your support state-mandated wage rates for employment associations - restricting the associations a person may enter into. I'm reminded of the problems gays had forming marriage associations fighting people like you People who support state-mandated association over free and voluntary ones guaranteed by the LIBERAL concept of freedom of association are supporting fascist acts - regardless of from the right or the left.. Perry F. Bruns August 19, 2016 at 12:54 pm Well, now you're just spouting talking points. You are a sad, strange little man. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 19, 2016 at 1:28 pm Hmm, well your points are debatable as worth talking about.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Google faces legal action over data-mining emails 17 Aug 2016 0 Google, Law & order, Privacy Post navigation Previous: Facebook’s unblockable-ads push is a “big bluff” Next: Why you STILL can’t trust password strength meters by Alison Booth 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit For Google, the long-running dispute over its data-mining of email just won’t go away. Last Friday, the US District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order denying Google’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by plaintiff Daniel Matera which alleged that Google violated federal and state wiretapping laws in its operation of Gmail. The Wiretap Act prohibits the interception of wire, oral and electronic communications. The headache that just won’t go away In March 2014, the US District Court for the Northern District of California heard a lawsuit complaining that Google was scanning millions of students’ emails to build up profiles of users’ interests so it could target advertising at them. The nine plaintiffs in that lawsuit similarly alleged that Google violated the Wiretap Act. But US District Judge Lucy Koh, denied the request for class-action status since it would be impossible to determine which email users consented to Google’s privacy policies. A short time later, after admitting to Education Week that it automatically “scans and indexes” the emails of its Apps for Education users even though ads are off by default, Google announced in a blog post that it had: … permanently removed all ads scanning in Gmail for Apps for Education, which means Google cannot collect or use student data in Apps for Education services for advertising purposes. Google might have thought that move would put the data mining controversy to bed. But no … This latest ruling In this latest twist, Judge Koh found Google’s policy of intercepting and scanning emails before they reach the inbox of the intended recipient may violate the California Wiretap Act and denied Google’s motion to dismiss Matera’s lawsuit. Matera is not a Google customer but claims that the “ubiquity of the email service” means that Google has still intercepted, scanned and analysed his and many others’ emails: [Matera] seeks to represent non-Gmail users “who have never established an email account with Google, and who have sent emails to or received emails from individuals with Google email accounts.” He claims that Google is intercepting and scanning his emails for commercial purposes: Google allegedly acquires and interprets the content of emails sent or received by Gmail users through “Content Onebox” and “Changeling,” which are “distinct piece[s] of Google’s infrastructure.” Google then uses a process called “Nemo” to determine how to best monetize the data extracted from the intercepted emails. Google’s defense In its defense, Google argued that scanning emails was an intrinsic part of its service – part of the ordinary day-to-day operations of its business that meets the “ordinary course of business” exemption in the Wiretap Act. Koh disagreed, noting that just because something is routine it doesn’t automatically fall within the scope of the “ordinary course of business” and that Google had shown in 2014 that it could operate Gmail for specific groups of users without scanning their emails. The ruling, as Ars Technica reports, means Google now has no chance of getting the lawsuit, which was filed in September, thrown out early. The controversy over Google’s scanning of non-users’ emails will rumble on.

Annie Palmer Aug 17, 2016 9:39 AM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Alphabet  (GOOGL)  were lower in early morning trading on Wednesday as Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) failed to reach a settlement with the parent company's Google in an anti-trust case.  The regulator last week imposed a $6.85 million fine on Google after ruling in 2015 that the search engine giant was abusing its power by requiring the pre-installation of several Google apps on Android devices, Reuters reports.  Google appealed the ruling and FAS said an out-of-court settlement was possible if the company could admit to violations of antitrust laws and pay a fine.  The European Commission is also looking into Google's Android practices. EC officials said the "tie between Play Store and other Google apps is what we see as a very problematic behavior," according to Tech Crunch. The officials added that it has become too challenging for other products and app stores to market their apps to customers.  Google currently dominates about 80% of the global smartphone operating system market, TechCrunch added.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. TheStreet Ratings has this to say about the recommendation: We rate ALPHABET INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity and reasonable valuation levels. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results.

Reuters reported, citing local media, that the court had turned down Google’s request to review the case. That outcome came after Russian authorities and the search giant was reportedly unable to reach a settlement in the case. ADVERTISEMENT Regulator FAS leveled a roughly $6.8 million fine last week over allegations that Google violated antitrust laws when it required some applications be packaged with phones running its popular Android operating system. Russian search leader Yandex filed the complaint that sparked the inquiry. A spokesperson for Google did not respond to a request for comment. Google isn’t a stranger to antitrust headaches, having drawn the attention of regulators around the world as it has expanded in size and scope. Competitors argue that Google is able to leverage its dominance in areas like search and mobile operating systems to unfairly maintain it advantage and hurt smaller players. The European Union’s antitrust watchdog, led by competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, has brought three sets of preliminary charges against Google in recent years. It alleges that Google has inappropriately favored its own comparison shopping service in search results, taken advantage of its dominant advertising platform and unfairly required manufacturers to install applications on Android phones. Antitrust officials in South Korea have also confirmed that they are investigating Google but have not specified the nature of their concerns. Stateside, the Federal Trade Commission has proved more reticent about alleging the company has violated the law. The agency spent years investigating Google’s dominance in search but ultimately decided not to take legal action, although the company agreed to make some changes to its practices. Politico reported earlier this year, however, that the regulator is once again examining Google’s search business.

He wrote some of the more data driven books about links back in the day and has inspired a lot of of the older SEOs. And now, he has his very own Google micro-moment large poster sign. It seems Google's Think With Google program has a Micro Moments campaign where they try to get advertisers to think about how important it is to get the customer to think about your brand and solution right from their first search (i.e. on mobile). Mike Grehan I guess submitted his micro-moment quote and Google liked it so they published it here and sent him a poster with it and his face 'cartoonized' on it. Mike posted it on Google+ and said "How cool is this? I just received a package from Google with my own "micro-moment" in it. They got the quote right, the black specs and black shirt... And even covered my grey with a little color in my hair - how kind." Ah, the good old days before mobile. :) This post is part of our daily Search Photo of the Day column, where we find fun and interesting photos related to the search industry and share them with our readers. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: YouTuber, Caspar Lee Breaks Into Google To Eat Algorithm   Comments: Mike Grehan 08/17/2016 01:59 pm Barry, the gift was to contributors at the Think with Google publication.

We learn a lot of new tidbits from there and also start a bit of controversy after covering things he may or may not mean to say. That being said, Google Hangouts is going away, Google announced it is gone as of September 12, 2016. That means Google needs to find a new venue to host these webmaster hangouts or try something new. Of course, YouTube Live lets you do Hangouts On Air, but I don't see a QA feature which they use to manage the questions beforehand. There is YouTube Live Chat, which may work but that is only live. He can ask people to post questions somewhere else? John Mueller doesn't seem nervous about it, he told me on Twitter "We'll see how things work out :-). I imagine there will be some rocky times." @rustybrick Probably! We'll see how things work out :-). I imagine there will be some rocky times. pic.twitter.com/7E7dd4SaQc— John Mueller (@JohnMu) August 16, 2016 In any event, John scheduled several more Google Webmaster Hangouts on Google+ throughout September 9th, as the following Monday, the feature goes offline. So make sure to check out the last ones, if you can. I do wonder how John will handle this going forward but I suspect he will try YouTube Live. Forum discussion at Twitter. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Bing Ads Upgraded URLs Now Supported   Comments: PleaseContinue 08/17/2016 01:07 pm We need these Hangouts! I think John is the only person on Google who really tries to help people! Hopefully he continues in some kind of way...cheers NewWorldDisorder 08/17/2016 05:41 pm No more hangouts, a webmaster help forum where Google staff rarely comments, not provided keyword data in Analytics, people bitching about zombies and mass market manipulation, adwords users complaining about no conversions, etc. WTF is wrong with the naive webmaster community and small business owners? Google is a major international company and they provide jack shit for support and no lines of communication. Yet webmasters and small businesses as a whole appear content with the nothing Google gives back to their customers (users and advertisers alike). Will it take a regulator to step in and do what the passive and largely impotent webmaster and small business community won't do and demand more along with some transparency? LOL at you impotent SEO gurus, webmasters and small businesses that just bend over and take it any ole way Google will give it to you! Dawn Anderson 08/17/2016 06:51 pm The hangouts are invaluable. Been a great source of learning for me for the past few years. I really hope they continue in some way Pedro Matias 08/17/2016 07:22 pm Yes, John is the last one of a Google that no longer exists. you suck 08/17/2016 10:56 pm "Google Hangouts is going away," No just hangouts on air. crappy reporting.. Barry Schwartz 08/17/2016 11:07 pm Hangouts on air is still available in YouTube live. Anon User 08/18/2016 07:42 am That is so untrue. Google are more than happy to call you and get you to spend more on adwords. Saying they have no support is hogwash. If you go on the google forums for instance, you are guaranteed to be abused by someone quoting the google guidelines at you. You will be belittled for not being able to read between the lines and you will be called a spammer for having a few dodgy links in your profile going back 15 years. All this abuse of course is designed to help you understand that it is googles ball and they make the rules. You are free to go to dog pile or duck duck duck duck duck for your searches. Nobody is forcing you or anyone else to use google. NewWorldDisorder 08/18/2016 01:11 pm "If you go on the google forums for instance, you are guaranteed to be abused by someone quoting the google guidelines at you." LOL. That largely unmoderated forum Google has is an impotent SEO/webmaster magnet. No where on the web do so many clueless and impotent SEOs/Webmasters gather. And to be honest, many of them seem to like being belittled because they are impotent individuals and they often come back for more abuse. Gil Melo 08/18/2016 04:57 pm kind of misleading article title. Hangouts on air will not be discontinued. It's just moving out G+ to YouTube Livestream. The Service will still be available just not on G+. You can create the event and plug the link from you tube there. Gil Melo 08/18/2016 04:59 pm It will still be available via YouTube Livestream. We did out last 2 hangouts using the Livestream. Works fine Barry Schwartz 08/18/2016 05:00 pm Not really. There are several features that Google Hangouts has that YouTube Live does not and visa versa. Big one is the QA feature. Gil Melo 08/18/2016 05:03 pm Article first paragraph says: "Google Hangouts is going away". That's what I was referring to. Barry Schwartz 08/18/2016 05:07 pm titles are hard for non journalists. good thing I have comments Gil Melo 08/18/2016 05:07 pm Create and event and monitor the question from there. That's what we do. We gave up on Q&A quite a while ago. But I'm sure it's a different experience for each person. Barry Schwartz 08/18/2016 05:07 pm Curious to see what John Mueller does Gil Melo 08/18/2016 05:09 pm Well, you got me reading. ;) Gil Melo 08/18/2016 05:11 pm I have a rough doc I quick put together for our moderator.

Truth is, I am not sure if the migration is complete, but looking at the not provided count now versus a year ago, it has jumped 5 points across virtually all the properties I've checked that have significant traffic. Most properties had a 92% or 93% not provided count a year ago when you looked at just Google search keywords in Google Analytics. Now, I see between 96.25% and 98.25% of the keyword data being reported as not provided. I assume it will hit 100% when HSTS is fully live? Of course, you can get some of this data in the Google Search Analytics report, which is also built into Google Analytics but the data is not as pure as you'd like from the referral. John Mueller of Google said this on Twitter. @haghadi @googlewmc I'd recommend using Search Console's Search Analytics feature for that.

By JONAH M. KESSEL and PAUL MOZUR on Publish Date August 9, 2016. Photo by Damir Sagolj/Reuters. Watch in Times Video » embed HONG KONG — For teenagers who like to sing along with Ariana Grande and Flo Rida, Musical.ly is a must-have. The app that lets users lip-sync and dance in their own music videos boasts 100 million users and partners with pop stars like Ms. Grande and Meghan Trainor. It’s not easy to tell Musical.ly is Chinese — and that’s deliberate. To find success in America, its parent company has ignored China, its home market and a country with 700 million internet users. The reason is simple, says Alex Zhu, co-founder of Shanghai-based Musical.ly: China’s internet is fundamentally different from the one used in much of the rest of the world. “It’s still very difficult to get into China,” said Mr. Zhu, who studied civil engineering at Zhejiang University in the eastern city of Hangzhou. “It’s a closed environment, and you have to be quite different to compete in that market.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Two decades after Beijing began walling off its homegrown internet from the rest of the planet, the digital world has split between China and everybody else. That has prevented American technology companies like Facebook and Uber, which recently agreed to sell its China operations, from independently being able to tap the Chinese market. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story For China’s web companies, the divide may have even more significant implications. It has penned in the country’s biggest and most innovative internet companies. Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent have grown to be some of the world’s largest internet companies, but they rely almost entirely on domestic businesses. Their ventures abroad have been mostly desultory, and prognostications that they will challenge American giants internationally have not materialized. Photo Alex Zhu, co-founder of Musical.ly, in a meeting with staff members at the company’s offices in Shanghai. Credit Gilles Sabrie for The New York Times For Chinese web start-ups like Musical.ly, the internet split has also forced them to choose — either create something that caters to China’s digital population or focus on the rest of the globe. In many ways, the split is like 19th century railroads in the United States, when rails of different sizes hindered a train’s ability to go from one place to another. “The barrier to entering the U.S. or China market is becoming higher and higher,” said Kai-fu Lee, a venture investor from Taiwan and former head of Google China. The difficulties that China’s internet companies face in expanding their success abroad are epitomized by WeChat, the messaging app owned by Tencent. In China, WeChat combines e-commerce and real-world services in ways that have Western companies playing catch-up. It has about 700 million users, most of whom are Chinese or use it to connect with people in China. In 2012, armed with a cash stockpile of several hundred million dollars, the world soccer star Lionel Messi as a spokesman and local ads like Bollywood-inspired commercials in India, Tencent began a push that executives said would be its best chance of breaking out of China. The effort flopped. Critics pointed to Tencent’s lack of distinctive marketing, a record of censorship and surveillance in China and its late arrival to foreign markets. Yet the biggest problem was that outside of China, WeChat was just not the same. Within China, WeChat can be used to do almost everything, like pay bills, hail a taxi, book a doctor’s appointment, share photos and chat. Yet its ability to do that is dependent on other Chinese internet services that are limited outside the country. Advertisement Continue reading the main story That leaves WeChat outside China as an app that people mostly use to chat and share photos — not that different from WhatsApp and Messenger, which are both owned by Facebook. Baidu and Alibaba have apps that similarly offer a range of capabilities, yet are less useful outside China. Photo A screenshot of a video by a popular user of Musical.ly, an app that combines social media and music. Credit Gilles Sabrie for The New York Times The same problem hurts start-ups in China. Those companies start out accustomed to using Chinese internet sites and apps to market and enhance their business. But going abroad means a different world of services to master, such as a solid understanding of Facebook and Google’s platforms and ads, not Baidu’s and Tencent’s. By contrast, Musical.ly chose the opposite approach and linked itself to the most popular social networks in the United States. If someone records an impressively coordinated dance or flawlessly lip-synced song, the person can put it up not just on the app, but also add it to Instagram, send it on WhatsApp or post it to Facebook. That has helped Musical.ly grow naturally to Europe, South America and Southeast Asia, Mr. Zhu said. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times “The thing about this young generation in the U.S. is, they’re creative,” said Mr. Zhu. “They’ll say, ‘Please follow me on Instagram or Snapchat.’ If your app can attract some people in an age group and make them super excited to share, you will probably grow.” For Cheetah Mobile, a maker of smartphone utility apps based in Beijing whose users are mostly outside China, the solution was finding a steppingstone to the rest of the world. In early 2014, it opened an office in Taiwan, where use of Google and Facebook dominates. That helped it gain employees who intimately understood Facebook, YouTube and other major Western platforms that could be used for advertising. “Taiwan served as a bridge for us across the Pacific to the United States,” said Charles Fan, Cheetah’s chief technology officer. Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu have all opened American offices, but they have mostly turned to investments and acquisitions to gain footholds overseas. Over the last two years, Alibaba has invested in emerging markets, including two online commerce companies, Paytm and Snapdeal, in India. It also spent $1 billion to acquire Lazada, an e-commerce site popular in Southeast Asia. Tencent has been more aggressive in Western markets. In June, it made its largest overseas deal, paying $8.6 billion for Supercell, the Finnish company that created the popular mobile game Clash of Clans. Tencent also has a stake in the games company Activision Blizzard and bought one of the most played games in the world, League of Legends.

Credit Gilles Sabrie for The New York Times Perhaps the greatest indication of Tencent’s overseas ambitions was a deal that never happened. In 2014, with its global WeChat campaign faltering, it was preparing to start negotiations to bid for WhatsApp when Facebook swooped in, according to a senior Tencent executive who asked for anonymity in discussing corporate strategy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tencent and Baidu declined to comment. An Alibaba spokeswoman referred to recent remarks by Alibaba’s president, J. Michael Evans, in which he pointed to acquisitions as a way the company was attracting new consumers in developing markets. He also said Alibaba was focused on attracting more foreign businesses to sell on its markets in China. Mr. Lee said it might take a new technological jump for Chinese companies to get a chance at building a platform inside China and internationally. He said Chinese companies could prove competitive in emerging sectors like virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robotics. “I think what might be surprising is, China will catch up rapidly,” he said. “Partly because of Chinese universities, partly because of returnees to China who form a portion of the top engineers in the world.” Musical.ly is in many ways a product of the cultural exchange between the United States and China that Mr. Lee described. Mr. Zhu, 37, graduated from a Chinese university, but moved to the United States with the German software company SAP in 2010. He had the idea for the music app while riding the train from San Francisco to Mountain View, Calif., in a car full of high school students. “Half were listening to music and the other half were using their phone to take photos and add emojis, and they were passing them around,” Mr. Zhu said. Then it hit him: combine the selfie and social media part with the music part and turn it into one product. In 2015, Mr. Zhu moved to Shanghai, where his co-founder has been based since Musical.ly’s 2013 inception. Yet Musical.ly is unlikely to be the social network to link both sides of the Pacific. For the demographic the app is focusing on, it’s far better to be outside its home market, Mr. Zhu said. “Teenagers in the U.S. are a golden audience,” he said. “If you look at China, the teenage culture doesn’t exist — the teens are super busy in school studying for tests, so they don’t have the time and luxury to play social media apps.” Follow Paul Mozur on Twitter @paulmozur.

Here's why. By Andy Wolber | August 17, 2016, 7:31 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Andy Wolber/TechRepublic Every year, I experiment with going iPad-only for a bit. And every year, it gets easier as more services deliver websites that work on mobile devices and more vendors offer native mobile apps. More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter I do the majority of my work in various Google apps. For example, I write my articles for TechRepublic with Google Docs. I also rely on Google Docs and Drive to share information with my clients. When I present, I use Google Slides. And, Google Calendar, Keep, Inbox, and Hangouts help me manage appointments, tasks, and messages. I use all of these apps on an iPad daily. Over the past few years, I've written several articles to suggest workarounds to help people use Google apps on iOS devices (see the links at the end of the post). Sometimes, I needed a third-party app to complete my work. Other times, I had to take an arcane series of steps to accomplish a task. But now, thanks to the following changes, most of those workarounds are no longer needed. SEE: Apple's enterprise tablet challenge: Does the iPad Pro measure up? (Tech Pro Research) Many Google iPad apps support Split View Google's core document productivity apps on the iPad finally support Split View. You can edit a Google Doc while you browse the web with Chrome, or adjust a Slide as you refer to information in Google Sheets. Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides all now support Split View. Split View lets you see two apps at once. (Split View requires an iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, or newer devices, such as the iPad Pro line.) To access Split View, open an app. Next, drag your finger in from the right side of the screen. You'll see several app icons. Scroll to the one you want, then tap it. That will show the app in Slide Over mode. Next, tap on the small white vertical line that displays to the left of the app and drag it to the center of the screen. When you lift your finger, you'll see your two apps side-by-side. The green dots illustrate which Google apps support Split View on an iPad. (To see more apps that work in Split View on your iPad, open an app, then slide your finger in from the right side.) Image: Andy Wolber/TechRepublic Improved editing The editing capabilities of Docs, Sheets, and Slides on iOS have improved, too. Auto-created document outlines make it easier to navigate long documents. Smarter offline settings sync files to your device so you can work offline. A new questions and answer feature in Slides helps you engage audience members. And, of course, you can create links, count words, and insert images in Google Docs—all essential features for writers. The mobile apps include Office Compatibility Mode, so you can use Docs, Sheets, and Slides to make changes to Word, Excel, or PowerPoint documents. Open the file, edit it, and save your changes. If you need to collaborate with colleagues on those documents, convert the file to a native Google format to share it with other people. Install the Gboard keyboard to add search and swipe-typing at your fingertips wherever you use a keyboard on your iPad (or iPhone). Image: Andy Wolber/TechRepublic Search and swipe as you type Gboard adds search and swipe-typing to a keyboard that you can use when you type in any iOS app. (Gboard supports image, GIF, and emoji search, too.) Tap the Google logo in the keyboard, type a keyword, search, then copy or insert the results with a tap. Even if you don't have a newer iPad that supports Split View, the Gboard keyboard lets you search, then insert results, without switching to another app. Think of it as mini-multitasking at your fingertips. SEE: Research: The impact of tablets in the workplace (Tech Pro Research) Updates still needed As of August 2016, a few Google iPad app updates would be welcomed. Gmail and Google's newer email app, Inbox, both lack support for Split View: It would be nice to be able to draft an email and refer to a document at the same time. Also, the YouTube app supports Split View, but not picture-in-picture. (Yes, there's a workaround.) But, the app that may need an update the most is Google Calendar. It's an iPhone app: Tap the 2x button to see your calendar at an enormously odd size on your iPad—and only in portrait orientation. iPad only? For me, the improvements to Google Docs and the addition of Gboard make working "iPad only" feasible. Most importantly, I can add links and keep track of my document word count. And iPad-only travel means I don't have to worry about either the weight or battery life of a laptop. If you tried at one time to use Google apps on an iPad but gave up, I encourage you to install the core apps—Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides—along with Gboard, and try again.

The FAS argued that requiring other vendors install “mandatory preset of Google applications and the search system and their mandatory placement in the priority positions on device home pages” in order to have access to the Google Play application store constituted an unfair market advantage. Essentially, it agreed with the argument of native Russian search engine Yandex, which was an original party to the suit. Google has yet to announce whether it will pay the fine or continue the appeal, but given the company is still under investigation by the European Commission (EC) for for the very same practice, it is unlikely that company will admit to engaging in monopolistic practices, as any such admission could be used against the company in future antitrust proceedings. With a nearly 80 percent share in the mobile OS market, Google has created an environment in which, as the EC’s Margrethe Vestager said, “it has become too difficult for other products, other app stores to present their apps to the consumer.” Scott Eric Kaufman is an assistant editor at Salon.

The Asia Pacific is expected to lead developer population globally for the next several years, with India projected to reach four million in 2018. “We’re seeing how in the space of a year, the possibilities introduced by the Internet of Things has attracted many developers,” says Michael Rasalan, director of research for Evans Data Corp., which provides information technology (IT) market intelligence based on surveys. “This transition to IoT, while not without barriers, is rapid, because developers are able to leverage existing knowledge and expertise in complementary technologies like cloud and mobile, to create entirely new use cases. We’re also seeing developers branch out from concepts on wearables to applications for more complex tasks, seen in the industrial space.” Alcatel-Lucent, Nokia, Emtec, Apple, Wipro Technologies, and Target are just a few of the companies seeking developers in India, but job requirements are strict, requiring a Bachelor or Master’s degree in computer science or electronics, and at least five years of experience in specific applications and in design, development, and test. A background in product development is a plus. According to Evans, the number of developers currently working on IoT applications has increased 34 percent since last year to just over 6.2 million today, and the increase of development for mobile devices, up 14 percent since last year, has led to smartphones being the most commonly connected IoT platform. Rasalan says, “Most developers target multiple mobile platforms, so secondary platform targets differ and often include competing platforms. When we look at initial targets by region, 2.2 million developers target Android first in the Asia Pacific region versus just over 500,000 for iOS.” He says the numbers are reversed in North America. Growth in India and China is predicted to keep the Asia Pacific developer population the highest globally for the next few years. SKILL BOOSTERS The current mismatch and shortage of engineering talent in the region has resulted in more companies creating programs aimed at upgrading the skills of engineers and related tech disciplines. The India Skills Report 2016 projects a 20 percent jump in hiring activity in telecommunications and allied services, with a gain of 100,000 jobs in the next three years. However, the report, a joint initiative of PeopleStrong, Wheebox, CII, LinkedIn, and the Association of Indian University, suggests the “employability” of these engineers remains a challenge and the increase in the need for engineers means that the time for making engineers “job ready” has been reduced. Google has been very aggressive in recruiting developers; it plans to train two million developers in India for its Android platform. Google’s plan is to connect with about 2,000 universities, and train about 4,000 faculty staff to reach more than 250,000 students in these universities every year. (Apple announced in May that it would open a development accelerator in Bangalore, India’s technology hub, to support iOS app developers.) Rohde & Schwarz says it plans to “skill up” its tech talent in its new building in Changi Business Park in Singapore, which will serve as a global hub for research and development and production of its test instruments. Cambridge, UK-based ARM Holdings, which recently announced that it was being acquired by the Japanese electronics giant, Softbank Group, has signed agreements with the Global University Program Alliance in China, Rockchip, a China-based IC design company, and Atmel, a subsidiary of Microchip that gives ARM active involvement in China’s national university and college curriculum reform. Wayne Wu, general manager, Atmel Shanghai, says the program is designed to increase student enrollment and “foster their future career development and create a new pool of talent for our industry.” Under the terms of its acquisition, Softbank says it plans to at least double ARM’s employee headcount in the UK and increase the headcount outside the UK over the next five years. ARM recently listed more than 200 openings for tech professionals globally, including in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Taipei. Google recently listed 55 job openings across the Asia Pacific, mostly for software engineers to test, field deployment, network, and systems engineers. Singapore is a key hiring target for young engineers for Google, which says it is looking for “talented students” from Singapore to join its 12 week engineering internship program, which takes place in Australia. Google says it would also welcome engineers from across the world with deep ties to Singapore who want to come home. When Oracle said earlier this year that it had 2,000 job openings in India, it also announced plans to train more than 5,000 Indian students every year to staff its nine regional software and technology incubation centers across the country. Last year, Microsoft established the IoT Industry Development Center with Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs to accelerate IoT development. Since then, Microsoft has created a certification program to assist Taiwan device manufacturers become Microsoft Azure Certified. HTC Corp. is also inviting selected start-ups from around Asia to apply for a program called Vive X to further the developments in virtual reality (VR) technology. HTC, which says it will share its expertise in VR and its technology with the start-ups, has invested $100 million in the program. A new research report, Economic Survey of Korea, published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, seems to recognize a similar issue. The report’s bottom line analysis: “Strengthening the R&D links between academia, business, and government are required” if the country is to sustain its labor force. Both IBM and SAP are also advancing their programs to train university students in India. Dell has opened its first dedicated IoT lab in Singapore to serve the Asia Pacific region, and is recruiting (mostly software development and systems engineers) in Shanghai, Taiwan, Malaysia, India, and Australia. The new IoT facility was launched in collaboration with Intel. Cisco Systems recently listed 273 job openings for software engineers, almost 100 of them for Bangalore, Shanghai, Beijing, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Other Cisco openings in the Asia Pacific call for specialists in IoT, Big Data/analytics, Cloud, and IT. Linear Technology Corp. has opened its third semiconductor test facility in Singapore, its headquarters location in Asia, and plans to expand its technical staff in the new operation. DIGITAL INDIA In an effort to retain its technical talent, Infosys has developed a program called Compass, which allows current Infosys employees to explore new job opportunities within Infosys rather than look outside the company for a job change. Infosys says the announcement of the program and a registration site resulted in more than 6,000 requests from employees in three hours. Initially, Compass was made available only for all Infosys employees in India, but Infosys plans a phased rollout of program for the entire company. Similarly, Wipro recently said it would promote 5,600 of its top performing employees and that it has created a new employee appraisal system called Performance Next, designed to give employees regular feedback on their performance. Another upside development in India is that the Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology (MAIT), whose members include Intel, Microsoft, and Lenovo, believes the IT hardware sector could create 400,000 jobs over the next five years if estimated demand reaches 30 million PCs annually entirely through domestic production over that period. The MAIT study estimates 300,000 of the jobs will be in component manufacturing over the five years. To make that happen, however, the MAIT study suggests that India’s differential tax duty structure introduced in 2015 for mobile phones and tablets be extended to desktop personal computers and notebooks to encourage domestic manufacturing of IT products. MAIT has been pushing for policy reforms, including an exemption from an excise duty for parts, components, and sub-assemblies that go into the manufacturing of PCs. On the downside, India’s vaunted startup community is now fighting a funding crunch that seems to be having an impact on hiring and retaining tech talent. Some startups have cut their technical staffs while others have withdrawn job offers made to students at the Indian Institutes of Technology in Delhi, Mumbai, Roorkee, and Guwahati. Pay hikes are also down among startups, as are job offers to executives from outside India. IMBALANCE IN CYBER JOBS AND SKILLS Globally, many companies and government agencies are competing aggressively for cybersecurity specialists. “With more threats comes more jobs,” says Barclay Simpson, a corporate recruitment consultancy. “The increase of cyber security risks has led to a thriving job market,” the London-based company says in a new report. India’s National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), working with the Data Security Council of India (DSCI), launched the NASSCOM Cyber Security Task Force last year to develop a skilled workforce to build and promote India as a global hub for security services and solutions. Since then, NASSCOM has projected employment opportunities in India in this sector at about a million technical professionals by 2025. To help fill those slots, NASSCOM, working with the DSCI and the security software firm Symantec, launched National Occupational Standards, a program aimed at creating a pool of certified cybersecurity professionals in the country. It covers 10 cybersecurity job specialties. Symantec also is offering scholarships to 1,000 women seeking cybersecurity certification by SSC NASSCOM. Singapore Telecommunications Limited is taking similar steps to enhance the cyber skills and preparedness of businesses and governments in the Asia Pacific by creating the Singel Cyber Security Institute. Bill Chang, chief executive officer for group enterprises at Singel, says that based on his research, more than 85 percent of the companies in Singapore do not have robust cyber response plans, and have not created the opportunity to conduct realistic drills to test such plans. “This is why we’ve stepped up to the plate.” Under the program, Singel will train new IT professionals in basic cybersecurity skills, and work with experienced cybersecurity professionals to enhance their skills. Accenture, a global professional services company, has opened its own cybersecurity center in Bangalore. Bill Phelps, managing director and security lead for Accenture Operations, says there’s a demand for “elite talent” in cybersecurity globally, particularly in the commercial sector. He says the plan is to offer a broad range of cyber defense services, providing “access to scarce security capability” through its teams of security and industry specialists as well as university and ecosystem alliance partners. The new Cyber Defense Platform will be a cloud-based as-a-service security platform. Phelps says, “Clients need to work with partners whose skills are vast enough and integrated enough to handle more frequent, complex and severe cyber threats.” AUSTRALIA NEEDS SKILLS Boosting engineering and IT skills has become a key government mission in Australia, and it’s being led by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Like many other areas of the region, Australia is coming up short in recruiting the skills it sorely needs to move the economy forward. At last count, 75 percent of Australia’s fastest growing industries require engineering and science-related skills. Software engineers top the list of the country’s tech skill requirements. Australia’s Department of Employment has projected 14,600 new job openings in the information and communications technology (ICT) industry for software and applications programmers will from 2014 to 2019. Universities are not able to keep up with meeting the demand for these jobs slots in the country, essentially forcing company’s and other organizations to augment their engineering staffs from around the globe. Employment of telecommunications engineers in Australia is expected to grow strongly, but with only about 10,400 telecommunications engineers in the country, opportunities are limited in some areas. The same is true of computer network engineers, which, at 24,300, represents one of the largest populations of technical professionals in the country.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Google Hangouts Cancelled Posted: Aug 17 2016, 8:40am CDT | by Noel Diem, in News | Latest Business News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Google quietly announced this week that Google+ On Air hangouts will no longer be available in four weeks. The users will be asked to use YouTube Live instead of the older platform. Google first debuted its livestreaming feature for Hangouts in 2011, long before a lot of other companies even hopped onto the bandwagon. The feature was, for at least a while, exclusive to select celebrities.  Don't Miss: The Black Friday 2016 Deals on Sale Now Since 2013 and the debut of YouTube Live, however, more and more users started switching platforms and Google Hangouts wasn't the success that it once was. Now, Google has finally decided to combine the two to streamline the procedure. Any existing events scheduled to happen on Hangouts on Air via Google+ will now happen on YouTube Live. Hangouts on Air will still exist, but they won't be connected to Google+, which means they will probably just die a slow death.  According to Venture Beat, to use Hangouts on Air with YouTube Live, you should follow these steps:   Go to Live Streaming Events in Creator Studio. Click "New live event." Select "Quick" (using Google Hangouts On Air). Give your live stream a title. Click "Go live now" or enter in details to schedule your event for later. Use Hangouts to broadcast live. Recorded events will continue to be available on YouTube and the only remaining Google+ link will be available on your event content in the Activity Log. Google began dropping the Google+ requirements across all of the products and the process will continue in the coming months.   You May Like The Author Noel Diem Noel passion is to write about geek culture.     Advertisement Leave a Comment Share this Story Follow Us Read the Latest from I4U News Facebook Working on Censorship Tool to Enter China 2 hours ago Microsoft Saves $10 Million Annually through Carbon Offset 1 day ago, 8:20am CST IBM Launches Watson IoT Consulting Solutions 1 day ago, 3:26am CST Zuckerberg sells $95 Million in Facebook Stock: Forbes 1 day ago, 1:47am CST Facebook Creates 500 Jobs in UK 1 day ago, 9:22pm CST Black Friday and Thanksgiving Store Hours for All Stores 25 minutes ago Gravity Sensors can Predict Earthquakes Faster than Current Methods: Study 38 minutes ago Amazon Black Friday TV Deals 2016: Best 4K, Smart, OLED and Bargain TVs 43 minutes ago MIT’s New Nylon Muscle Fibers Could Lead to Real-Life Westworld 53 minutes ago Kia Recalls 71704 Sportage Crossovers in the U.S. 1 hour ago Toyota Recalls 744000 Sienna Vehicles in US 1 hour ago Black Friday Marijuana Deals for Inaugural Green Friday Promotion 1 hour ago Your Best Bet for Hatchimals on Black Friday?

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Google loses appeal against Russia’s Android antitrust ruling Strike three against Google as it's ordered to comply with Russia's antitrust rules. by Jennifer Baker (UK) - Aug 17, 2016 2:52 pm UTC Login to bookmark 72 Google’s appeal against an antitrust ruling over its Android operating system in Russia was tossed out by Moscow’s ninth arbitration court on Wednesday. The ad giant was fined 438 million rubles (£5.25 million, $6.85 million) by the country’s competition watchdog, the Federation Antimonopoly Service (FAS) last week. FAS found that Google had imposed restrictive contracts on mobile phone manufacturers who want to use its Android operating system, forcing them to pre-install other Google services, while blocking those of rivals. As well as the fine, FAS ordered Google to mend its ways and floated the possibility of an out of court settlement. However, the two sides failed to strike such a deal, FAS said on Tuesday. Today, the court rejected Google’s appeal against binding obligations to resolve the case. FAS spokesperson Elena Zaeva said: The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the court of first instance in force, confirming the legality of the decision and the requirements of FAS Russia. The prescription period set by it must be fulfilled by Google in its entirety. We are confident that the requirements create fair conditions for effective competition in the rapidly growing market for mobile applications. This is the second appeal Google has lost in the case, which dates back to a February 2014 complaint lodged by Russian search firm Yandex. Google said, in response to questions from Ars, that it wouldn't comment until its legal team has fully reviewed the ruling. FAS said in a statement last week, that Russian law applied to all companies operating in the country. Google is also facing almost identical charges in the European Union. Brussels' competition chief Margrethe Vestager sent a Statement of Objections to the company in April, stating that it had abused its dominant position by imposing restrictions on Android device makers. Separately, FAS initiated proceedings on alleged price fixing for iPhones earlier this month. Preliminary investigations showed that 16 of the country’s major retailers have been involved in price fixing since the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus came on the market in October 2015. The antitrust watchdog has suggested that such a coincidence might be a result of coordination by Apple, or resellers interpreting “recommended” prices as obligatory.

Do These 10 Things First Google's productive teamwork--and the psychological safety fueling it--is extraordinary. Here's 25 years of research on what makes it safe for people to show up and do their best work. By Michelle Reina Michelle Reina, PhD is co-founder of Reina, A Trust Building® Consultancy, a global firm specializing in transforming workplaces through trust. @DrMichelleReina Co-founder, Reina, A Trust Building® Consultancy@DrMichelleReina WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement You want the people in your team to work together so well the results they produce would make even Google jealous. Where do you focus first to get that level of teamwork? Inc's Editor-at-large Leigh Buchanan looked into this for you. Turns out the no. 1 dynamic driving Google's productive teamwork is psychological safety. Psychological safety only happens in high trust environments. So -- what would it take for you to build trust? Support your people to consistently practice the 10 behaviors listed below. (Just so you know, these behaviors aren't drawn from a hat. They're sourced in statistically significant team trust data and research my company has compiled over the course of the past 25 years.) Use this data. Take it to heart. Build trust as your competitive advantage, and give Google a run for its money. Focus on helping your people: 1. Talk with - instead of about - one another when they have issues and concerns. Gossip is the #1 killer of trust in teams. While hard data backs this up, does it really need to? You struggle to trust people who talk about you, right? And, you struggle to trust people who talk about others. Those who gossip with you gossip about you, etc. Model a hard line against gossip. Support people to be courageous in bringing up tough issues with one another - directly. 2. Give constructive feedback in ways that are timely and well intended. No one enjoys hearing that they've wasted their time. Even less enjoyable? Hearing how you should have done things differently...weeks after the fact. Encourage the practice of giving timely, constructive feedback. 3. Address breaches of trust with people directly. Disappointments, let downs, and hurts come with the territory of relationships and teamwork. Yet, when trust breaks down, people typically do the opposite of what's needed to restore it. They pull back and talk about 'what happened' with everyone but the person who caused them pain. Support people to work through breakdowns constructively and rebuild relationships that have become strained. I'll be straight with you. This takes work. But the payoff is worth it. 4. Point out risky situations or areas of caution to one another. That's not in my lane. Not my job. Not my problem. These silos and limited thinking do not contribute to a trustworthy environment. People have got to have one another's backs. In this, it's not just the safety of your teams at risk. It's the viability of your company. 5. Provide coaching on performance when needed. Your people want to contribute at the highest levels. They want to know they're making a real difference. Help them. Teach them how to encourage one another to stretch. To discover what they're each capable of. To tap into one another's potential and deepen collective expertise. 6. Communicate openly and honestly with one another. Seeing a trend? Communication is the most critical aspect of trust. It's also the form of trust people are least likely to experience in their own teams. If you can get your people talking with one another - openly, fluidly, and honestly - you can build a powerful edge. 7. Strive to build supportive and productive relationships. Work for the win-win, instead of with blinders on. Consider what others need, instead of what will make 'me' look good. Pay as much attention to people and relationships as 'the work.' Are these behaviors the norm in your team...or the exception? 8. Speak constructively to one another. There's new talk about how it's okay - healthy, even - for teammates to yell at one another when they disagree. We may have a new economy. A new pace. A new rigor. A jarringly crowded new marketplace. But the terms of civility and respect have not changed. Don't allow your people to disrespect one another. Period. 9. Tell the truth. Truth telling can be hard. Especially when that truth is challenging, or when people worry about how others will take it. So, they spin the truth. Or share a partial or comfortable variation of it. Trustworthy action can't take place without accurate information. Help your people make a shift. Support them to tell their truth - the truth according to their experiences, perceptions, and expectations. 10. Openly admit, take responsibility, and learn from mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. And everyone knows that everyone else makes mistakes. Lead your people to embrace what they already know: that they're each human and fallible. Make it safe for people to admit misjudgment, leverage the insight, and celebrate gains. Authenticity breeds camaraderie. Camaraderie fuels trust. Trust produces results.

MARKETING The Myths You're Being Told About SEO Could Cost You SEO has changed massively in recent years. But with some of those changes comes the rise of myths about the modern way things should be done. Don't believe the hype. By Stacey MacNaught Stacey MacNaught is a digital marketing professional based in the U.K. @staceycav Director, Tecmark@staceycav WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The SEO landscape has changed phenomenally in recent years. Since I started in the industry 7 years ago, my day-to-day activities have completely transformed. The way it was could be summed up quickly: ·      Choose your  keywords ·      Get your target page in order (relevant title, keywords in the copy etc) ·      Acquire a large volume of (often anchor text rich) links to that page Acquiring links could often mean paying for them. And sponsored links worked. You'd enjoy big rankings on big keywords with relatively little effort. It didn't matter if your links were marked as sponsored. It didn't matter if your links featured in advertorials. Fast-forward a few years and that sort of activity is more likely to land your website a long term Google penalty than any kind of return on your investment. Today, pages have to have value for users, not just keywords stuffed in content. And you have to earn links. There's more emphasis on PR style techniques to acquire links to assets you've created on your website. Today's SEO consultant has to be a more rounded marketer than the SEO consultant of 2009. So yes, things have changed. But one of the consequences of this change is that SEO appears to have become a channel often positioned as one that is less accountable for delivering direct ROI. And there's now so much hype and talk around elements of SEO that I'd consider, at best, misunderstanding and at worst, complete misinformation. Here are 2 of the myths we're constantly hearing about the modern SEO landscape: 1. Keywords Don't Matter Anymore Back in 2009, if we had a local service provider who wanted to rank for the following set of keywords, we'd create a page for each: ·      Plumbers in Oldham ·      Plumbers in Manchester ·      Plumbers in Rochdale ·      Plumbers in Bolton Or we might create separate pages on a travel website to rank for things like: ·      Cheap holidays ·      Low cost holidays ·      Discount holidays We did it because with a separate page, you could fine tune your page title, meta description and page content perfectly around that one specific targeted phrase. It worked. Did this represent a good experience for the users? Probably not. The reality is that the content on all those pages would be incredibly similar. But the modern day extreme opposite of this is doing away with keywords altogether in favour of "topics," and letting Google itself determine which keywords are the most important for you. Don't get me wrong. Topics are critical. And keywords shouldn't ever be one per page these days. Keywords with similar meanings will be grouped together on a page that is predominantly designed to answer the user's query. But keyword research is still a vital part of the process. Consider these queries in the USA: ·      iPhone accessories (Searched up to 30,000 times per month in the USA) ·      mens shoes (Searched up to 70,000 times per month in the USA) ·      Cheap car rental (Searched up to 30,000 times per month in the USA ·      Car rental Washington DC (Up to 1,700 searches per month in the USA) If you supply those products or services, you absolutely need to know the way in which people are searching for them. And yes, people are using voice search and more natural language when performing search engine queries. But we still see significant volumes of potential customers using short keyword queries. What should you do about it? Do not ignore keywords. Google is much better these days at handling natural language queries and can deal with synonyms and things like that in a much more efficient way than ever before. But do not rely on Google using your page content to determine your most important keywords. In the way you always would have done, carry out your keyword research first and optimise elements of your page the way you always would have done. But don't create unnecessary pages and assign single keywords to a page. Group by topic, but research by individual phrase. This is explained incredibly well in this Moz Whiteboard Friday by Rand Fishkin. 2. Rankings Don't Matter Anymore I can't imagine that there's a business owner on the planet who would choose not to take a top 3 position for the biggest keywords in their industry. While there's plenty that has changed about Google, one thing still holds true. If you appear in the top 3 for a well searched keyword, you're going to get traffic. And if that keyword is incredibly relevant for the services or products you sell, you're giving yourself a real shot at getting customers. So of course rankings matter. If thousands upon thousands of your potential customers are searching certain phrases each month while looking for your products, of course you want to appear highly for those phrases. What has changed over a few years for me is how many different keywords I look at. Rather than a list of 5, 10 or 15 big keywords, I might now focus on hundreds including a solid mix of short headline queries, medium tail queries and longer tail ones too. I wouldn't ever want all my eggs in a single basket! But I still pursue rankings (albeit in a much less aggressive way than in 2009) and I still report on rankings for my clients.  More to the point, there's still a direct correlation between core rankings and revenue driven by SEO. I don't see that changing any time soon. What should you do about it? Track and monitor rankings. But don't just target a small handful of phrases. Make sure you have big groups of target keywords incorporating headline, medium tail and long tail queries. And don't forget about keyword data available to you in Search Console. Understanding the keywords already driving traffic, regardless of whether they're already in your rankings tracker or not, helps you to consistently identify new keyword opportunities. The Modern Approach SEO these days is more like technical  skills meet digital PR. There's a much bigger emphasis on user experience and interaction with your site and on ultimately being the best answer for a user's query. How we acquire links has changed. There's a huge crossover with PR as you see SEO consultants creating research pieces, compelling content, opinion pieces and big interactive content pieces designed to gain coverage and links on merit (albeit with a lot of promotion required). But users still make keyword based queries in search engines. And while we see more "long tail" queries and more question style queries in many industries, we do still see huge volumes of searches for short headline phrases.  So yes, let's embrace the change in this field. Let's enjoy the fact that we're pushing one another to create bigger, better, bolder content. But let's not forget that some of the keyword research and rankings tracking of old still very much has a place in 2016.  The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

Signing up is as easy as entering a code the app automatically texts you based on the number assigned to the SIM in your phone, and it does nothing more than video. It’s good at that. Built on WebRTC, early users aren’t noting much failure during streams. Duo is excellent at being simple (it only has three images in the App Store!) and stupid, but it’s still a mistake. Read any of the many ‘reviews’ of Duo and the same narrative becomes clear: Duo is cool, but why do we need or want it? It’s 2016 We’re beyond all of this ‘simplicity.’ FaceTime’s timing was spot on. If it weren’t limited to iOS devices, I doubt Duo would exist. Unfortunately, Apple didn’t have the foresight to make it widely available, so here we are. Skype — save for Microsoft ignoring it for a few years — also beat everyone to the punch. It was the first well-known app to have it all: chat, video, and a presence everywhere. Had Microsoft not acted like it was dead on arrival, I really doubt we’d be talking about Duo. And then Hangouts arrived, and we had a solid option for both Android and iOS. It also had chat and video functionality, and was a solid entry into for one thing we’ve been asking for: a catch-all chat app. Save for FaceTime, which is a darling because it had advantageous launch timing and comes standard on the most popular device in the US, we’re not concerning ourselves with one-trick apps. Users constantly ask for more from Hangouts and Skype, and those are just the largest players on the field. Now that Messenger is a standalone entity, it’s also adding value beyond simple chats. What’s the purpose? Cross-platform video chat apps are nice, don’t get me wrong — but was that a pain-point for users? More critically, Google already has Hangouts, which does video chat just fine. Google will gladly tell us that Hangouts is meant for enterprise, while Duo is designed for individuals. That’s a fair assessment of its own product lineup, but ultimately inconsiderate of our wants and needs. Hangouts has a 4.5 star rating in the App Store and 3.9 stars in the Play Store (Android users seem really upset that Hangouts no longer merges SMS, and I can’t blame them. Duo has 4.1 stars). It’s a known entity, well regarded with a pretty happy fanbase. And thats why Google Duo should have simply been a re-working of whatever issues Google thinks Hangouts has. The narrative that we need an app for work — and another for our home life — is just wrong. Duo is pretty sensational at video chat, but it’s inferior to Hangouts in so many ways. There’s no Web presence, no way to do group calls and Knock-Knock only works for contacts. Oh, and you can only use it on one device. Duo breaks all the wrong molds In addition to Duo, Google will (someday) release Allo, its search-enabled chat app. Again, it has features Hangouts would benefit from, but will be its own app. When it comes to communication, I don’t want to think about how to get hold of someone. I just want to do it. That’s why Hangouts and Messenger work so well. I lead a charmed life in that regard as an iOS user: FaceTime is baked right into contacts. But even if I preferred Hangouts to FaceTime — and I do — I don’t want to consider which app to use to communicate with people. I’d much rather open an app and get to chatting. That’s where Google screwed up with Hangouts ditching SMS, and where it’s going wrong with asking us to use Duo just for video chats. If all of this Duo-Allo stuff were simply a ground-up refresh for Hangouts, I really think we’d be lauding it as the best communication app available. Instead, we have to first ask ourselves how we want to get hold of someone, and then decide which app is best for that purpose — the one we already have, or the shiny new thing with a few non-essential bells and whistles. Unless Google can make a really compelling case for Duo down the line (and I don’t overlook that, because most didn’t see Facebook Messenger becoming a bot platform like it has), I’ll stick with what’s in front of me — and everyone else I know.

SUBSCRIBE How to solve duplicate content local SEO issues for multi-location businesses It can be difficult for businesses with multiple locations to craft unique, rich content for each individual location page, but columnist Joy Hawkins has some advice for how to do just that. Joy Hawkins on August 17, 2016 at 10:20 am More Earlier this year, I wrote an article on Moz that talked about one of the issues big brands run into with SEO. Brands with tons of locations sometimes have a hard time coming up with unique content for each of their locations and often use a template format that gets the majority of them filtered. So, what can multi-location businesses do to help improve their location pages and avoid the filter? Following are four tips for putting together rich, unique location page content. 1. Use testimonials I came across a great example of this with insurance companies. Currently in Houston, TX, Allstate Insurance has 146 offices, State Farm has 173 offices, and Farmers Insurance has 232 offices. Each one of these offices has a unique location page, but they are all technically competing with each other for the same exact keywords, like “auto insurance Houston” or “brand name + Houston.” This is what causes Google’s filter to kick in, and the majority of the pages will get filtered from the search results for being too similar. One way that Allstate has combated this is by incorporating a service called Get 5 Stars, a service that automates the process of collecting and publishing customer reviews. Get 5 Stars asks customers for a testimonial via email, which gets auto-published onto the website. The agent then has the ability to post responses to the reviews, which also get published. These agents could improve this by including more (natural) keywords in their responses. So instead of, “Thanks Bob!” put something like, “Bob, it was our pleasure to help you save money on your auto insurance! I hope you enjoy driving your new Toyota Prius and choosing us as your insurance agent.” This process results in a ton of rich content that is unique for each location. When you look up a branded search for “Allstate Houston,” you’ll see the agent pages occupy the top six results and get the gold stars on their organic presence as well. Allstate’s website as a whole manages to snag the top nine organic spots before the rest get filtered and Google starts showing third-party sites like Indeed and Yelp. In comparison, Farmers Insurance only manages to capture the top four spots for “Farmers Insurance Houston” before Yellowpages.com shows up in the fifth spot — and most of these results are not going to the actual location pages in Houston. Denver looks even more impressive, with Allstate’s website taking up the top 19 search results for “Allstate Denver.” In contrast, State Farm only gets the top four results for “State Farm Denver.” 2. Write out driving directions Another great way for big brands to make their location pages unique is to write out driving directions to the office. Often, people just link to Google Maps, but writing out driving directions gives you unique content that is also helpful to users. It also allows you to get more local signals on your website, like this personal injury lawyer in El Paso does: 3. Create employee bios This is another easy way to get rich content on the page and make it different from the other locations. Adding detailed employee bios gives you a natural way to include keywords (by listing their expertise) on the site, as well as geographic areas. This realtor does a great job of doing that with his staff: 4. Add photos Most big brands fail to add multiple photos to their location pages. I often see just a single generic picture, whereas users (and Google) would love to see multiple. Photos of the inside of the office, the outside of the office, parking, neighborhood, building, employees, employees serving customers, products/services, accomplishments/awards and events are often missing. This is a huge missed opportunity, since photos allow you to add descriptive keywords in the image file name and alt-text. Jake’s Fireworks does a decent job of this on their location pages by adding several photos showcasing the inside of their store and displaying their products. They could improve further by making the image file names more descriptive. Instead of kentwood1-web.jpg, they should instead go for file names like jakes-fireworks-kentwood-mi.jpg, which would get their city name and keyword side by side. Final thoughts Do you have other methods you use to keep Google from filtering your location pages? I’d love to hear about them, so please reach out to me on Twitter or Google Plus!

(AAPL) Drops Routers Google Shop Launches: Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Partners With Best Buy Co Inc (BBY) View All Posts Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) FaceTime video calling application is popular among iOS and Mac users. That’s enough to make it a target for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), a company that has turned tormenting Apple with competing products into an art form. Source: Google On Tuesday, Google began rolling out Duo, a cross-platform video calling app that takes on FaceTime while offering something Apple’s original lacks: cross-platform compatibility. Google is promoting a number of features that it feels make Duo a compelling reason to switch from FaceTime, Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Skype or video chatting on Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger. Duo originally was announced at this year’s Google I/O conference, and officially began rolling out on Aug. 16. Google says it will be live worldwide over the next few days. In a blog post promoting the release, Alphabet laid out the reasoning for why someone would want to drop a video calling application they may have been using for years in favor of Google’s new app. Duo Features Among Duo’s key features are its simple interface and the lack of a required account to use it. Callers need only enter their own phone number into the app to get started, then punch in the phone number they want to call. Obamacare: The Beginning of the End Speed and reliability also are emphasized. Google says Duo intelligently manages video calls to keep connections reliable without stuttering or dropped calls. Duo adjusts video resolution on the fly based on the available bandwidth and seamlessly switches between Wi-Fi and cellular connections. Security and privacy are spiked out, with Google noting that Duo calls feature end-to-end encryption. Incoming calls must originate from a phone number in your Contacts list, so there is no fear of unexpectedly encountering the face of a salesperson on an incoming Duo video call. In other words, the pain points of video calling are eliminated. Especially those that a less tech-savvy user might find frustrating. Cross-Platform Is the Key But the primary selling point of Duo (and the part that Apple is going to hate) is that Google Duo is cross-platform, working with both iOS and Android. That eliminates one of the biggest complaints about FaceTime, that it only works between Apple products. By making the Duo app available for both iOS and Android, the users of the two largest mobile platforms can make video calls to each other without having to worry about setting up accounts or knowing each others’ user names. They just need to know their telephone number. There are plenty of mixed-platform families out there who would love to have an easy way to make video calls between devices without having to jump through the hoops of setting up accounts on Skype or Facebook. The ease of use and engineering Google has put into making Duo calls the most reliable possible are an added bonus. Apple doesn’t monetize FaceTime, but its default iOS apps including FaceTime are all part of the iPhone experience. And the last thing Apple wants is to have another Google app supplant one of its own on an iPhone. Google Duo also will be quashing the halo effect. Up to now, someone with an iPhone who wanted easy, on-demand video calling capability with a friend or family member would result in a little more incentive toward that other person also buying an iPhone. Google Duo can achieve the same capability regardless of whether one or either parties owns an iPhone or an Android smartphone. So that incentive disappears. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace Apple Inc.

Ford Motor Co., aiming to put fully autonomous vehicles into the economy by 2021, announced that it’s doubling the size of its office in Silicon Valley to 260 people and investing in four companies that are key to building self-driving cars. The carmaker’s move follows more than $1 billion in investments made by Detroit-based General Motors Co. in a pair of California technology companies earlier this year to keep up with Google’s autonomous-car project and Uber Technologies Inc.’s ride-hailing business. While the old-school mechanical engineering remains in the Midwest as does low-skilled factory work that hasn’t moved to Southern states, these investments show Detroit carmakers have realized that they must go to the nation’s technology center to find the software expertise needed to make the autos of tomorrow. Traditional automakers now directly employ hundreds in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Palo Alto-based Tesla Motors Inc. “The shift to California is undeniable,” said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab consulting firm in Orange, California. “The technological development for autonomous vehicles and intelligent cars will continue to be done in Northern California because that’s where the knowledge is.” Tough Realities Ford and GM, racing to stay among the technology leaders, face a few tough realities. Companies like Google and Uber threaten to upend the industry by turning car-owners and drivers into passengers who simply pay for a ride. And even though the carmakers and state of Michigan are developing tech talent, Silicon Valley is still ground zero for the people who write code, create driverless algorithms and come up with new business models for mobility. Ford has invested in Velodyne Lidar Inc., which develops the laser-based sensors that are the eyes of self-driving cars, and 3-D mapping company Civil Maps, both in California. The Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli-based computer vision and artificial intelligence designer, and it reached a licensing agreement with Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC. Its founder, Dr. Sheila Nirenberg, has developed a machine-vision platform that Ford said can bring humanlike intelligence to self-driving cars. “We came to Silicon Valley -- there are a lot of great places around the world -- but the ecosystem here is just unbelievable,” Fields, standing outside on a bright, sunny day, said to reporters. “It’s like a bazaar of ideas, and everybody’s open.” Smooth Cruise GM CEO Mary Barra last year took her top leaders to visit tech companies and venture capital firms to get their thoughts on fostering innovation. GM went on to buy a 9 percent stake in Lyft Inc., a competitor to Uber, for $500 million. GM also spent more than that to buy San Francisco-based Cruise Automation, which writes the software for autonomous driving. Owning Cruise, which has grown from 40 employees to 100, has helped GM hire people who may not have been interested in working for an automaker, Mike Ableson, GM’s vice president of global product planning, said in a June interview. Some people want to remain the California environment but also have the stability of a large company, he said. Similarly, Ford’s announcement may have been intended to present the maker of F-150 pickups look like an “exciting destination for human talent,” Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research note. “There is at least a perception in the market that all the cool kids are going to places like Uber,” Google, Tesla or China, he wrote. Ford and other automakers “want to change this.” Michigan Man Michigan isn’t giving up on talent, Governor Rick Snyder said in a June interview. Snyder, a former chairman of Gateway computers and founder of investment funds, pointed out that Alphabet Inc.’s Google announced in May that it will open a self-driving car research center in suburban Detroit and that Harman International Industries Inc., the audio and automotive technology company, opened its North American headquarters nearby. Amazon.com Inc. has opened a tech center in downtown Detroit. Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Snyder said one of Michigan’s biggest challenges is getting the word out that it has great resources for technology companies, especially in the automotive industry. With the University of Michigan focusing on software and technology development, the talent and education system is available for any company that wants to take advantage of it, he said. The university’s Mcity provides carmakers and tech companies with an ersatz town to test driverless cars. Plus the state has much lower costs of living and doing business than California, especially with real estate prices rising ever faster in Silicon Valley. “Our challenge is that we don’t do particularly well with telling people,” Snyder said. “That’s something we should do more of, especially when it comes to talking about Detroit’s comeback.” While the Detroit region has bounced back, its unemployment rate is 5.8 percent compared with 4.1 percent in the San Jose, California area, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More Marketing Snyder in June unveiled Planet M, an advertising and marketing campaign to tell technology companies that the state has the education and industrial base to be home to new automotive technology research and startups. The tagline is, “Michigan. Where big ideas in mobility are born.” To compete with the Golden State, Michigan plans to make an autonomous-drive test track out of a 330-acre industrial site near Ypsilanti, where Rosie the Riveter built B-24 bombers during World War II. One selling point: Tough winters and many potholes make the site a better proxy for the imperfect world of driving than California’s decommissioned Navy base in Concord. “If you look at any place in the world, we have highly developed building blocks,” Snyder said.

Audiences from around the world were glued to their screens as they watched the chaos unfold, left to wonder at the unimaginable horrors experienced by those trapped inside. Little was left to the imagination when, in 2015, a controversial virtual reality simulator titled 08:46 put users in the perspective of an office worker trapped in the World Trade Center. Supporters of the experience see it as a path towards empathy for the victims and as an immersive recreation of a pivotal historical event. Detractors feel that it is an unnecessary indulgence in horror and tragedy. But where do we draw the line? Is it acceptable to watch real falling bodies on the news, but morally questionable to undertake immersive fictional re-creation? Now that virtual reality (VR) is here, and here to stay, this sticky ethical dilemma is only one of many moral conundrums to come, especially in regard to the use of this revolutionary technology with children and teens. VR may have unprecedented value to education, but that very same power must be managed responsibly. Since humans learned to control fire, technology has proven to be a double-edged sword, and VR is no exception. The same flames that gave us light, warmth and hot meals burned down entire cities. VR is not new; but its use in the past 50 years has been restricted to high tech labs in military, academia and industry. But today the technology has finally reached the masses. In an address to the VRX conference in San Francisco, noted game developer and tech wizard, Jesse Schell predicted that over 8 million VR gamer headsets will be sold in 2016. Facebook purchased Oculus Rift, presumably laying the groundwork for a future where friends and family will interact in rich virtual spaces. All the major players, including Microsoft, Sony, Samsung, Google and an HTC and Valve partnership are jostling for the consumer headset market. This means homes and school now have easy access to a technology that, less than a decade ago, seemed limited to the sci-fi realms of Star Trek and the X-Men. Virtual Reality in Schools Mark Suter teaches computer science and game design at Elida High School in Elida, Ohio. He’s been experimenting with VR in his classes as part of a project piloted by Seattle-based foundry10, a privately funded research organization that creates partnerships with educators to implement, research and explore the various intersections of emerging technologies and learning, including VR. Suter’s students both evaluate and design content for VR, and the 9/11 experience was available for those who wanted to try it. “I didn’t ask students to participate, but some wanted to try, and a few of those were emotionally moved,” Suter said. “They stated, ‘I knew it happened, but I never thought about what it was like for the people at the office that day. That felt horrible.’ This is both a flag to be watched closely for ethics violations, but also a testament of the platform’s immersion potential.” And the technology’s potential for good is vast. It has already been used to help with autism, improve personal financial management, treat PTSD and manage pain. More and more news outlets, including the New York Times, are adopting immersive journalism, where news stories can be experienced through VR. As an educational tool, VR might prove transformative. Google Expeditions allows students to take over 100 virtual journeys from ancient Rome to the surface of Mars. It might also have a big impact on social emotional learning (SEL), as VR’s unique ability to produce empathy recently led Wired magazine to explore its potential as “the ultimate empathy machine”. Addressing a persistent anxiety, Suter used Samsung Gear’s Public Speaking Simulator to successfully prepare a few nervous students for class presentations, reporting they felt “much more calm” during the live delivery. Tim Neal, who teaches communication technology at Orangeville District Secondary School in Orangeville, Canada, is also part of the foundry10 project and, like Suter, has implemented VR extensively in his program. He collaborated with English teachers at his school to use Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, a playful bomb defusing game that encourages communication and critical thinking. Neal also reports a great deal of success with Tilt Brush, a powerful 3-D art creation tool. A talented artist in his class was normally reluctant to share her work, but had a transformative experience using Tilt Brush. “When I’m using VR all I can see is my artwork, I’m fully immersed,” she said. “I can’t see if other people are watching, even though I’m sure they are, and I don’t care because I’m in my own world making my own art with no restrictions.” Neal has used Tilt Brush with Syrian refugees and developmentally delayed students and notes that it “transcends language and ability and has no restrictions with regards to insecurity or ability.” Suter is also enthusiastic about Tilt Brush. “Students described it as having the feeling they had when they were a kid playing in a sandbox, with no stresses or concerns. It was therapeutic,” Suter said. “Students that were normally reserved and quiet found that the inhibitions of being embarrassed or doing the wrong thing suddenly vanished. They were moving and creating in the middle of a classroom full of their peers, where five minutes before they would have hesitated to raise their hand to give a response.” Ethical Considerations These early classroom adoptions are promising, but it might be advisable to test the waters with our virtual toes, before hurling headlong into the digital ocean. Lisa Castaneda, co-founder and CEO of foundry10, tempers her wholehearted belief in the potential for the technology, with a mindful approach towards ethical implementation. “We need to be conscious of the psychological and physiological impacts. It is very easy to say, ‘Oh, the graphics on this one aren’t so good; they know it isn’t real.’ That is likely true, but the fascinating thing about the brain is that it still responds as if it is real. As educators, we need to be very aware of this and mindful of what experiences we choose to share with students.” The body’s response to the virtual as if it were real is known as the illusion of embodiment. In a recently published article, researchers Michael Madary and Thomas K. Metzinger from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany review a series of ethical considerations when implementing VR. The illusion of embodiment may provide VR’s greatest value to education, but also lies at the heart of its ethical implementation. Madary and Metzinger believe that VR is not just an evolution from television and video game screens, but a revolution that will have an enormous social impact. In their paper, they claim that: VR technology will eventually change not only our general image of humanity but also our understanding of deeply entrenched notions, such as “conscious experience,” “selfhood,” “authenticity,” or “realness.” The implications, then, are not only social, but drive to the core of our being by affecting the very notions of identity and self-perception. It’s important to remember that many current VR uses in schools, like Google Expeditions, are not interactive VR, but simply 360-degree video experiences. In these cases, students experience immersive 3D pictures or panoramas, but do not deeply interact with the content. The illusion of embodiment is a product of interactive content and motion tracking, where users can alter and affect their environment and engage with others who share their virtual space. Headsets like the Vive and Occulus Rift fall under this latter category, but it won’t be long before most, if not all, consumer oriented VR technology will be completely immersive and interactive. Madary and Metzinger lay out ethical guidelines for VR research, but also make recommendations for everyday public use. Educators and parents should be aware of these before children and adolescents take the plunge, and it’s worth adding that they also apply to adults. These five areas are by no means exhaustive and in some cases they are speculative, but they address some of the more pressing issues to look out for as VR headsets enter day-to-day use. 1. Long-Term Effects and Prolonged Exposure What little research has been undertaken on the psychological and physiological effects of VR has occurred in clinical settings and has only studied short-term use. There is no research on the long-term effects of VR on children, nor on the effects of prolonged exposure. It’s not uncommon for school-aged children and adolescents to spend dozens of hours a week consuming media and playing games, but what will happen when VR goggles are added to the mix? Madary and Metzinger flag addiction, manipulation of agency, unnoticed psychological change and mental illness as some potential hazards of prolonged exposure. This is of particular relevance to youth because their developing minds and bodies may, for better or worse, be deeply susceptible to the power of immersive technology. Presumably, uses in schools would be limited in time and scope, but the availability of high-end gear at home will raise all the same questions about prolonged levels of use and addiction that have dogged the internet, video games and other media, especially since VR is likely to merge with all of the above. Associations like the United States Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics do not currently have guidelines in regard to VR. In the meantime, parents and teachers should curate content, limit exposure and monitor responses and reactions. 2. The Impact of Environment on Agency and Behavior Research in psychology supports the notion that our surroundings, both social and structural, exert subtle effects on our behavior. Our senses regularly relay environmental cues that inform and affect our attitudes and reactions. This sensitivity to context has been identified in some of the most famous studies in psychology, including the Stanford Prison Experiment and Milgram’s obedience experiment, where participants were unconsciously coerced to apply what they thought were painful electric shocks to fellow participants. This is of enormous consequence to VR, where users operate in immersive artificial environments. As the German researchers note, our day-to-day surroundings are relatively stable, but we don’t really know how our minds and bodies will respond to diverse and rapidly changing virtual worlds, potentially leading to any number of unintended consequences. The results may be positive or negative, but as it stands, research on specifics is scant to non-existent. As our responses are better understood, virtual worlds can be deliberately designed for specific outcome, but this is also ethically loaded. On one hand, environments can be created to encourage empathy, joy, fulfillment and any number of pro-social emotions and outcomes. But where does our true nature end and the engineering of emotions begin? Also, and more nefariously, these contexts can also be manipulated to give users the illusion of being in full control of their decisions, but subtle and unnoticed environmental cues can unwittingly lead us to alter our political and religious views, and open new horizons for commercial exploitation. This, of course, could disproportionately impact children, perennial targets for advertisers due to their susceptibility and the influence they exact on their parents. There is also the danger of what is termed social hallucination, or the perception that we’re having rich social (albeit virtual) interactions with an avatar guided by artificial intelligence. Again, these false friends can reshape our views and influence how we spend our hard earned dollars. Once again, there is a need to proceed with caution in order to make sure the use of the technology with students and children falls on the side of good. Research, awareness, regulation and monitored use would all prove beneficial. 3. Aggravating Preexisting Psychological or Emotional Issues No two human beings are alike and most people regularly cycle through a wide range of complex emotions and mindsets. Disposition has a significant effect on how individuals receive media, and has complicated studies that explore the effects of media, as content and media will affect different people in different ways at different times. In some cases, VR use might trigger or aggravate preexisting and latent emotional or psychological disorders. For this reason, it is important to screen individuals before subjecting them to VR experiences, and monitor them while the sessions are in progress, as what might be emotionally productive for one may prove devastating to another. It’s also important to contextualize sessions with debriefs and discussions. “A student’s past experience and knowledge level also has an impact,” Castaneda said. “Even with things such as being up high in the air, seeing a large creature, or being under water, we’ve seen situations with students where those triggered anxiety and discomfort. So, although most educators would not put their students in really intense scenarios in VR, from an ethics standpoint, it is really, really important that educators be aware of some of the psychological research.” As previously mentioned, VR has already proven effective in treating PTSD, for one, and will likely be leveraged to produce further mental health benefits. The potential for VR to assist rather than aggravate, however, hinges on its judicious use based on empirical research. 4. (Un)Reality and Diminished Real World Interactions Although we currently inhabit diverse and absorbing media ecologies, few will argue with the notion that the real world still has much to offer. There are many advantages or “enhancements” to interacting socially in virtual environments, but existing technology is still only an approximation of the nuanced, multisensory tangibility of real life. We have evolved to receive the subtleties of scent, body language, tactility and the vast complexities of the natural world, and their loss or imperfect substitution may have detrimental consequences. For example, limited and potentially superficial social interactions in virtual spaces — such as reductive “liking” on Facebook — may become normalized and we could, theoretically, collectively lose the knowledge and memory of the intricacies of face-to-face communication. However, on the plus side, these virtual and online spaces also enable reclusive, anti-social, geographically isolated and disabled or disfigured individuals to partake in a rich social life that may be otherwise limited or unavailable. Madary and Metzinger speculate that heavy VR use may lead to dissociative conditions like Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder, a sort of dream-like state that produces a sense that either ones body or one’s surroundings are not real. They write that “Heavy users of VR may begin to experience the real world and their real bodies as unreal, effectively shifting their sense of reality exclusively to the virtual environment.” VR’s capacity to blur the real and the unreal can also deepen the propensity children have to mix-up fantasy with reality. “The most advanced headsets are not recommended for younger children, for a variety of reasons,” Castaneda said. “One of the most interesting cases that we’ve seen that younger children have a difficult time separating virtual reality from reality. They struggle to frame, particularly at first, the fact that they just saw dinosaurs and are now in the living room.” Castaneda advises that it’s important to err on the side of caution and deliver age-appropriate experiences, which should be discussed beforehand, contextualized and include a debrief upon completion. 5. Privacy and Data Gathering Data and education have a tentative relationship. The prospect of granular assessment using all types of data from keystrokes to heartbeats holds the promise of better understanding and responding to the individual needs of our students. Yet, that same data can fall into the wrong hands, now or later, with life-altering consequences. The relationship between data and privacy is quickly emerging as one of the defining social questions of the 21st century, and VR will likely take the debate to the next level. The further we merge with the virtual world, a condition that is now upon us, the more data we will release, often without our knowledge or consent. As social networks and the Internet become virtual, 3-D spaces, we will more closely identify with and be identified by our online avatars, whose use and misuse raise complex questions about identity, ownership and privacy. Madary and Metzinger use a basic case to offer a small glimpse at the brewing legalities pertaining to our online selves: “Say a user creates an avatar that is similar but not pixel-for-pixel identical to another user’s avatar. Where precisely should we draw the line between theft and acceptable similarity?” Where, indeed? As is already the case, technology is advancing faster than legal systems and legislation can keep up, and pervasive VR use will only widen the gap. Another privacy concern forwarded by the German researchers is that, if our online avatars mirror our real-world movement and gestures, these “motor intentions” and the “kinematic fingerprints” of our unique movement signatures can be tracked, read and exploited by advertisers or other predatory entities. Virtual environments will respond to our body language, occasioning laser precise targeted advertising and “neuromarketing,” including the strategy of putting us in the very ads and commercials that we are exposed to. Of course, it’s not all gloom and doom, because these same technologies can help read our moods for more productive mental health counseling and treatment, as well as enhance health care in general. It also may help realize the elusive dream of truly differentiated instruction, making learning a happier and more equitable place. Rather than sparking a new moral panic a la comic books, rock ‘n’ roll and video games, the use of VR in homes and schools calls for ongoing awareness and responsible citizenship, enlisting the democratic process to ensure that appropriate, research-based and ethical laws and regulations are in place to enhance the benefits and minimize the potential harm of VR technology. As in all instances of media use, parents and teachers should apply media and digital literacy best practices. This includes being involved, mindful and informed of their children’s media use, encouraging critical thinking and frequently dialoging about their experiences. “We feel that the most interesting and creative uses of VR will come from this open, engaged dialogue between educators and their students,” Castaneda said. “If we are willing to allow ourselves to think a bit more broadly, VR may be a viable avenue for true shifts in how we think about learning.” Explore: Big Ideas, Digital Tools, virtual reality Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Show Comments (1) Hide Comments Fred I.

 Russia fails to reach settlement with Google in Android case Reuters Aug. 16, 2016, 10:39 AM 35 facebook linkedin twitter email print Android mascots are lined up in the demonstration area at the Google I/O Developers Conference in the Moscone Center in San Francisco Thomson Reuters MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's state anti-monopoly watchdog FAS said on Tuesday it and Alphabet Inc's Google had failed to reach an out-of-court settlement in a case over Google's Android operating system, Interfax news agency reported. The watchdog last week imposed a 438 million ruble ($6.85 million) fine on Google after ruling last year that the firm was abusing its dominance by requiring the pre-installation of certain applications on mobile devices using Android, following a complaint by Russia's Yandex. Google had appealed the ruling while FAS said an out-of court deal was possible should Google admit to violations of antitrust laws and pay a fine. "The talks with Google on the issue of the settlement agreement have come to nothing. Now it's up to the court to draw a line under this case," Interfax quoted Elena Zaeva, head of FAS's Department for Regulation of Telecommunications and Information Technology, as saying. Zaeva was quoted as saying a court would hear Google's appeal on Wednesday. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

By Agamoni Ghosh August 17, 2016 13:34 BST Render presentation of HTC's 2016 Nexus phoneAndroid Police A new leak has provided insight into the specs of one of Google's 2016 Nexus models, the HTC Marlin. An AnTuTu benchmarking test has been revealed on Twitter by famed smartphone tipster Steve Hemmestoffer revealing the core tech specs of the HTC Nexus Marlin. The tweet reveals the specs of the larger of the two Nexus 2016 models, HTC Marlin. It shows the Marlin will have a Quad HD resolution with 2560 X 1440 pixel density with an Ardeno 530 GPU. The device will run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 processor with a 4GB RAM and 32GB ROM. The phone will have a 13-megapixel rear camera along with an 8-megapixel front camera. It will also run on Android 7.0 Nougat and most likely be the first device along with Sailfish to have the new Android OS on board. The Marlin, which is the larger-screened model, will have a 5.5-inch screen while the Sailfish will have a 5-inch screen. Sailfish is rumoured to share most of the features of Marlin with the exception of battery capacity and screen size. Both handsets are also likely to have identical designs. There has been no official confirmation from Google on the release of the two handsets but some recent reports have hinted towards an October release. At the same, Google is slated to announce the Android 7.0 Nougat, the final preview version of which was released last month. #HTC #Google #Nexus #NexusMarlin https://t.co/xKQxhccR29 pic.twitter.com/YkxJ1CYA9h— Steve Hemmerstoffer (@stagueve) August 17, 2016 More from IBTimes UK Google Nexus Sailfish spotted in wild?

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About November 23, 2016 Google’s New OS Will Run on Your Raspberry Pi 37 Comments by: Cameron Coward August 17, 2016 According to reports from Android Police and ZDNet, you may soon have a new operating system from Google to run on your Raspberry Pi. Details are still extremely sparse, the only description on the GitHub page is “Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System)”. But, here’s what we do know: The new OS, called Fuchsia, will be based on Magenta, which is in turn built on LittleKernel. That means that, surprisingly, Google will not be using a Linux kernel for the new OS but something more like an embedded RTOS. Although Google is targeting embedded systems, the possibility of being able to run it on a desktop has been mentioned, so it may not be too minimalistic. Google’s Travis Geiselbrecht has named the Raspberry Pi 3 specifically as one system it will run on, and said that it’ll be available soon. But, it seems Google is aiming to make it run on a variety of ARM devices (both 32 bit and 64 bit), as well as 64 bit PCs. This is a direct effort to compete against other commercial embedded operating systems that are currently available, and especially on IoT devices. If you’re eager to see what this is all about, you can follow Google’s quick start recipes and see what you can come up with, although details are still sketchy enough that we’re just going to wait a bit.

Pandering. Report comment Reply Cuvis says: August 17, 2016 at 7:17 am Sure it does. = is for assignments, == is for comparisons. Report comment Reply daid303 says: August 17, 2016 at 11:28 am Really? http://linux.die.net/man/1/test Report comment Reply KDM says: August 17, 2016 at 11:20 pm Don’t forget the order of precedence for operations. == {logical comparison} is done before addition. So, as written, the result of the logical comparison between Purple and Fuchsia will be added to the value of Pink. I wonder if the result of the comp can be cast to the type of Pink? Are “TRUE” or “FALSE”, or 1 or 0, type COLOR safe? Report comment Reply Harsh says: August 18, 2016 at 12:33 am No relational operators have higher precedence than compound operators but less than arithmetic (C++) Report comment Ryan says: August 18, 2016 at 12:37 am eh? what language? addition comes before ==. Long before == in C, C++, Java and = in VB. Also = in R. Almost never does the logical comparison take precedence over addition. But, you sure do look smart making that correction.

Report comment Reply Marcus says: August 17, 2016 at 5:21 am exactly. Not like there’s not already a “Google OS” (Android) that runs on Pis. Or a general lack of OSes to run on the Pi. The selling point here is that this makes the Pi usable for time-critical control. So RTOS is definitely what should be the most important part of the title, not “Google’s new OS”.

At least until someone comes up with a ready made image for the Raspi, and there’s actually something that this OS can do better than others. Report comment Reply JWhitten says: August 17, 2016 at 6:32 am Sounds to me like a play to take their OS market private and proprietary. Report comment Reply lwatcdr says: August 17, 2016 at 6:54 am I can see that. I mean posting it on GIT hub and providing source is a great way to make something private and proprietary. And they are using the MIT license and look how that crippled the adoption of X windows in the free software space. Report comment Reply Traumflug says: August 19, 2016 at 1:16 am You do know how this works, don’t you? 1. Publish enough to get something barely working. 2. Make some crucial bits on top of this proprietary. 3. Deny patches making these crucial bits less crucial or even replacing them. Report comment Reply Bill Gates says: August 17, 2016 at 7:26 am WIll it have analytics built in from the ground up? How about telemetry? How about monetization? micropayments? Data collection? these are the important things in an OS, everything else is secondary. Report comment Reply M1DLG says: August 17, 2016 at 9:39 am Last decade wants it’s book of trolling jokes back. Report comment Reply radiusmike says: August 17, 2016 at 6:03 pm On an RTOS? Telemetry, analytics are not relevant. Most important is the capability to switch tasks quickly, avoid toxic buffer overlead, and nowadays, handle security with minimal overhead. Think Stuxnet and Siemens PLCs. Report comment Reply Bill Gates says: August 17, 2016 at 7:37 pm Nope. Switching tasks is good, but those tasks should be telemetry, analytics, or tasks related to monetization. User tasks are secondary. Security is very important too. All the analytics, monetization and micro payments should be encrypted. User data is not important and can be in the clear to comply with the law. The users application should not have too much overhead. Analytics, payments, and telemetry take precedence. Spare cycles can be used for user tasks , running in low priority mode. Report comment Reply Neuntoter says: August 17, 2016 at 9:00 pm ZOOOM!

Oh your too busy living under a bridge. Report comment Reply DaveW says: August 17, 2016 at 9:17 am This could be interesting but I no longer trust the Google motto “do no evil” as they are (probably unintentionally) trying to get everyone to be dependent on them and their cloud. The long term results of such a concentration of knowledge and control could be very bad indeed for many people. If this is a decent open source RTOS – great. If it is just another way for Google to vacuum up data – beware. Report comment Reply Whatnot says: August 17, 2016 at 9:40 am You got that abandoned motto wrong which is “don’t be evil” and is quite a different thing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil But yes though, it’s better to not get too involved into google. Report comment Reply Chris Arney says: August 17, 2016 at 4:36 pm Google’s end game is to get all of us on the internet so we will see they ads. You can see it as their motivation in almost everything they do. I look forward to finding out what their application is for this, but I bet it’s so you can see their ads more.

Report comment Reply jawnhenry says: August 20, 2016 at 10:32 am There will never be a true RTOS–unless ‘real-time’ means ‘glacial’–for the Raspberry Pi. There is no support for machine-level instructions, and particularly not machine-level interrupt instructions. 144 KHz for the fastest bit-banged square wave using a 1 GHz processor? Give me a break. And some other processor, while you’re at it. Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

There are some tangible things you can do to get on the road to having your own app. If you want to turn an app idea into a successful business, this article is for you. By David Gewirtz for DIY-IT | August 17, 2016 -- 11:27 GMT (04:27 PDT) | Topic: SMBs Image: File Congratulations! If you've found this article, you've found the key to all your dreams of success. That's right, by acting before midnight tonight, you, too can become an app billionaire simply by clicking your heels together three times and saying, "There's no place like..." Nope. I'm just kidding with you. Pulling your leg. Yanking your chain. Messing with your head. We're talking about software. You don't even need to be wearing shoes. You could, in fact, wind up a billionaire without ever putting on a tie or wearing lace-up shoes. It's just a matter of having the right idea, and the world is your oyster. DIY-IT Project: Software business crash course David Gewirtz was a director of the Software Entrepreneurs' Forum, an executive at Symantec, had the title of "Godfather" at Apple, and ran an award-winning tech company for 20 years. Now, he's here to help you start your own software business. Buckle up! Read More Can we be serious for a minute? Just having an idea is not enough. There are real opportunities in software development, but there are realities as well. In this article, I'm going to talk about both. It's going to have a tough love feel about it in some places, but I'll point you to great resources as well. About two years ago, I wrote an article called, "So you have an app idea and want to make a bajillion bucks." I thought it was going to be a simple reply to a reader's questions. It turned out to be the homing signal to everyone with an idea, a massive sense of entitlement, and a complete lack of experience. I can't begin to tell you how many letters I get that begin with "I have no money and no programming skills," make the claim to an idea that's "bigger than Facebook," and end with the demand that I either write the app for them, team up (for free, of course) and write the app for them, or hire someone for them so the app can get written. These folks had a fantasy that they could whisper an idea to someone and somehow, magically, become rich. The world doesn't work that way. In this article, I'll show you how get into the app business, but there are no guarantees. It's a very crowded market and there are a lot of other folks with the same dream. If you want to succeed in creating an app, you have to get past the idea that you're the anointed one with the golden special gifted-from-the-gods app idea, and that everything should drop into your lap automatically simply because you want it to. We all have ideas. There are a billion iPhone and another billion or so Android users out there. Do you really think you're the only one who came up with an idea like yours? The odds say, "No." I know, it hurts. The great science fiction writer Robert Heinlein coined an acronym, TANSTAAFL, that perfectly describes this: there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. Just having an idea isn't good enough. You have to do a lot more to succeed. Fortunately, success is possible if you're willing to do the work. With that, I'm now going to reveal the secret that will let you unleash your true potential for success in the app business. The secret: learn to program. If you work for a company with a budget to hire programmers, if you're an investor who has developed business plans and spent years funding software investments, or if you're a business professional with years of experience putting together teams, then you don't need to be a programmer. If you're one of those folks, you know the score and are busy proceeding with developing your plan, doing market testing, assembling a team, considering offshore development, and all the rest. If you're not a tech industry insider with years of experience, you're going to have to learn to program. That's the secret. Don't freak out. Learning to program is actually pretty achievable. The good news is that Apple and Google have gone to extreme lengths to set up systems that make the barrier of entry into their app marketplaces almost absurdly low. They want you to develop your app. They really, really do. After all, your success is their success, because they get a cut of every app they sell. Although neither Apple nor Google will give you a million dollars to turn your idea into reality, they have cleared a path for your success. But you have to meet them halfway there. You have to do some of the work. Apple and Google have created simplified program development environments, made tons of tutorials available, and made access to their customers astonishingly simple. You can join Apple or Google's development program for under a hundred bucks, create an app, and publish it to the world. That's right folks, for less than the cost of some Apple Watch bands (and not even the ludicrously expensive ones), you can set yourself up to build and sell apps. Pitfalls and traps to avoid Before I go into some of the really constructive things you can do to learn to program and build your own apps, some cautions are in order. If you are thinking about hiring developers, don't. Even the best programming managers, with years of experience wrangling teams of programmers, tend not to get projects done on time and on budget. You, with no experience? You're just a victim waiting to be stripped and gutted. Don't go there. Don't think you can save money by hiring someone in a third world country to do your work for you. Even at discounted rates, if you have an app idea and no experience, the surest way you can fail (and do so spectacularly) is to pay someone else to write your code. What's Hot on ZDNet #WeAreNotWaiting: Diabetics are hacking their health, because traditional systems have failed them Microsoft's SQL Server Next: What's under the covers The cloud price war continues: Amazon cuts its cloud storage prices, again VMware turns to sci-fi writers to explain virtualization If you're willing to learn to program, that's great. But avoid those 5-figure programming bootcamps. Some can be as costly as a traditional degree, but without the advantage of earning a universally accepted credential. You also don't need to go to a traditional college to learn programming if all you want is to develop an app. I respect the value of traditional education. But you don't need to go into debt for a decade and earn a college degree to develop an app or two. There are many readily available, comparatively inexpensive (or even free) alternatives. Keep your money and spend some time with YouTube. Learning to program isn't really that hard. Sure, it takes time, energy, dedication, and a willingness to put up with frustration. No one can remove that truth, or do that work for you. If you do the work, you will probably be able to put an app on the app store. Learning to program If you don't know how to program, there is an incredible selection of free resources out there. Watch some YouTube videos. Read some books. Download the development environments. Do some tinkering. Learn. So how long will all this take? That's like asking how long it takes to learn to play the guitar. Being able to make some music is very different than becoming the next Eddie Van Halen. There's a range of skill involved in any creative endeavor. But I'll tell you this. I've taught college-level programming classes on and off for the past two decades. I currently teach programming at the University of California. Nearly all my students become pretty good entry-level programmers in one semester, or about 16 weeks. Almost everyone gets his or her first program written in just a few weeks. You do not have to be in a college class to learn to program. The secret about learning to program is that it involves what education theorists call "constructivism," which is basically learning by doing. The only way anyone, whether in a college course, a programming bootcamp, or just watching YouTube videos, will learn to program is by actually writing programs. So do that. If you work on it intensely and use the tools Apple and Google provide, you could create your first app in just a few weeks. It won't be Facebook, of course. But it will be an app. There's no magic to this. It's hard work, like anything else. Once you're done programming, you'll have to do all the supporting activities, from describing it, to creating graphics, and so on. I've actually written a road map to all of this, from how to sign up to the development programs for iOS and Android to how to submit your first app. Dive in and follow the instructions and you'll be up and running. Anyone can publish an app. That's an amazing statement. Until the iOS and Google app stores existed, that availability and access to a global audience was impossible. But if you have a computer, some time, some discipline and patience, and are willing to work, you can get your app into an app store. Then, it will be up to the users whether or not it's a hit. But you'll have an app. And you might even make a few bucks. So that's the secret: work hard and do your own programming. Whether your dream of billions in easy money will ever come true, well, when you buy your first yacht, let me know. You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Go Back With Backspace by Google for Chrome By Martin Brinkmann on August 17, 2016 in Google Chrome - Last Update:August 17, 2016 8 Go Back With Backspace is a new browser extension for the Google Chrome web browser by Google that maps back to the Backspace key in the browser. Google removed backspace back navigation functionality in Chrome 52. Back then the company stated that only 0.04% of page views used the backspace key on the keyboard to navigate back. The core reason for removing the functionality, besides lack of use, was that some users happened to hit the Backspace key accidentally. Some after filling out form data on sites losing the data in the progress. Google made the decision to remove the mapping from the backspace key instead of implementing a safeguard (are you sure you want to go back if form data is filled out on a page). Third party browser extensions like Back to Back were created as a response to bring back the functionality. Additionally, users could make use of the Alt-Left Arrow shortcut to go back, but that was not a suitable alternative for many users who were used to hitting the backspace key to go back. Go Back With Backspace Go Back With Backspace is an official extension for Chrome by Google. It brings back the backspace back navigation mapping that Google removed. The extension brings back the functionality for the most part. Google notes that it won't work on internal pages starting with chrome:// as well as other special pages. Basically, any page that ships internally with the browser does not support the backspace back navigation functionality. This is true for all backspace mapping extension that bring back the back navigation functionality though. Google notes that the extension has to install a tiny bit of code on every page in order to capture backspace key events. This code does not record anything or submit it to Google. Verdict Go Back With Backspace adds the same functionality to Chrome that other extensions such as Back to Back add. Functionality is identical, and the only difference is that one is an official extension by Google, while the others are not. Now You: Where you affected by the removal of the functionality in Chrome?

Both the smartphones are manufactured by HTC and Google might release them in September along with Android 7.0 Nougat. It is already known fact that Google is working on two new Nexus smartphones for the year 2016 dubbed as the Nexus Sailfish and Nexus Marlin. Both the smartphones are manufactured by HTC and Google might release them in September along with Android 7.0 Nougat. Today, a new leak from AnTuTu Benchmarking reveals that the Nexus Marlin will feature a 5.5-inch Quad HD display which might be an AMOLED panel. The smartphone will be powered by a Snapdragon 820 chipset with support for Adreno 530 GPU for handling graphic intensive tasks. The leaked AnTuTu Benchmark smartphone is running Android Nougat Manufacturer Release (NMR1). It is quite surprising that both the 2016 Nexus smartphones will be using the same chipset- the Snapdragon 820, as per the latest GFXBench report of the Nexus Sailfish. The smartphone might arrive with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, however, Google might release a higher end variant of the smartphone with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage. The smartphone is also expected to come with USB Type-C port, bottom firing speaker on the bottom and the fingerprint sensor will be located in the same place. Both the Marlin and Sailfish will feature a 12MP camera and an 8MP front-facing camera, which is same as last year's Nexus 5X and 6P. Google is still keeping the things wrapped and gearing up for the launch. That said, there is no official word from Google regarding the launch of both smartphones.

However, there is a new development on the two upcoming handsets - that neither will be Nexus phones, but will both be exclusively Google-branded. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The Nexus line of phones from Google has been relatively successful thus far, which is why the 2016 additions have been highly anticipated. However, it seems like that search giant has other plans for what were expected to be the 2016 Nexus phones -- the HTC Sailfish and the HTC Marlin. According to NDTV, Google is gearing up to release its own set of smartphones, specifically branded under the company. And while the publication claims that the handset will be released in September and to various different locations, the specific markets and dates are still unclear. Furthermore, it was claimed that the two Google devices would come in 5-inch and 5.5-inch variants, as well as 32 GB and 128 GB options. This sounds exactly like the two Nexus phones, the HTC Sailfish and the HTC Marlin. However, the publication is adamant that a pair of Google-branded handsets will be released next month. BGR adds that both units will run on Android 7.0 Nougat right out of the box, as well as Google Assistant. Other details are still unknown at this point, but both units are expected to be premium devices that will provide a great overall experience. And because of its expected release, the units are expected to go head-to-head against Apple's iPhone 7, which is also expected to release in September. However, it is also likely that the Google smartphones will hurt Samsung's sales. Earlier this year, there were also reports that a Chinese company would be making the 2016 Nexus phones. It is thereby possible that the HTC Sailfish and the HTC Marlin, which are manufactured by a Taiwanese company, will be the Google branded devices. This could change the whole game of Google, despite the rumors having spread so vastly and quickly -- so much so that they were taken as truth.

Android 7.0 Nougat: 6 helpful new features to try first Video Rapid review: Hasselblad True Zoom Moto Mod During an hour-long Hangouts web chat for the media and select IT professionals, Google today provided a glimpse of some of the new security features in its upcoming mobile OS, Android 7.0 "Nougat," which should be available on Google Nexus devices "in a few weeks," according to the company. The online briefing wasn't meant to be exhaustive. Instead, it provided a top-level look at a set of new security and management tools in Android Nougat and Android for Work. Here's a breakdown of some of the most notable security improvements in Nougat, for Android users and IT administrators. Android Nougat 7.0 platform-security enhancements 1. Direct boot and stronger encryption Android Nougat users who encrypt their phones will no longer have to enter a security code after a reboot and then wait for their devices to restart in order to use core native features. Google apps including the phone and alarm will work on encrypted phones after a reboot, but the passcode will be required to access data using those apps, such as a phone contact list. Google New file-based encryption works at a more granular level to better isolate users and profiles in Android. And hardware-backed encryption keys are required for all new Android phones that run Nougat. 2. Stronger MediaServer and platform hardening  Google caught a lot of flack related to flaws in its Android MediaServer components that enabled the Stagefright attacks earlier this year, and it says it strengthened the MediaServer in many ways. For example, Android 7.0 Nougat gives attackers who might breach MediaServer access to fewer permissions, according to Google. [Related: Android, iOS bug bounty biz is booming] Android Nougat also requires that all devices support verified boot, so corrupt phones or tablets won't start at all, or will only grant access to "safe" apps and services after they start, Google says.  3. App security and abuse prevention Apps on previous Android versions used to be able to share user-granted permissions with other apps much more easily, according to Google. In Nougat, the company cracked down on permission sharing between apps. And apps with device admin permissions in Android Nougat can no longer prevent users from uninstalling them or change users' PIN, passwords or codes to lock them out of their devices. 4. 'Seamless' Android updates  When Nougat software updates are available for new phones, users can choose to download and install them in a separate on-device partition, so they don't need to stop using their phones or tablets during the process. The next time they reboot their phones, the new software will auto-install much more quickly than in the past, according to the company. Unfortunately, only new phones optimized for Nougat will have access to this feature.  Google also says it removed the annoying "app optimization" step of the Android upgrade process, so Nougat devices won't be useless for 10 minutes or more after a new OS patch is applied, while apps optimize for the changes. Android Nougat 7.0 corporate-security enhancements Google didn't provide as many specifics about the IT security features in Nougat, but it did offer a glimpse of some of the most interesting improvements. 1. Nougat's 'always-on VPN' An enhanced "always-on VPN" feature lets IT force certain business apps to use a VPN to connect to the web. If a VPN isn't available or can't connect, the apps won't work or share any data.  2. Android 'work security challenge' A "work security challenge" feature lets IT set separate, complex passcodes on users' devices to protect specific work data, using Android profiles, and users can employ simpler PINs or codes to access their personal data. IT can set lock restrictions for specific apps, and admins can choose to use different looking login screens so users visually know when they log into corporate services. 3. 'Work mode' in Nougat A new "work mode" icon in the Android Nougat dropdown menu, which looks like a briefcase, lets user disable all work related apps after hours or when they don't want to be distracted. Google 4. Nougat phone and dialer tweaks The Android 7.0 Nougat dialer component further integrates with corporate systems and directories, according to Google, and users can search both work and personal contact lists from one place. If a business user receives a call from someone in their work directory, their caller ID can be set by admins to notify them that the call is likely work related. Call logs can be separated into business and personal lists. And other UX modifications aim to make it clear when calls or contacts are personal or work related. Google Google also said many of the work-versus-personal changes are meant to serve as a "foundation for a second phone line for business" in addition to a personal line on a single device. In fact, APIs already exist that enable certain VoIP apps to create separate phones lines within a single dialer in Android Nougat, according to Google. 5. QR code provisioning in Nougat A new Nougat feature lets IT admins provision devices that don't support the NFC "Android bump" feature, using a QR code. 6. New remote bug reports and process logging Enhancements to Android's remote diagnostic tools in Nougat give admins more options to request remote bug reports, though in many cases, users must approve the requests for access to potentially sensitive information. Google said it will provide additional details on Android 7.0 Nougat and Android for work when the new mobile OS is released in the coming weeks.

Most reports refer to them as 2016 Nexus devices, while a fresh rumor claims Google will go for Google branding instead. The company is supposedly looking to better position its devices to fight against the iPhone, and the rumored device will have high-end specs and high-quality design. A brand new leak indicates that the phones will indeed have top hardware, matching the specs of some of the hottest smartphones out there, including the Galaxy Note 7 and Galaxy S7 series. DON’T MISS: I can’t wait to see Apple’s silly explanation for the iPhone 7’s camera An Antutu benchmark for the “Google Nexus Marlin” found on Weibo by The Malignant indicates the tested phone packed a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, 13-megapixel primary camera, and 8-megapixel front-facing camera. The handset also has a 2560 x 1440 (2K) display. #nexus #marlin hits on AnTuTu (Weibo) Snapdragon 820??🤔🤔🤔 pic.twitter.com/JvKIpMcVjt — The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 17, 2016 A few days ago, a similar leak was posted online for the HTC Sailfish, which is the smaller of the two. Aside from screen resolution, set at 1920 x 1080 (Full HD) for the Sailfish, the two handsets are identical. The Sailfish leak also included Geekbench scores for the handset: 2158 in single-core and 5355 in multi-core tests. A search for “Google Marlin” on Geekbench produces scores for the upcoming phablet as well. Recorded on June 30th, or well over a month before the Google Sailfish listing was spotted, the test lists 2084 and 4969 in single- and multi-core tests for the Marlin. Credit: Geekbench Recently, HTC documentation submitted to the FCC already confirmed the company is making two new devices for Google, whose user manuals will be found on Google’s Nexus mini-website. Furthermore, the first real photos of the HTC-made phones have emerged online. At this point, it’s probably a matter of weeks until we’re going to see the Marlin and Sailfish become official. October 4th is the rumored release date for the handsets.

Share this on Facebook Tweet this on Twitter Share this on Google Plus Share this on LinkedIn Print this article Email this article Increase size Google, maker of the most ubiquitous mobile operating system in the world, is apparently working on a new one. A project called “Fuchsia”—first uncovered by readers of the aggregation site Hacker News—showed up on the code repository site GitHub on Aug. 12. Fuchsia appears to be a new project from two Google engineers with experience in embedded systems—computer systems that don’t need full-blown operating systems, like a car dashboard or a microwave. The GitHub page doesn’t offer too many clues about the intended use of Fuchsia—there’s just a somewhat cryptic message at the top, saying, “Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System).” According to The Verge, the operating system is based on a piece of code called Magenta, which could be the pink part of the message, although it’s unclear what the purple part is. (Google is also working on a very different project called Magenta, so perhaps the company is just really into pinkish hues right now.) A Google spokesperson confirmed to Quartz this is an active project at the company that isn’t related to either the Android or Chrome operating systems, but wouldn’t share what it’ll be for. And that hasn’t stopped the internet from trying to imagine what it could be. The Verge suggested it could be the long-rumored replacement for both Google’s Chrome and Android operating systems, and readers on Hacker News believe it could be the next version of Android, or for an as-yet-unreleased Google augmented reality device. Whatever it’s for, if it’s for anything at all, we’ll have to wait and see. recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT The Inimitable Effect of Standing on Productivity The Decision-Making Science of Effective Healthcare Life After the Big Bang Making Sense of Healthcare FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

For one, Duo is the fifth in a long line of chat apps after Hangouts, group chat app Spaces, Messenger, and web-based cell service Voice. A soon-to-be-launched sixth messaging app integrated with a virtual assistant, Allo, will debut later this year. Google’s plethora of messaging apps makes chatting unnecessarily complex and exhausting. Users prefer one simple all-encompassing app for messaging. Much like Facebook Inc.’s Messenger platform that is a multifaceted tool for communication—integrating chats, calls, video and even bots now within one interface. Since its debut in 2011, Facebook has worked on the app, adding a gamut of features to make it a one-stop destination for users. That includes giving people the ability to send money, contact businesses, book car rides, play games and more. With the roll-out of Duo, Google further fragments its suite of apps in this space. Duo works only on a mobile device, which means you cannot use it on a tablet, laptop or desktop. Also, it cannot replace other messaging apps like Apple’s Facetime or Microsoft’s Skype. Historically, Google’s communication products have been confused and have fumbled for identity. It has two email services—Gmail, which is the top e-mail service in the US based on unique visitors, according to ComScore, and Inbox (an email app that is not hugely popular); three text offerings, Hangouts, Messenger and the upcoming Allo; and now two video chat services, Duo and Hangouts (which offers texting and video calls). This scatter gun approach is becoming more costly for the company with messaging evolving from a simple way to communicate quickly into the next big technology platform supporting digital commerce, advertising and new services powered by artificial-intelligence. In 2013, Google launched Google Hangouts, a communication platform which set out to fix its chaotic messaging strategy with a single app, including instant messaging, video chat, SMS and VOIP features. Prior to the launch of Hangouts in 2013, Google had maintained several similar, but technologically separate messaging services and platforms. These included the enterprise-oriented Google Talk, Google+ Messenger, and the Hangouts feature of Google+, which allows for group videoconferencing with up to 10 users at once. However, its increasingly fragmented and non-unified suite of messaging offerings has been dwarfed by the success of services such as Facebook Messenger, iMessage, and WhatsApp. Hangouts has languished also because it requires a Google account, unlike its rivals that used phone numbers to grow faster. Hangouts ranked 84th among Android apps in the US in July, based on installs and usage, according to SimilarWeb, a web anaytics company, lagging behind Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Snapchat. According to Google, it has built each app for a different purpose. Hangouts is a cross-platform app tied with Google’s enterprise offerings. Allo, on the other hand, is a mobile app more akin to WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Line. You don’t even need a Gmail account to sign up—just a phone number. Google introduced Allo, along with its video calling companion Duo, at its annual I/O developer conference earlier this year. The company describes it as a smart messaging app incorporating artificial intelligence. Duo is a mobile-only service, at least for now, so what you cannot do is call a friend or colleague from or to a desktop PC or laptop, as is possible on Skype and FaceTime. Google also plans to integrate Duo into its upcoming Allo messaging app, but that is yet to happen. The inability of the company to integrate its chat offerings in one single unified place is a bit surprising given how the search giant shook up the e-mail space with Gmail which gave users exponentially more free storage than had ever been offered. Today it dominates that area. But since then whether it was with Google Voice, which offered a second phone number and automatic voicemail transcriptions or Photos last year, where it combined unlimited high-resolution storage with wildly powerful search, the company hasn’t had much success. Duo, too, isn’t compelling enough despite its “knock knock” feature which lets you see a live video of your caller before you answer. It is likely that your family and friends already use one of the apps already out there for video calls, such as Apple Inc.’s FaceTime, Microsoft Corp.’s Skype, Facebook Inc.’s Messenger, Snapchat Inc.’s namesake app or Google’s own Hangouts. Many people use a combination—an iOS user, for example, might FaceTime with other iPhone owners but use Hangouts to talk to Android phone-using friends. Without text messaging and group chats, though, Duo just isn’t as useful as its rivals that offer that combination, despite its simplicity.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Hangouts to focus on enterprise, still separate from Allo and Duo By R Padla - August 17, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Now that the Allo instant messaging and Duo video calling apps are commercially available, we’re curious as to what will become of Hangouts. We know the app will remain even it still can’t beat iMessage, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp. We were told earlier that the entrance of the Allo and Duo won’t mean the end for Hangouts as Google will continue to offer it as a standalone app. In fact, Google is still regular in releasing updates for the service. Recently, it was updated with better group chat controls, deleted conversation merging, and added video messaging. It began using P2P connections for better call quality. There’s really no stopping Google from offering Hangouts as it still has a lot of supporters. It will be known for the enterprise as the product is integrated with Gmail or Docs–both known as Work products. Hangouts won’t be killed just yet. So you won’t be confused, Allo is used for mobile only. Meanwhile, the Duo is a separate video calling chat. Enterprise productivity will be the focus of Hangouts from now on since it’s integrated with more Google apps ideal for work and productivity like Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Gmail. This means Hangouts is mainly for desktop and ideal for work but on mobile, it’s better if you use Allo and Duo. Google seems to be veering away from all-in-one apps. It makes sense now because as proven by similar apps, such don’t work and there’s a chance of more bugs and issues. Remember Facebook and its instant messaging feature? Facebook did break away from the mold and launched Messenger as a separate app. Maybe that’s the direction Google is headed at so let’s just wait and see.

The problem is so prevalent that computer scientists have identified the existence of a "machine voice," a standardized way of speaking that individuals with accents adopt in the hope of being understood. Researchers even warn about the existence of a "speech divide" that ostracizes individuals whose accents differ from those the machines have been trained on. As is often the case with technology built on large data sets, the problem begins with the input. If you only train your interface using a narrow selection of voices, then it won't know how to respond to accents that fall outside of its frame of reference. According to Marsal Gavalda, the head of machine intelligence at Yik Yak and an expert on speech recognition, academics have been studying the problem since the '80s. Speech recognition's lack of diversity is rooted in data sets collected decades ago "Historically, speech recognition systems have been trained from data collected mostly in universities, and mostly from the student population," Gavalda tells The Verge. "The [diversity of voices] reflect the student population 30 years ago." For example, a project in the early '90s known as Call Home gave students credits to make free, long-distance phone calls. Their calls would be recorded, transcribed, and annotated, then sold as data sets to research teams and computer scientists. "It was the easiest place to collect these samples," says Gavalda. He adds that researchers also collected audio from news broadcasters — but again, this meant selecting only the most neutral accents. There's an easy way to fix this, though: collect more data. Companies like Google have been doing exactly that as their voice interfaces become more integral to their software and hardware, and the internet has made this collection pretty straightforward. As was first spotted by Quartz, the search giant has been using a third-party company, Appen, to corral a diverse array of accented audio samples from the website's users. recruiting at /r/beermoney Contractors for Appen have been posting on a number of subredddits, including those dedicated to part-time work (/r/slavelabour, /r/WorkOnline, /r/beermoney, etc) as well as individual cities. /r/Edinburgh was where the request for samples was originally spotted, presumably to iron out understanding of the underserved Scottish accent. "I'm currently recruiting to collect speech data for Google," reads one typical request. "It requires you to use an Android to complete the task. The task is recording voice prompts like 'Indy now,' 'Google what's the time.' Each phrase takes around 3-5 seconds." Adults are paid £27 ($35) to record 2,000 phrases, while under-17s can record 500 phrases and earn £20 ($26). Neither Appen nor Google would confirm that they were involved in the project, but a well-placed source told The Verge that the search giant regularly collects voice data to improve its services — it's just usually not so visible. We talked to a number of Redditors who completed the task, and asked them about their experiences with voice interface tech. There were regional accents from the UK and America, as well as Indian and Chinese-accented English, with most users saying they'd had difficulty with tech like Siri and Alexa in the past. All said they went through the same process of being directed to a mobile webpage where there was a record button to tap, and a number of phrases to read out. These voice samples were mostly addressed to Google (beginning "OK Google," "Hey, Google," etc.), but some just asked for the names of popular TV shows, toys, and video game (including a number of YouTube channels, like Sky Does Minecraft). Others spanned a range of typical Google searches, including hunting for recipes ("how to make a birthday cake"), understanding idioms ("hey Google, get cold feet"), beating pub quizzes ("presidents in order"), and looking for that perfect karaoke number ("you'll be in my heart just music"). "I need to annunciate a ton and use simple phrases." One respondent told The Verge by email: "[I'm] originally from China, but I've lived in the US for about a decade, so I speak pretty much understandable English. The closest description of my accent would be US northeast with a hint of Singaporean newscaster. However, I do need to enunciate a ton and use simple phrases for applications like Siri and Google Now to work. I can't really 'converse' with my phone." After audio samples are collected by Appen they're annotated by the company's in-house linguists, with longer sentences broken down grammatically, and contextual information added (was the sample recorded on a phone? Inside? Outdoors?). Mark Brayan, the company's CEO, wouldn’t comment on the company’s work with Google, but told The Verge that the firm collects and annotates (a process it refers to as "decoration") audio samples from around the world, with employees able to translate some 130 languages. Brayan says demand for the company's services has increased massively in recent years, especially as voice interfaces become more common and users expect more out of them. "To go from understanding 95 percent of words to 99 percent, the recognizer has to digest infrequently used words, of which there are millions," says Brayan. companies often request audio samples for specific vocabularies Sometimes the company has to produce samples of specific vocabularies, related to, for example, a sport or a hobby. "One of the big challenges is what we call named entity recognition," says Brayan. "That's brand names, product names, individual names, and so on." Companies can ask for specific accents, or they can just say where they're hoping to launch a product and Appen will produce the relevant voices. "So if you're launching in Canada, for example, you need not only the French language but also French-accented Canadian English." Incorporating unrepresented English-speaking accents will be a big step forward for voice interfaces, says Gavalda. "You could argue that the majority of English speakers are not even native speakers." He compares the situation to clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies that only recruited white men. It wasn't until an Act of Congress in 1993 that it became illegal to exclude women and minorities from such vital research. "If you think about it you're developing a of medicine," he says, "So it stand to reason you would make it work equally well with all different types of people." Being able to ask Siri or Alexa questions obviously isn't as important as having access to effective medicine, but it is exclusion all the same. Thankfully, as Google's trawling for accents on Reddit shows, it's relatively easy to remedy. Just collect the audio samples, and let the machine learning systems process them. After all, a computer doesn't really "hear" accents — there are just sounds it recognizes and those it doesn't. It just needs the data. Correction: A previous version of this story stated that "Appen employees" had posted to Reddit. It was third-party contractors Appen had hired who to do so. We regret the error.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Duo is a new simplistic video calling app from Google Listen | Print By James Walker     Aug 17, 2016 in Technology Google has launched its new video calling app Duo, a few months after announcing it at its I/O developers conference. The simple consumer app aims to make it easier to contact people through video calls but critics are divided on whether it will succeed. Duo is one of two new messaging apps announced by Google at I/O this year. Its partner, Allo, a more traditional messaging app, will be launched later in the fall. The two new apps bring Google's total number of communication services up to four, creating a fragmented landscape that could confuse users. Duo itself is designed to be anything but confusing. Google's announcement blog post is filled with the word "simple," indicating what it has tried to create. Duo is supposed to be an app that makes video calling as simple as sending a text message, allowing you to start a call in just a few taps. It’s a 1-to-1 experience that doesn't currently support group calls. It is available on iOS and Android but not on the web or on desktop PCs. To get started with the app, you just need to enter your phone number. You'll then be able to contact all the people you have saved in your contacts list, a similar setup procedure to services like WhatsApp. Once you've added your number, you can call any of your contacts with a single tap. Pressing their name will immediately begin a video call with them. Every call is end-to-end encrypted for security, giving you peace of mind about privacy and the protections around Duo conversations. Duo's most complex feature is Knock Knock, a unique capability that lets it stand it out from the crowd. When you receive an incoming call, you'll see live video of the caller on the screen, before you answer the call. You'll be able to tell what they're doing and why they want to talk. Google says it makes calls feel "more like than an invitation than an interruption," differing from conventional messaging apps by forcing you to acknowledge the caller even if you don't answer. Google Duo video-calling app Google Duo rivals current video calling services including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Skype. Its feature set is nowhere near as extensive as any of these apps though, something Google is betting on for Duo's success. It has crafted the app around doing one job exceptionally well. It wants to "focus" the app on just you and the person you're calling, making the rest disappear into the background. To this end, Google has spent most of its time optimising the app's backend. It has been designed to work flawlessly on even slow networks. Call quality automatically adjusts as your network conditions change. Even when on a limited bandwidth connection, Duo will still try to maintain the call, progressively lowering resolution and quality but keeping your contact accessible. The app can also dynamically switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data, allowing you to keep talking wherever you are. Duo may sound impressive but it has proven to be quite divisive since its unveiling earlier this year. Critics are divided on whether people actually need or want another messaging app, even if it is simpler to use than its rivals. Google already has the far more accomplished Hangouts, capable of text, voice and video calls within a single app. Many users are already well acquainted with Hangouts, a popular chat app for many years. Google has other ideas though. It told Engadget it plans to make Allo and Duo its core consumer messaging apps, gradually converting Hangouts to be more business-centric. Consumers will now need two apps to do what could previously be achieved with one. Suddenly, Duo's simplicity could become a weakness. As Hangouts is gradually phased out for most consumers, users will have no way to make group video calls, or any of the other powerful capabilities of Hangouts. The app may be complex and now viewed by many as excessively large but the features within are popular with users. Google's plans seem to be vague at best. There is no obvious way to move existing Hangouts fans to Allo and Duo, not least because these apps are going to be mobile exclusives for the foreseeable future. Without a proper online presence, the scope of each app is going to be severely limited. Google seems to have accepted that Hangouts has become too big and unwieldy. Rather than try to simplify it, it's just built two more apps though, an approach that may not prove successful in the long-term. It could end up gradually extending Allo and Duo with Hangouts capabilities, worsening the fragmentation even more and making it difficult to consumers to choose which to use.

It's The Future Share on Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Reddit Share on Hacker News Hey, my boss said to talk to you - I hear you know a lot about web apps? -Yeah, I’m more of a distributed systems guy now. I’m just back from ContainerCamp and Gluecon and I’m going to Dockercon next week. Really excited about the way the industry is moving - making everything simpler and more reliable. It’s the future! Cool. I’m just building a simple web app at the moment - a normal CRUD app using Rails, going to deploy to Heroku. Is that still the way to go? -Oh no. That’s old school. Heroku is dead - no-one uses it anymore. You need to use Docker now. It’s the future. Oh, OK. What’s that? -Docker is this new way of doing containerization. It’s like LXC, but it’s also a packaging format, a distribution platform, and tools to make distributed systems really easy. Containeri.. — what now? What’s LXE? -It’s LXC. It’s like chroot on steroids! What’s cher-oot? -OK, look. Docker. Containerization. It’s the future. It’s like virtualization but faster and cheaper. Oh, so like Vagrant. -No, Vagrant is dead. Everything is going to be containerized now, it’s the future. OK, so I don’t need to know anything about virtualization? -No, you still need virtualization, because containers don’t provide a full security story just yet. So if you want to run anything in a multi-tenant environment, you need to make sure you can’t escape the sandbox. OK, I’m getting a little lost here. Let’s back it up. So there’s a thing like virtualization, called containers. And I can use this on Heroku? -Well, Heroku has some support for docker, but I told you: Heroku’s dead. You want to run your containers on CoreOS. OK, what’s that? -It’s this cool Host OS you can use with Docker. Hell, you don’t even need Docker, you can use rkt. Rocket? -No, rkt. Right, Rocket. -No, it’s called rkt now. Totally different. It’s an alternative containerization format that isn’t as bundled together as Docker is, and so it’s more composable. Is that good? -Of course it’s good. Composability is the future. OK, how do you use it? -I don’t know. I don’t think anyone uses it. Sigh. You were saying something about CoreOS? -Yeah, so it’s a Host OS you use with Docker. What’s a Host OS? -A Host OS runs all your containers. Runs my containers? -Yeah, you gotta have something run your containers. So you set up like an EC2 instance, you put CoreOS on it, then run the Docker daemon, and then you can deploy Docker images to it. Which part of that is the container? -All of it. Look, you take your app, write a Dockerfile, turn it into an image locally, then you can push that to any Docker host. Ah, like Heroku? -No, not Heroku. I told you. Heroku is dead. You run your own cloud now using Docker. What? -Yeah, it’s real easy. Look up #gifee. Gify? -“Google’s infrastructure for everyone else”. You take some off the shelf tools and stacks, using containers, and you can have the same infrastructure Google has. Why don’t I just use Google’s thing? -You think that’s going to be around in 6 months? OK, doesn’t someone else do hosting of this stuff? I really don’t want to host my own stuff. -Well, Amazon has ECS, but you gotta write XML or some shit. What about something on OpenStack? -Ew. Ew? -Ew. Look I really don’t want to host my own stuff. -No, it’s really easy. You just set up a Kubernetes cluster. I need a cluster? -Kubernetes cluster. It’ll manage the deployments of all your services. I only have one service. -What do you mean? You have an app right, so you gotta have at least 8-12 services? What? No, just one app. Service, whatever. Just one of them. -No, look into microservices. It’s the future. It’s how we do everything now. You take your monolithic app and you split it into like 12 services. One for each job you do. That seems excessive. -It’s the only way to make sure it’s reliable. So if your authentication service goes down… Authentication service? I was just going to use this gem I’ve used a few times before. -Great. Use the gem. Put it into it’s own project. Put a RESTful API on it. Then your other services use that API, and gracefully handle failure and stuff. Put it in a container and continuously deliver that shit. OK, so now that I’ve got dozens of unmanageable services, now what? -Yeah, I was saying about Kubernetes. That let’s you orchestrate all your services. Orchestrate them? -Yeah, so you’ve got these services and they have to be reliable so you need multiple copies of them. So Kubernetes makes sure that you have enough of them, and that they’re distributed across multiple hosts in your fleet, so it’s always available. I need a fleet now? -Yeah, for reliability. But Kubernetes manages it for you. And you know Kubernetes works cause Google built it and it runs on etcd. What’s etcd? -It’s an implementation of RAFT. OK, so what’s Raft? -It’s like Paxos. Christ, how deep down this fucking rabbit hole are we going? I just want to launch an app. Sigh. Fuck, OK, deep breaths. Jesus. OK, what’s Paxos? -Paxos is like this really old distributed consensus protocol from the 70s that no-one understands or uses. Great, thanks for telling me about it then. And Raft is what? -Since no-one understands Paxos, this guy Diego… Oh, you know him? -No, he works at CoreOS. Anyway, Diego built Raft for his PhD thesis cause Paxos was too hard. Wicked smart dude. And then he wrote etcd as an implementation, and Aphyr said it wasn’t shit. What’s Aphyr? -Aphyr is that guy who wrote, ‘Call Me Maybe.’ You know, the distributed systems and BDSM guy? What? Did you say BDSM? -Yeah, BDSM. It’s San Francisco. Everyone’s into distributed systems and BDSM. Uh, OK. And he wrote that Katy Perry song? -No, he wrote a set of blog posts about how every database fails CAP. What’s CAP? -The CAP theorem. It says that you can only have 2 out of 3 of Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance. OK, and all DBs fail CAP? What does that even mean? -It means they’re shit. Like Mongo. I thought Mongo was web scale? -No one else did. OK, so etcd? -Yeah, etcd is a distributed key-value store. Oh, like Redis. -No, nothing like Redis. etcd is distributed. Redis loses half its writes if the network partitions. OK, so it’s a distributed key-value store. Why is this useful? -Kubernetes sets up a standard 5-node cluster using etcd as a message bus. It combines with a few of Kubernetes’ own services to provide a pretty resilient orchestration system. 5 nodes? I have one app. How many machines am I gonna need with all this? -Well, you’re going to have about 12 services, and of course you need a few redundant copies of each, a few load balancers, the etcd cluster, your database, and the kubernetes cluster. So that’s like maybe 50 running containers. WTF! -No big deal! Containers are really efficient, so you should be able to distribute these across like 8 machines! Isn’t that amazing? That’s one way to put it. And with all this, I’ll be able to simply deploy my app? -Sure. I mean, storage is still an open question with Docker and Kubernetes, and networking will take a bit of work, but you’re basically there! I see. OK, I think I’m getting it. -Great! Thanks for explaining it. -No problem. Let me just repeat it back to see if I’ve got it right. -Sure! So I just need to split my simple CRUD app into 12 microservices, each with their own APIs which call each others’ APIs but handle failure resiliently, put them into Docker containers, launch a fleet of 8 machines which are Docker hosts running CoreOS, “orchestrate” them using a small Kubernetes cluster running etcd, figure out the “open questions” of networking and storage, and then I continuously deliver multiple redundant copies of each microservice to my fleet. Is that it? -Yes! Isn’t it glorious? I’m going back to Heroku. Want to use Docker and Continuously Deliver that shit? Check out CircleCI’s Docker Support. Want to move fast and not break things?

The watchdog last week imposed a $6.85 million fine on Google after ruling last year that the firm was abusing its dominance by requiring the pre-installation of certain applications on mobile devices using Android. The fine followed a complaint by Russia’s Yandex computer mega-company. Google had appealed the ruling while FAS said an out-of court deal was possible should Google admit to violations of antitrust laws and pay a fine. “The talks with Google on the issue of the settlement agreement have come to nothing. Now it’s up to the court to draw a line under this case,” Interfax quoted Elena Zaeva, head of FAS’s Department for Regulation of Telecommunications and Information Technology, as saying. Zaeva was quoted as saying a court would hear Google’s appeal later today.

Home About AC Authors News Categories International National South Dakota Rapid City Election Resources Scorecards Recommended Organizations Topics LibSpeak Subscribe - RSS On Our Knees for America While Domestic Government Agencies Increase Their Arms by David Whitney / on August 16, 2016 at 9:05 pm / America is in trouble. I came across three items this week which illustrate that fact. “WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared to suggest Tuesday that recently murdered Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot near his townhouse in Washington, D.C. last month, was the source of the WikiLeaks-exposed DNC emails. Assange hinted at the newest revelations during an interview on the Dutch television program Nieuwsuur. “Our whistleblowers go to significant efforts to give us material, at often very significant risks,” Assange said. “There was a 27 year old, works for the DNC, who was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons other than that he was walking down the street in Washington.”[1] Some posit that Seth Rich should be added to the growing Clinton body count. If so, what high mountain of hubris did the pantsuit candidate stand on at her convention to call for more gun control in light of Seth Rich’s assassination? And by the way, with all the politicians drooling on themselves to take guns from the hands of citizens, what they are not telling us is the very sinister side of this. ADVERTISEMENT Our Founders warned us of the severe danger of having a standing army. Since World War II we have ignored that warning. But now a new threat is that we now have a force the size of an army on our soil that is not officially military but has as great a fire power as the entire force of U.S. Marines. “Open the Books, a taxpayer watchdog group, released a study Wednesday [June 22, 2016] that finds domestic government agencies continue to grow their stockpiles of military-style weapons, as Democrats sat on the House floor calling for more restrictions on what guns American citizens can buy. ADVERTISEMENT “The ‘Militarization of America’ report found civilian agencies spent $1.48 billion on guns, ammunition, and military-style equipment between 2006 and 2014. Examples include IRS agents with AR-15s, and EPA bureaucrats wearing camouflage. “‘Regulatory enforcement within administrative agencies now carries the might of military-style equipment and weapons,’ Open the Books said. ‘For example, the Food and Drug Administration includes 183 armed “special agents,” a 50 percent increase over the ten years from 1998-2008. At Health and Human Services (HHS), “Special Office of Inspector General Agents” are now trained with sophisticated weaponry by the same contractors who train our military special forces troops.’ “Open the Books found there are now over 200,000 non-military federal officers with arrest and firearm authority, surpassing the 182,100 personnel who are actively serving in the U.S. Marine Corps. “The IRS spent nearly $11 million on guns, ammunition, and military-style equipment for its 2,316 special agents. The tax collecting agency has billed taxpayers for pump-action and semi-automatic shotguns, semi-automatic Smith & Wesson M&P15s, and Heckler & Koch H&K 416 rifles, which can be loaded with 30-round magazines. “The EPA spent $3.1 million on guns, ammo, and equipment, including drones, night vision, ‘camouflage and other deceptive equipment,’ and body armor.” Harrington continues, “Open the Books appealed to both liberals like Bernie Sanders–who has called for demilitarizing local police departments–and conservatives in its report. “‘Conservatives argue that it is hypocritical for political leaders to undermine the Second Amendment while simultaneously equipping non-military agencies with hollow-point bullets and military style equipment,’ Open the Books said. ‘One could argue the federal government itself has become a gun show that never adjourns with dozens of agencies continually shopping for new firearms.’” And add to that “how many millions of rounds of ammunition their local and State police agencies are amassing. And don’t let anybody tell you all of this ammunition is for “practice.” We are talking about hollow-point pistol rounds and military rifle rounds such as 5.56 and .308 calibers. [Chuck Baldwin states,] I would take an educated guess (based on my conversations with both ammunition and arms suppliers and police officers themselves) that your local police agencies have enough ammunition stockpiled to kill the entire population of your community four or five times. But these numbers pale in comparison to the numbers of guns and ammunition being amassed by federal agencies–including agencies that nowhere come close to being categorized as “police” agencies….So, while federal agencies in Washington, D.C., are being increasingly militarized, the American people are being told they need to surrender their means of self-defense.”[2] The third item relates to the warning President Eisenhower issued in his 1961 speech, “ “This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence — economic, political, even spiritual — is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government… we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the militaryindustrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.”[3] That was in 1961. He warned us that the interests of businesses who make money from perpetual war in collusion with politicians and high level members of the military whose interests are served to push for perpetual war will lead to the destruction of our land. Well consider the 2016 update given at the first weekend of August, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange added to that warning with this, “Google has been to the White House, on average over the last four years, once per week—more than any other single company. It spends more money lobbying Washington, D.C., than any other single company. Hillary Clinton’s former staffer, Jared Cohen, was hired by Google in 2009 to head up Google’s internal think tank. There’s a lot of other interconnections between Google and the state. Eric Schmidt is now also, at the same time as being chairman of what is now Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is chairman of the Pentagon innovation board. So you have a connection between Google, the Clinton campaign, which will be almost certainly the next White House, and the Pentagon. And this triangle is extremely worrying, because, as time goes by, Google is understanding that it does have an ability to influence election campaigns. It’s also bought more than 10 drone companies. It’s integrating its mapping data in order to better be able to fly and navigate drones around the world, is expanding into every country in the world. And it has a very strange, quasi-religious vision of the future, of this vision of the singularity. It’s really a—I’ve done research that it’s very disturbing what they believe in Silicon Valley, that they believe they can create a massive artificial intelligence, more powerful than any human being or any society’s ability to think. And, of course, we all know what happens when such power is in limited hands. And so, Google in the White House will be, essentially, an unregulatable company… you can just completely forget about any kind of antitrust legislation being used on Google if there is a Hillary Clinton White House.” Then his interviewer asked, “I’m reminded that Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator, said that fascism more appropriately should be called corporatism, because it merges the private power of corporations with the military might of the nation-state. And, of course, he thought that was a good thing. It occurs to me that you were describing our newer, kinder, gentler, smiling face of fascism, where all of the information that we receive is controlled by that same collusion between government and major transnational corporations, and now our ability to even talk to myself, or ourselves.” To which Julian replied, “Yes, there is a merger going on at a rapid pace between the largest American corporations and the traditional aspects of the U.S. state, the military intelligence aspects.”[4] America is in trouble. What should we as disciples of Jesus Christ do? Turn to 1 Peter 2:5, because the first thing we must understand is who we are in this world and then what it is that Jesus Christ calls upon us to do.

Its test-drive course with global carmakers such as Toyota and Ford has exceeded 3 million kilometers.  Hyundai has also poured resources into futuristic automotive technologies such as self-driving cars and full-electric vehicles, but the carmaker may have found it easier to team up with tech firms to speed up related development efforts. “It is not the first time that the two firms have sought a partnership,” said an industry source close to the matter on condition of anonymity. “A few years ago they had attempted to jointly develop self-driving technology, but the talks failed due to their different corporate culture.” By Lee Ji-yoon (jylee@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Rahul R   August 17, 2016 13:53 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares Will India lead other countries in hosting next-gen exclusively-branded Google Nexus smartphonesReuters In a speculated development, India could be on top of Google's radar as far as launching next-gen exclusively-branded smartphones is concerned. At this point in time, new Google devices that are expected to be launched soon are the Nexus smartphones that are apparently codenamed Sailfish and Marlin respectively. As per an NDTV Gadgets report, Google is currently engrossed in working on exclusively-branded smartphones due for release some time in September this year. Why advertise with us?

Also, unnamed sources (of NDTV Gadgets) have stated that these devices would offer both 32 and 128 GB internal storage variants. It is also likely that Google's Android 7.0 (Nougat) would be the driving platform behind the new Nexus smartphones expected to be launched in India relatively early compared to previous launch schedules. Google's new handsets carrying exclusive Google branding are also rumoured to be manufactured by Taiwan-based HTC. Rumored key technical specs of Nexus Sailfish The alleged Nexus Sailfish smartphone is said to feature the following key technical specs: 5-inch display with resolutions of 1920 x 1080 with pixel density of 440 ppi Android 7.0 (Nougat) operating platform 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC 4 GB RAM 13 MP rear camera LTE, HSPA, Bluetooth 4.0 and microUSB connectivity 2,770 mAh battery Rumored key technical specs of Nexus Marlin 5.5-inch AMOLED display with resolutions of 2550 x 1440 with pixel density of 534 ppi Android 7.0 (Nougat) operating system 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC 4 GB RAM 12 MP rear camera and 8 MP front camera LTE, HSPA, Bluetooth 4.0 and microUSB connectivity 3,450 mAh battery Also read Can Xiaomi Mi Max beat OnePlus 2 and Google Nexus 5X?

(AP) – Google is warning that an impasse over access to utility poles could lead the company to pull the plug on its plans to bring its fiber optic broadband service to Nashville. Google Fiber says it needs Metro Council to enact a “one touch” policy to allow its contractors to move other telecoms’ lines in order install its own. Comcast and AT&T say current rules requiring their own employees to move the lines prevent outages and limit liability and safety concerns. Mayor Megan Barry is urging the Nashville Electric Service to help seek a resolution among Google Fiber, AT&T and Comcast regarding the city’s utility pole policy. “High-speed broadband service is critical to the city of Nashville’s future,” said Barry, who has not come out on either side of the dispute. “A resolution to this issue that is fair to all will only benefit our citizens.” Chris Levendos, head of Google Fiber’s network deployment, said the impasse is delaying the rollout of fiber – and possibly endangering it altogether. “Worst-case scenario is either elongation or it just ceases to happen,” Levendos said. Google Fiber announced its plans to expand into Nashville in January 2015, but efforts to connect the service have been slower than expected because the city’s hard limestone soil has made the company rely on utility poles instead of underground cables for 90 percent of the 3,200 miles of fiber it plans to install. Google wants Nashville to pass a similar ordinance to one enacted in Louisville, Kentucky, to overcome what the company describes as an overly burdensome process to attach cables. “People in Nashville are looking for choice and competition and want the opportunity to have the best available services,” Levendos said. “They want to have companies competing for them, and this ordinance created the opportunity to propel that further for any investor that would want to build a small or large network here in Nashville.” But Joelle Phillips, the president of AT&T Tennessee, told Metro Council on Monday evening that the company disagrees with the “assumption that a party that’s new can diagnose the problem and the solution.” AT&T is a heavy political contributor in the state and has strong connections to union-friendly council members because its employees are organized by the Communication Workers of America. The company owns 20 percent of the city’s utility poles, with the remainder owned by Nashville Electric Service. “We appreciate your interest in letting us talk to each other to work it out, and we hope that you recognize that this is not a process that is needlessly complex,” Phillips said. “It’s a process where people can get hurt when things aren’t done correctly. Service gets interrupted when things aren’t done correctly.” Andy Macke, vice president of government and community affairs for Comcast, said his company has seen a 50 percent failure rate in another market where Google Fiber has had one touch authorization. “The reality is nobody’s going to care for your stuff like you do,” Macke said.

By Keith Naughton and Dana Hull. Added by Agency Staff on 17 August 2016. Saved under Top, World Tags: BMW, Cruise Automation, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Google, Lyft, Mark Fields, Nirenberg Neuroscience, Sheila Nirenberg, Uber, Velodyne Lidar Tweet Ford Motor Co, which put the world on wheels a century ago, is now taking the driver out of the driver’s seat. The company said it plans to have a fully autonomous vehicle — no steering wheel and no accelerator or brake pedals — available by 2021 for ride-hailing services. “We see the autonomous car changing the way the world moves once again,” CEO Mark Fields said at Ford’s research lab in Palo Alto, California. “They address a whole host of safety, social and environmental issues.” Like Google, Ford will skip the interim steps of driver-assisted technology as a way to evolve toward full autonomy. Its plan to deploy self-driving cars in ride-hailing and ride-sharing fleets is similar to what General Motors aims to do with Lyft. Ford’s 2021 scheduled start matches BMW’s ambitious timeframe. “We believe in our plan that taking the driver out of the loop is really important,” Fields said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. The automaker couldn’t find a sensible way through the “no man’s land” — determining exactly when a robotic car should to try to re-engage a human driver in an emergency. The second biggest US car maker didn’t say how many autonomous cars it plans to produce by 2021. Earlier on Tuesday, Ford said it’s doubling the number of people at the Silicon Valley lab to 260 while expanding to two more buildings. It also invested $75m in the leading maker of an advanced radar system to accelerate its development of self-driving cars. There’s some catching up to do: Google’s self-driving car project has already amassed almost 3m kilometres of public road testing. Ford said it’s investing in or collaborating with four start-ups on autonomous vehicles, bringing its roster of such partnerships to 40. Ford’s plan lacks specifics of how it will make this great leap to full automation, said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for researcher Autotrader. “I’m not seeing all the pieces of the puzzle in place because they don’t have a relationship with a ride-hailing service like Uber or Lyft,” Krebs said. “It’s a first step and at least Wall Street will see that they’re working on this.” Ford CEO Mark Fields Lidar investment Ford and China’s top search engine company, Baidu, are each investing $75m in Velodyne Lidar, the  car maker said in a statement. Lidar bounces light off objects to assess shape and location, giving self-driving cars a 360-degree view of their environment with the help of cameras and traditional radar. Morgan Hill, California-based Velodyne said the money will help it improve design and expand production, making the sensors more affordable for mass adoption. Ford wants “to do as much as they can internally, but also acknowledge that it’s best to partner with those who have the leading technology”, Jeff Schuster, an analyst at research firm LMC Automotive. Ford also said it acquired SAIPS, an Israel-based computer vision and machine learning company, to boost its capabilities in artificial intelligence. In addition, the company struck an exclusive licensing agreement with New York-based Nirenberg Neuroscience, founded by neuroscientist Sheila Nirenberg. Ford said she has developed a machine vision platform that it hopes can bring “human-like intelligence” to autonomous cars. Ford didn’t disclose financial details of either deal. Ford reiterated last month’s announcement that it was among five investors providing $6,6m in seed funding for Civil Maps, a California start-up that creates three-dimensional maps for driverless cars. GM acquisitions General Motors has spent almost $600m — and will spend more — acquiring self-driving software maker Cruise Automation and invested $500m for a 9% stake in Lyft. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has teamed up with Google to develop 100 self-driving minivans. Ford conducted unsuccessful negotiations with Google prior to the Chrysler deal. Since GM announced its acquisition of Cruise Automation in March, the staff at the company has grown to 100 from 40, said Kevin Kelly, a GM spokesman. GM is testing Cruise’s self-driving software on Chevy Bolt electric cars in Scottsdale, Arizona. GM also has a research lab in Palo Alto that employs about 12 people, Kelly said. “Our goal is to use our autonomous technology in an on-demand ride-sharing network,” Kelly said. “Cruise paired perfectly with Lyft.” Velodyne said it “expects an exponential increase in lidar sensor deployments” and that it will continue to work with top automotive and ride-sharing companies worldwide. “We want the cost to be low enough to be used for all cars,” Marta Hall, Velodyne’s president of business development, said in the statement.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Sonic2k Would be lovely, I would truly appreciate this.

 Running Because this system uses Google Accounts with OAuth2 for authentication there are a few steps one needs to complete in order to get a working system: Create a super user: (ve)$ ve/bin/django-admin createsuperuser
 Start the application on local address 127.0.0.1:8000: (ve)$ ve/bin/django-admin runserver
 OAuth works with HTTP based callbacks & token exchange, for this to work our local server needs to be reachable on the Internet. Ngrok is a great utility that allows for this. Follow the installation instructions on the Ngrok website for your operating system. Once installed run: $ ngrok 8000
 This will generate a random ngrok.com subdomain for you on which your local server will be reachable. The random subdomain address is useful for adhoc testing but we would recommend you use something predictable. This can be done using the -subdomain command line argument: $ ngrok -subdomain mc2 8000
 If you haven’t already, create a Google Developer Project at https://console.developers.google.com/project . Next, navigate to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials , select the ‘OAuth Consent Screen’, choose a product name and save. Then select “New credentials” and select “OAuth Client ID”. Then enter the necessary information Once saved, Google will have generated the unique keys you will need to complete the OAuth setup: For quick setup, you would then enter the following: (ve)$ export SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY="647082549192-142tni49187fck8i2n1p0ptjofihd1k4.apps.googleusercontent.com"
(ve)$ export SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET="mJG2Qgbsmwal8MdCeP_7x_S6D"
 Your Google OAuth setup should now be configured. You can specify the following environment variables to configure the app: # Django settings

Since last winter, the Munich-based company has been powering Google hotel scores for search and maps where TrustYou finds a match between its hotel database and Google’s hotel database — that’s about 300,000 hotels. (When there isn’t a match, Google shows its Google Score.)* Update: Aug. 18: This article has been updated with corrections to some of the nuances of the TrustYou Stars platform and the Google partnership. A few quotes and the headline (“…and it isn’t afraid of TripAdvisor”) have been clarified to prevent a possibly misleading impression that TrustYou is competing with TripAdvisor when, in fact, it is a pure B2B play that styles itself “the Switzerland of reviews” and is a great partner with TripAdvisor when it comes to its reputation management software. TrustYou says that, for hotels that have begun to use its TrustYou Stars platform, which rolled out this year, on average, 75% of new hotel reviews on Google now come via the platform. The Stars tool expands the volume and reach of the hotel review data which can be seen on Google, Kayak, Skyscanner, and Wego. The company’s software also identifies review content from Expedia Inc and Priceline Group brands and analyzes that data, too. It mainly only excludes reviews from TripAdvisor, the user-reviews giant. Looking ahead, TrustYou thinks it can thrive, despite competition from rival reputation management companies, such as Revinate and ReviewPro, and guest survey companies like Medallia. Earlier this summer, TrustYou acquired Checkmate, a real-time messaging specialist for hotels to communicate with guests, for an undisclosed sum. We recently checked in with Benjamin Jost, chief executive and co-founder of TrustYou, to find out how his company plans to ride an expected wave of hotel investment in online reputation management. Jost outlined his belief that Google and other players will increasingly challenge TripAdvisor’s dominance in reviews. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Tnooz: Nothing personal, but hotel general managers, when they proverbially wake up at three o’clock in the morning, they’re worried about their TripAdvisor score, not their TrustYou score. Is TrustYou just never going to be able to compete with the giant that is TripAdvisor? Jost: TripAdvisor has built a great brand. No one competes with that overnight. With more and more eyeballs on our data, especially with the launch on Google, we do see more and more hotels caring about the TrustScore, too. I would say we just started with the past year, when the Google deal actually launched. Separately, we are great partners with TripAdvisor when it comes to our reputation management software, where we license their review data. We do show TripAdvisor ratings and reviews to hotels, because hotels NEED to see that and respond to that. Tnooz: Every hotel seems to have a sticker saying it is rated on TripAdvisor. TrustYou for years had has a quality symbol, but not as many hotels tell guests about that. Is TrustYou going to be stuck in second place next to TripAdvisor? Jost: No. As an analogy, take J.D. Power, which does customer satisfaction surveys in the States. It’s an example of where you have a third-party, non-competing brand, very popular amongst users because it’s trustworthy, and it becomes more and more popular. It’s not competing with anyone. We have a good chance of being a kind of J.D. Power for the travel industry. We’ve seen other industries have a player like that rise up. Why not in travel? TripAdvisor is, to a certain extent, at cross-purposes with the hotels in how it markets its metasearch tool and mobile app as a consumer entry point. I’m not judging. But because TrustYou is not competing for consumer attention, we’re a very, very easy choice for hotels… We can show that if you improve your score, you increase conversion on these metasearch sites. There’s a payoff to the investment. Plus, we offer a product tuned to hotel needs. To get technical, we give them control. A hotel can take our data and say, “I want to display my entire ranking relative to all hotels in my city. Or just based on the best-ranked family hotels. Or, I want to rank it on the best boutique hotels. Or I want a ranking on the hotels with the best bar.” We’re not competing with anyone… That’s a different positioning. Tnooz: How will the reputation management landscape look three or five years from now? Jost: Ideally, every hotel will use our services when it comes to guest feedback, for collecting and analyzing it. That means putting guest feedback on their own brand.com site and app, for instance, with our tools. Tnooz: The mix of unverified and verified reviews on TripAdvisor still seems to have the most power and momentum and scale. Jost: All this talk about verified, unverified…. It’s the user who will decide what kind of data point they trust or not. Apparently, they trust the TripAdvisor data point very much even though we, as the industry, say that some of those reviews are unverified. The user, for most of the part, doesn’t care. It’s less about the verified/unverified debate, and it’s more about who drives the booking…. Tnooz: You agree that hotels care more about TripAdvisor than Google these days, when it comes to reviews? Jost: That’s fair, yes. But that will change. My assumption is that Google is going to become a very dominant player that is going to provide a huge amount of leads throughout the funnel, be it directly to brand.com or through the intermediaries. It is going to be a central starting point in the travel journey, more and more. Google is in a great position because it never steals any SEO power from the hotels. The hotel can plug in the review content it has collected via the Stars platform, and that would never count as duplicate content, even though you would find the same review as a Google Review on Google. It’s an advantage because all the other players out there, they need this SEO power. They need the unique content piece. Everyone is competing against each other, and the only one who is really not competing in that game is Google, because they’re the entrance point of search and inspiration. We also don’t compete with anyone because we don’t need to. We are a pure B2B play. We are the Switzerland of review analysis and reputation management. Tnooz: You seem to be saying there’s going to be a tipping point where hotels will realize your TrustScore has a huge impact. Jost: Yes, but more broadly… Despite your questions, I’m not so worried about when we’ll surpass TripAdvisor. Your framing is wrong: It’s not a zero-sum game. For one reason, using our platform to improve your scores on non-TripAdvisor ratings will usually also help your TripAdvisor ones, too. It’s simple logic. If a service improvement helps raise your TrustYou scores, it will logically also help your TripAdvisor rating, too. We’re going to have a huge impact on the TripAdvisor score indirectly because we can still tell you, “Hey, fix your cold coffee problem that you have in your breakfast room because people are complaining about it.” Once you fix it, you are going to see an increase in your scores across the board. One other thing: We do let a hotel analyze the TripAdvisor channel through our analytics. We just don’t take that channel’s reviews into account when we calculate our review summaries. Hotel marketers will recognize us as a force that drives booking on scale. If they don’t recognize us today, they will. If you count all of them together, Kayak, Google, Skyscanner — how many eyeballs do we have on our data? We may have more eyeballs on our data soon than are on TripAdvisor’s. Our winning model is our focus on B2B, on helping the hotel figure out the most effective ways to improve their product. Tnooz: Thanks. Different topic, please. Why acquire Checkmate? Jost: We wanted to be everywhere on the traveler journey when it comes to guest feedback…. Collecting information from the guest via mobile devices as the guest is about to arrive and during their stay was the last piece of the journey we didn’t haven’t well covered. Tnooz: If Checkmate was so great, why did it have to be a distressed asset sale? Meaning, why is this a good acquisition for you? Jost: I can answer generally. Take Expedia. It was an investor in Checkmate, and in Alice, another messaging service. That shows that this segment is still very hot and is at the very beginning. Tnooz: Why will one solution win and another won’t? Jost: It’s going to boil down to execution. How do you build a sales force and execute on marketing effectively. We have at least a good head start in that because we’ve done that sales and marketing work already for other services and we can now plug in this product to all of our customers. We’ve received a lot of positive reaction when we told our customers we’re adding this messaging tech…. You see all these technology stack players. They build a management tool and they want to add a CRM on top and they build some other BI on top and they want to sell this entire technology stack to hotels. We only want to focus on guest feedback….It’s a clearer sales pitch. Tnooz: Isn’t it hard to scale up with independent hotels, with lots of small, one-off deals? Jost: Yes, it’s probably much harder to sell to an independent hotel because the sales cost is higher compared to, “Hey, I just signed Accor,” and 4,000 sales come on board immediately. We don’t have a particularly pure independent sales strategy. We don’t have a particularly pure enterprise sales strategy. We see both as important. With independent hotels, you have to be very effective in your sales approach there, and you have to measure really well how it works. That’s what we’ve been doing. Our team knows today how it works. We know the metrics. We know the funnel. Now we can start to scale that business in the independent hotel sector. Tnooz: How big is your client list? Jost: These numbers everyone is throwing around … Everyone’s saying, “Ah, we’re 50,000 properties. We’re 30,000 properties.” Whatever. I would always say, it depends how you look at it. We are less reliant on a few large chain deals than some competitors. When we say 50,000 hotels worldwide use us for one of our services, we mean we have some of these hotels looking at our data through different portals. We have a lot of hotels looking at our dashboards within a third-party tool or an extranet. For example, we help power the reputation tools on HRS and HolidayCheck. By the end of this year, we have a goal of having specifically 20,000 hotels that feed their own reviews into TrustYou’s guest feedback platform. We will also announce a couple of partnerships with bigger providers that build websites for hotels and that need content to help power brand.com websites or PMS players or CRM players that sit on the guest profile data. We may give them our Stars platform, our feedback platform, for all their hotels for free, so they can start collecting feedback and push it into the guest feedback platform with TrustYou. That’s good for scale. Tnooz: Could you tell us more about TrustYou Stars, your big product push of the year? Jost: Some context, first: We look at all reviews as guest feedback. Whether it is on an OTA or a review site or it is posts and comments on social, it’s guest feedback. We call it surveys when we look at operational procedures of the hotel. But it’s all guest feedback. Why do you want to look at this data feedback in different silos, as some competitor tools do? Why do you want a platform to look at social feedback, but not surveys. Why don’t you want to look at this all together because it’s all together guest feedback? We still let you slice and dice the information to compare and see trends. But we stand out for bringing all the feedback together in the single TrustYou Stars platform. We compete with Medallia, and we’re leaving it behind as the dinosaur in the industry when it comes to guest feedback operations. In 2015, we replaced Medallia for the entire Accor group for all their almost 4,000 hotels. We’ll continue to win big chains because, among other reasons, the TrustYou Stars platform has a sophisticated post-stay survey component. We say, “Hey, if you, at the end of your survey, as a traveler, you get to choose, do you want to push this review or this survey into Google as well and share it with all the other fellow travelers out there? Yes or No?” The traveler has the choice to say, “Yes, I want to share it.” If they say yes, we push it out on Google as a Google Review. This process is unleashing a huge force on behalf of hotels. About half of hotel guest feedback is hidden right now in some guest survey databases not accessible to the web. We say to them, Why don’t you make it public and we take it into account when we calculate your score? Suddenly they can do this, and they make the guest feedback public. It makes for a fuller picture of the stay experience. Now, especially after we fully integrate Checkmate, we’re everywhere guest feedback happens. In the search process, on the intermediary or on the brand.com site, on an app during a stay, and on the post-stay survey or on one of the review channels or be it on their own survey channel or an OTA’s. Our data is responsible for guiding booking decisions. Hotels are noticing.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill is Editor-in-Chief of Tnooz.

Just yesterday, the service was rolled out to users worldwide, which will give many an excuse to skip on Hangouts, a service that Google has barely updated in the past years. So how does it compare with the existing players? Let’s find out! Google Duo What we like: With Duo, Google brings in a fresh new look, but more importantly, it is the simplicity of setting up such a service that got us up and running in no time. No, we are not talking about an Android smartphone, but the same is equally quick to setup even on an iOS device. Compare this to other popular video calling services where you have to create a user ID, and sync your contacts, etc. You get the picture. It makes everything else out there feel old and complex. What we did not like: It has no extra feature, apart from Knock Knock that lets you see the caller before answering the call, and the ability to block numbers. There are some niggles, however. While you can call up your friend who owns an iOS device, Duo for now is only available on your smartphone with a SIM card inside (not even tablets). Also one can only be signed in using one device at any given time. This alone pushes us to the likes of Facebook Messenger. Skype What we like: While Skype was pretty much a simple app earlier, the service soon added chats to its list of features. Placing a call is as simple as tapping the video call button. Being one of the older VoIP calling services also means that there is a lot in here that you could not get elsewhere. This would include Skype to Skype calls, group video calls, instant messaging, screen sharing and more importantly, the ability to call local landline numbers as well. This is indeed plenty more than what Messenger and Duo currently offer. Also, Skype is available on almost every single platform out there (including Windows 10 Mobile) including a web app (it’s even available on the Xbox One). So you have no excuse to not be connected. Skype is also among the few apps that let you host a conference call on video. What we did not like: Setting up Skype did take up a fair bit of time. Hit the sign up button and you have to add your full name, Skype name, Skype password, email ID, and then enter your phone number with the country code. Setup blues aside, the service is not entirely free. You can either choose to fill up your account with Skype credits in advance or pay as you go but this again is only for calling up landline numbers. FaceTime: What we like: It simple to use and comes pre-installed on every Apple device. Like voice calls, Facetime calls can also be answered on any of your Apple devices. Transitioning from data to Wi-Fi connectivity is instant and results in no dropped calls. What we did not like: The service is limited to Apple devices only. Functionality is a bit too limited with just the ability place one on one video calls. All-in-all this is very familiar to what we have on Duo, but Duo is cross-platform and even simpler to use. Facebook Messenger: What we like: It’s simple to use and comes integrated into the Facebook Messenger app. With the primary purpose of the app being instant messaging, you can also place VoIP calls and now, even video calls. Placing a call is as simple as tapping the button on the top right corner of your chat window. Also Facebook recently removed the requirement of having a Facebook account as well, so you can sign up for Messenger and its services with just your phone number. What we did not like: We really have no complaints here as the service is available for free and offers features similar to Skype at no extra cost.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.36am EDT 11:36 Markets are taking a bit of a dip ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, despite oil prices holding up after the US data. But investors also have the UK jobs data and the uncertainty of the Brexit negotiations on their minds. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: There is a certain degree of trepidation in the markets today, with indices selling off sharply in anticipation of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s last meeting, due out this evening. The July FOMC meeting took place after market fears had subsided in the wake of the UK’s referendum on EU membership, with the statement citing diminished near-term risks. If the committee no longer believes external factors are worth worrying about, then a 2016 rate hike is a distinct possibility. Given that much of the post-referendum surge in stocks has come from dovish monetary policy implications, hawkish comments are likely to exacerbate the weakness we are already seeing for markets today. Today’s UK jobs report is significant in the post-referendum world, with Brexiteer jeers ringing out as they use the figures to back their argument that the pro-remain camp was fear-mongering with its warnings over the impact on the economy. It is certainly too early to say how the UK economy will react to the referendum result and eventual Brexit from the EU, but today’s surprise decrease in July claimants suggests that businesses are waiting it out rather than making any rash judgements of the implications. Comments from Germany’s European Affairs Minister hinting that the UK may be able to obtain a “special status” post-Brexit are an encouraging signal ahead of the exit negotiations. Once article 50 is enacted, any perceived developments within trade discussions are sure to be significant volatility drivers in the markets, raising the prospect of two years of unpredictability. The number one concern within the city is whether the UK will retain passporting rights, and success on this issue could define whether negotiations are perceived as a success or failure within financial markets.

The thinktank warns that a near “lost decade” in household incomes is in danger of being extended by a triple whammy of slower economic growth, higher inflation, and benefit cuts. Resolution’s analysis of ONS figures found that working age households have been the ones to suffer. Adam Corlett, economic analyst at Resolution Foundation: Despite welcome income growth in 2015-16, the typical non-retired household remains some £400 a year worse-off than before the financial crisis of 2008. We’re closing in on a lost decade for working-age households, which leaves the typical family around £8,500 a year poorer than would have been the case had we maintained pre-crisis levels of income growth. The concern now is that lower income working-age households risk experiencing a ‘triple whammy’ of income recovery shocks as growth slows in the aftermath of the EU referendum vote, inflation picks up and cuts such as the four-year freeze on working-age benefits start to bite. This risks not only delaying the recovery for these families, but flipping it into reverse.

Both said a September interest rate rise was possible, sending spot gold down 0.2% at $1,343 an ounce, while US gold was down 0.6% at $1,348.60 an ounce. Rate rises tend to mean a stronger dollar, and a stronger dollar tends to signal weaker gold prices.

I like to think of building an e-commerce site for SEO as the equivalent of In-N-Out Burger’s “secret” menu: You can customize like crazy, just as long as you know how to ask (Animal style anyone?). Let me explain.  Buried in the recesses of many e-commerce websites are options to increase sales and conversions simply by optimizing them with the best possible SEO tactics that suit your needs. REI, for example, offers hundreds of products—each with its product description, metadata, customer reviews, Q&A, and sometimes a custom product video. And there’s way more where that comes from: Zappos and The Body Shop are both giving us custom product videos. Over at Staples and ASOS, you can see the clean UX and site architecture. And, Seattle-based e-commerce icon, Amazon, gives us customer reviews filtered by stars, formats, and reviewers. Of course, DIY-ing SEO for your e-commerce is an option both promising and intimidating: Implementing SEO strategies all on your own feels like a major win, but with so many tactics to choose from, simply getting started can feel overwhelming. So, I’m here to provide guidance. Ahead, I’m offering a roadmap for how to get started with SEO for your e-commerce website. Follow these tips when building your e-commerce site, and you’ll wind up with a website that will drive your traffic—plus, your website won’t look like an episode of Hoarders invaded it. Why is SEO Important for E-Commerce? Gaining new customers can be hard, especially if you’re not being found by search engines. And, with 44% of online shoppers beginning their search with a search engine,  you’re going to want to hop on the SEO bandwagon. Why? Well, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, e-commerce sales in 2015 were $341.7 billion for the year. That’s a 14.6% increase compared to 2014s $298.3 billion. The report went on further to note that online sales were 7.3% of total retail sales in 2015, versus 6.4% in 2014. Still not convinced to use SEO for e-commerce? Kissmetrics saw that 30.5% of all traffic to Yotpo’s database was coming from organic searches on Google, Bing, Yahoo, and other search engines. Or, check out Ahrefs case study on Australia-based toy company, ToyUniverse. Ahrefs saw an increase in organic traffic by 116% through SEO efforts. And, let’s not forget about SEMrush’s double jeopardy technique to increase site traffic by 1780%. And, check out this study from Points Group on the value of ranking #1 in Google—for every $1.00 spent, they earned $4.76 back. If you’ve been paying attention during the past decade (or even the last few sentences), you’ll have noticed a movement of e-commerce businesses truly owning their SEO strategies. Be it technical SEO, fixing meta, or opting for off-site support, online businesses far and wide are shifting away from traditional marketing trends and choosing, instead, to target consumers online with whatever excites them. Plus, any opportunity to enhance your click-through rate in the SERPs should always be taken. Why? This study by Infront Webworks goes in-depth about the average click-through rate based on your positions on page one of Google. Now when planning a marketing calendar, key terms like “340k per billboard” and “blink-ad” have been replaced with “https” and “noindex, follow”. I’m seeing a welcome shift toward digital marketing, especially SEO, to give e-commerce brands something that makes me them stand out from the cookie-cutter crowd—whether it’s fixing broken links, updating meta tags, replacing duplicate content, or compressing product images. It’s all SEO. So, in honor of the non-traditional, anti-duplicate content, real-SEO era in which we’re living, I’ve decided to highlight five SEO strategies that are essential to shifting your e-commerce site away from the one-marketing-tactic-fits-all mantra. Read on for what I have to say about my client case studies, and let these words (and beauteous websites) serve as the inspiration to let your SEO optimized e-commerce flag fly. 1. Keyword Research Every 60 seconds, 700,000 Google searches are performed. That’s a lot. And, want to hear something even crazier? The average consumer processes 100,500 digital words on a daily basis. So, with all this information, how do you make sure customers find you in the search engines? To reach your consumers, you must start with a targeted keyword list. As you may expect, creating keyword lists are a must-have when getting any new client or preparing your site. I admit I’m overjoyed that keyword stuffing is a thing of the past, and I fully support long-tail keyword terms and writing high-quality content surrounding those long-tail terms. Noted by Glenn Gabe in his analysis of 3,000 keywords, 7% of the total keywords were head terms, and 93% were long tail keywords. Now, you’re probably asking yourself: What is the difference between head terms and long tail keywords? Head terms (or short-tail) are keywords that searchers mostly use on search engines. These are typically shorter, mostly 0-26 characters. For example, “bed sheets”, could be a head term. Head terms can drive a large amount of traffic, but not necessarily traffic that converts. Long-tail keywords are longer (26-40 characters) and typically a more specific version of the head term. For example, “bed sheets that keep you cool”. While long-tail keywords drive lower traffic volumes and impressions, I do see a higher pattern of clicks and conversions when compared to head terms. Want more proof? Seer Interactive and Annie Cushing tested this idea on 12 of their clients in six different industries. While the head terms received 11 times more traffic, the average conversion rates for the long-tail keywords were 4.15% higher than the short-tail. Let’s walk through how to find long-tail keyword search terms: Step one: Bucket your keyword terms based on the main seed word. Here’s an example: Step two: I started by choosing one product name (ex: Flannel Sheet Set) and entered the product name into the Google Keyword Planner. Step three: Sort through your list to find keywords with four or more words. Step four: If you’re optimizing a product description, go further into the keyword research process. For example, below I started to build out “king flannel sheet sets”, by searching through the Google Keyword Planner. Step Five: Once you’ve built out your keyword buckets, start categorizing your keywords based on informational keywords that would make for great blog posts and purchase intent keywords that will drive conversions. For example, take a look at FreePeople’s blog post. In this specific post, FreePeople is providing its users with informational content that ties together their product line. To help build these keyword buckets, here are some of my favorite free keyword tools: Google Autosuggest: Simply type in your keyword search term and wait for Google’s autosuggest to populate below. Google Related Search Suggestions: After you type in your keyword search term in the Google search box, scroll down for related searches. Ubersuggest: Type in a head word or a product name into the search bar to get a flood of results. Keywordtool.io: Start pairing product names with informational content. Keyword Dominator: If you’re marketing in the Amazon Seller Network, I’d highly recommend checking this tool out. It’s ah-mazing! Amazon Suggest: Similar to Google Autosuggest but filled with great product keywords to target. Wikipedia: I quickly scan to see if there are any keyword terms or phrases that might be relevant to the site I’m working on. Don’t forget to look at the “Contents” section. These are hidden gem keywords to build from. SEMrush: While you get more with the paid version of SEMrush, it’s pretty awesome to see where your competitors are being ranked. Just add the domain and simply click over to “Organic Research.” 2. Site Architecture Ecommerce brands, listen up: If you’ve been looking for an excuse to revamp your website, this may be it. Site architecture (or how you organize your site) is crucial for all e-commerce sites. Mostly due to the fact most e-commerce websites have millions of product pages. The site architecture allows you to map out how the user flows through your website. As the website owner, you want the user to be able to quickly identify key pages and the relationships between the pages. Take a peek at Wal-Mart’s 23 million pages in Google: Here’s an example of how your site architecture should look: Here’s an example of what your site architecture should not look like: Creating a bad user flow experience with your site architecture can hurt your SEO. Using this bad site architecture example above, you can see that the pages are way too “deep”. The authority of the links is diluted by the time you get to your category and product pages. If you’re interested in mapping out your site architecture on your own, I suggest Balsamiq or Lucid Chart. My rule of thumb: It should take the user at most three clicks to get back to your homepage.  Let’s use Zappos as a real-life example of good site architecture. Head over to Zappos and see how many clicks it takes you to get to a product page. If I’m looking for shoes, I’ll click “Shoes” in the navigation bar. Then, I’ll choose the type of shoes I’m looking for using the left-hand rail Zappos conveniently displays. Finally, I’m greeted with 5,857 items to choose from for my “Women’s Sneakers & Athletic Shoes” category. It took three clicks for Zappos to get me to product pages. This is ideal for the user experience as well as making it easy for Google to index your content. Before building your navigation and site structure, walk-through this mind-mapping process. Step one: Ask yourself these questions: What search queries do consumers use before they get to your site? What search queries do consumers use once they’re on your site? What pages on your website get the most traffic? What are your top exit pages? Step two: Decide if the drop-down menus are something you’d like to incorporate in your navigation bar. If you decide to move forward with the drop down menu (as most sites do) make sure you’re using HTML. This is a common mistake I see when working on e-commerce sites. Search engines cannot find your navigation unless it’s written in HTML. Also, keep in mind you don’t want to go link crazy. Moz recommends 100 links per page max. Step three: Use your head keyword terms (as discussed above) to decide what you want to name your category pages. I would recommend using this head keyword term in your page title, header, and include it in the top 200-word paragraph. Here’s an example from Wrightwood Furniture: While the meta data in this example isn’t ideal, this gives you an idea of how you can repeat your head terms throughout your category pages. Step four: If you’re using filters (as most e-commerce sites with 20 products or more on a page do), pay close attention to your URL parameters. Funky URL parameters can cause duplicate content. Here’s an example from Amazon: As you probably guessed, Amazon is using parameters for their filters. If you choose to go the Amazon route which keeps your filtered products indexed, you’ll need to create filters to display in a custom order. For example, your URL parameter should look clean like this ?size=7&color=blue. If you choose to not index filters, add a hashtag (#) before your parameters. For example, if Amazon created the URL www.amazon.com/shop/amazon-devices#?color=blue&price=$200&sort=newest, it will simply point to everything before the hashtag, so www.amazon.com/shop/amazon-devices. Everything after the hashtag won’t be indexed by Google, but the links pointing to you will count toward Page Authority. Step five: Add breadcrumbs to your product pages to give users and the search engines another opportunity to see where your product fits on your site. Another cool thing about breadcrumbs? Sometimes Google will show your breadcrumbs instead of your URL. This is what popped up when I did a search for Apple TV: If you’re into organized, clean designs—and I’m not just talking a website filled with whitespace or excluding imagery; I mean piecing together your navigation logically, finding pages where you’d expect to find them, and a URL structure that follows your navigation—creating hierarchy site architecture might just become your new best friend. 3. Technical SEO Technical SEO will forever be in my heart (and web redesign queues). And if you’re an e-commerce business, technical SEO will forever be on your marketing calendar. The technical SEO is no longer simply about sitemaps and meta tags. As the lines between technical SEO and on-site SEO continue to blur, it’s easier than ever to build a website with clean URLs, correct internal linking, and most importantly, without any stacked redirects. If you’ve found your website is lacking in the technical SEO department, you’ll be surprised at just how far a few simple updates can go. By inserting canonical tags and switching up homepage internal links for the right content, you’ll realize that technical SEO can improve just about any site, e-commerce or not. Let’s dive into some of the technical SEO ideas that will you bring your site from sad-face to smiley-face emoji in 😍 no time. Step One: Implement Schema Markup Wouldn’t life be great if Google solved our daily “my site isn’t getting found” dilemma? Well, with rich snippets or schema markup, you’re able to highlight specific pieces of information for Google and other search engines. There are two types of schema markup you’re going to want to add to your e-commerce website. Each of these has their attributes. 1. Product schema markup: This requires the product name and price. There are also other cool features you can add such as image, description, URL, and brand name. Here’s an example of product schema markup from the SERP view: Here’s an example of the product schema markup on the backend: <meta itemprop=”name” content=”MacBook Air” /> <div itemprop=”brand” itemscope=”itemscope” itemtype=”http://schema.org/Organization”> <meta itemprop=”name” content=”Apple” /> 2. Review schema markup: This requires two types of markup – 1.) aggregate ratings and 2.) individual review. To implement aggregate, you’ll need: Overall rating value, rating count, best rating, and worst rating. To implement the individual review, you’ll need: Reviewer, review date, review value, best rating, worst rating, and review body. Here’s an example of review schema markup from the SERP view: Here’s an example of aggregate ratings on the backend: <div class=”spaceB15″ itemprop=”reviewRating” itemscope itemtype=”http://schema.org/Rating”> <meta itemprop=”worstRating” content=”0″> <meta itemprop=”bestRating” content=”5″> <meta itemprop=”ratingValue” content=”4″> <span class=”h4″>Editors’ rating:</span><span class=”spaceL10 rating stars-4″></span> </div> Here’s an example of individual review on the backend: <div itemprop=”itemReviewed” itemscope itemtype=”http://schema.org/Product”> <meta itemprop=”name” content=”Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, early 2015)”> </div> <h1 class=”h1″ itemprop=”name”>Apple MacBook Air (13-Inch, Early 2015) Review <span class=”badge”> <img src=”http://www.laptopmag.com/resources/img/editors-choice-med.gif?e0c19ff” width=”56″ height=”44″ alt=”Editor’s Choice”> </span> While this may seem little overwhelming to any beginner, you can use Google’s structured data markup helper or the structured data testing tool. Both of these will ensure you’ve set-up your structured data properly and everything is working as it should. Step Two: Clean Up URLs Visualize the pages of your website. Now think about how much of it your users actually navigate to. For many of us, the discrepancy between pretty, clean URL structures and dynamic URLs is extreme. It’s hardly surprising, considering how quickly we assign a sentimental value to our URL structure — and forget about what’s best for our site. But having a disorganized URL structure can be a major pain to your consumers, especially when you have hoards of product pages and categories. So, here’s a few tips I like to follow when creating my URL structure. Swap dynamic URLs for clean URLs Ditch the parameters (e.g. ?productId=50763526&cp) Never use spaces or underscores, opt for dashes Stick with all lower-case letters Add targeted keywords Keep it short and sweet If you need further guidance, check out what Google has to say about simple URL structures here. Step Three: Switch to HTTPS if You’re Still an HTTP With so much private information like credit card numbers, passwords, and home addresses at their disposal, e-commerce website owners have become the forefront for HTTPS. It’s so important for e-commerce that Shopify allowed users to activate their SSL certifications at no additional charge. So, what’s the difference between HTTP and HTTPS? HTTPS (Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol) is essentially HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). It’s just a more secure version. Like HTTP, HTTPS allows the browser to begin a connection to the server on a standard port. However, HTTPS then adds a layer of security using SSL (Secure Socket Layers) to transfer data. This helps to avoid damages by third parties and keeps data encrypted. On top of the bonus security features that HTTPS offers, HTTPS is also a ranking factor. Google announced in 2014 that sites offering a secure site through HTTPS would experience higher ranking benefits. If you’re switching over from HTTP to HTTPS, follow Google’s recommended steps: Determine which certification you need: single, multi-domain, or wildcard certificate Use the 2048-bit certificates Stick to relative URLs for resources that exist on the same secure domain Opt for protocol relative URLs for all other domains Make sure your HTTPS site isn’t blocked from crawling in the robots.txt Avoid the no index robots meta tag. Monitor your HTTP to HTTPS migration closely in Google Webmaster Tools. Raise your hand if you have heard Patrick Stox summing up a new player in the game, HTTP2. As Patrick mentions, HTTP2 has some major implications on your user experience by increasing the page load speed. He also hints that Google could one day turn this into a ranking signal. Laurent Vergnaud, CEO of web hosting company Themecloud.io, shares his insights on transferring to HTTP2, “HTTP2 will become the new standard in 2016. Every modern browser is already supporting it and hosting companies are starting to also. The ones who are not ready will be left behind.” Step Four: Redirect 404 Pages Even if you’re not the type to work up to your zero 404 errors in Google Search Console (or know what that means—no shame), it’s still a great idea to do some cleaning and redirecting of your dead pages. After all, Google is all about user experience. If a product is no longer available and you delete that page, your potential consumer might receive a 404 page. Not cool. Redirecting users with a 301 redirect—or, permanent redirect—is the best route to go. This 301 redirect passes around 90% of link love. So, for example, if your old product was ranking well for specific keyword terms, 90% of that will pass to the new page. I try to steer clear of 302 redirects—temporary redirects—mostly because it sends us 0% link love. If you do get stuck with a large amount of 404 errors, I recommend creating a custom 404 page. This will create a better user experience and contain a link to the previous page the user was on. You can also add a fun message. Here’re a few of my personal favorites: Taco Bell  Bluegg Blue Fountain Media If you have expired products that may be back in stock down the road, leave those pages up. Do not delete, unpublish, or redirect those pages. You can update the copy to inform consumers when the product will be back in stock. You can also offer an option for the consumers to be notified when the product is back in stock or to place on backorder. Here’s an example from Nordstrom: Here’s another great example from Bellroy: ADVERTISEMENT Step Five: Implement Pagination You’ve heard it time and again: Infinite scrolling equals a better user experience. And it’s true. However, infinite scrolling is not ideal for usability and negatively affects your search results on desktop and mobile.  But, as simple as it seems, there are a lot of opinions out there on what works best for e-commerce. In a recent study by the Baymard Institute, they break down pagination vs. the “load more” button vs. infinite scrolling. In my eyes, this seems to be SEO (Team Pagination) vs. UX designer (Team Infinite Scrolling). Pagination Pagination allows websites to divide content into smaller sections. By adding rel=”next”, rel=”prev” tags to specify which pages are part of a series, you’re helping the search engines understand the relationship between these pages. Google has put together this helpful guide on pagination that goes further into detail. If you’re implementing pagination to your e-commerce site, remember to add <meta name=”robots” content=”noindex, follow”> tags to all of the pages in the paginated series, except page one. This will ensure that only the first page in your series is indexed. Here’s an example from Macy’s: “Load More” Button The “load more” button allows the user to scroll through the product list without having to click to the next page. The load time is much faster and creates a better user experience. Here’s an example from Sketchers: While only 8% of the top 50 US e-commerce websites use the “Load more” approach, you can see how it’s appealing when attempting to grow you product list. Infinite Scrolling Infinite scrolling can delay the user from getting to your website footer. The user can see the footer for a second, but quickly the next round of results is shown. This can be harmful because your footer links help connect users your top navigation pages. Here’s an example from American Eagle Outfitters: So, who wins? The “Load more” button coupled with pagination answers the question for both user experience and SEO. This means setting a limit the “Load more” button will display. I keep mine between 25-75 products per search on the desktop. On mobile, I’d stick to 15-30 products per search. If you’re interested in learning more about best practices between infinite scrolling, the “load more” button, and pagination, check out this analysis by Dan McKinely, a product engineer for Etsy. Step Six: Canonicalize Products Figuring out what and how to canonicalize your e-commerce site is one of those mundane parts of maintaining a website that no one warns you about. Sure, you can publish a new product any time (and sometimes you do!), but being in charge of your canonicalization every day can get overwhelming. Let’s start with the basics. Step One:  Check for any domain canonicalization issues. Go to a category page on your website. Next, remove the “www” from the search bar and hit enter. If your domain is canonicalized, it will redirect to the correct version. If your domain is not correctly canonicalized, it will present you with a different page. Step Two: Add the rel=”canonical” tag to original product pages. By adding the rel=”canonical” tag to the original product page, you’re telling the search engines which product you want them to display. If you don’t have the rel=”canonical” tag to the original product page, then you could end up with duplicate products. Google gives us the lowdown on why having duplicate product isn’t good. If your site uses different URLs for sizes, colors, or whatever other product options, you’ll need to canonicalize the main product version.  If your site is using product options for example ‘/product-1?size=10’ then canonicalize the page back to the original version: ‘/product-1’. Step Seven: Cross-link your top pages. Chances are, unless you’ve spent time googling how to internal link as an e-commerce site, you’ve seen the power internal linking can have on your website. While this process is quite common among SEOs, it can often be forgotten for newbies. When you think of internal linking, you probably think of hyperlinking a keyword term to some slightly relevant page on your website or excessively linking to too many pages on your site. That’s not what I’m talking about. Internal linking allows you to guide the user from one page on your site to another. This improves user engagement and navigation. Here are some of the key benefits to internal linking: It gives your consumers additional options to engage on your site: If I’m writing a post on internal linking for SEO, I might hyperlink a great post from the post (like I just did). It increases your chance to rank for certain keywords: This is something to be very careful with. You don’t want to go hyperlinking all your keyword terms, but if it naturally fits, then link it. It helps the SERPs crawl your site: Internal links allow Google and other search engines to index your pages more efficiently. You want this internal link love to spread to your top navigations, so having a strategy in place for internal linking is extremely helpful. Still not convinced internal linking will do the trick? Hear it from John Mueller himself. In general, I don’t see any problems with internal links from articles on an e-commerce site. So if you are an expert on a topic, and you have products that belong to that topic, then maybe you will write some articles about this topic as well and give more insight on why you chose those products to sell, or the pros and cons, the variations of those products, and that is useful content to have. And that is something that sometimes does make sense to link to your product pages or the rest of your site. So that is not something I’d see as being overly problematic. If this is done in a reasonable way, that you are not linking every keyword to different pages on your site, but rather saying this product is important, this product is important here, this is something we offer, this is something someone else offers, this is a link to the manufacturer directly. Then that is useful information to have; that is not something I’d remove. If you’re feeling like a pro when it comes to internal linking, download Screaming Frog to use the ‘Inlinks’ tool to identify pages that are getting more attention. Step Eight: Create a sitemap. An XML (Extensible Markup Language) sitemap creates a readable format of your site for search engines. XML sitemaps are a list of the URLs on your website. If you’re an e-commerce site with lots of pages, it’s time to get familiar with XML sitemaps. Google states you can list up to 50,000 files in one sitemap. So, unless you’re Amazon or Microsoft, you might be able to get away with just one sitemap. However, when I’m working on e-commerce sites, I like to break down my sitemaps into different sections. Here’s what you can do: Products Only: This contains only individual products and needs to be updated as new products are added/removed.  Remember to update the <Last Modified> tag! Categories Only: This contains only the category pages. Boilerplate Pages: This contains the basics like “contact us”, “about us”, etc. Editorial Pages: This contains links to any editorial content (e.g. articles, informational sections). Blog: This contains links to your blog pages. Be sure to list all individual posts, tags, author pages, and archives. Make sure to ping the search engines after you’ve created a sitemap. I do this by submitting my XML sitemaps to Google Search Console once they are completed. Step Nine: Optimize for mobile. With the launch of Google AMP pages and Google announcing mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal, I think it’s safe to say that if you’re not on board with mobile optimization by now, then you’ll be left on page 50 of Google’s search results. And, you’ve probably noticed a trend on your site with mobile driving more traffic to your site than other avenues. Yotpo collected data from 65 million e-commerce orders over 120,000 e-commerce stores in 2015 and found that search made up 34%. That’s pretty huge! If you’re not mobile-optimized yet, then follow these steps: Design for mobile: This means creating call-to-action buttons above the fold, creating mobile versions of your pages, making the buttons bigger, and so much more. This now includes creating Google AMP pages for your blogs or article pages. Decide on mobile configuration: You can choose between a responsive design, dynamic serving, or separate URLs. Do not block javascript, CSS, or images in your robots.txt. Create mobile-friendly images to increase page load speed: Stick with image files smaller than 70 KB. To check to see if your site is mobile optimized, head over to Google’s mobile-friendly test. Step Ten: Page speed. If you manage a website, you know that improving page speed can be difficult to crack down. In fact, every website owner you know can probably recall an instance (or ten) when your site wasn’t loading fast enough. Luckily, there are tools you can use now to help guide us through this process. Jump over to Google’s Page Speed test and enter your domain, click “Analyze”, and watch the magic happen. Once it’s finished, Google helps you diagnose what may be slowing down your site. Some of the common quick fixes for page speed include: Reduce the page size to keep page load times to three seconds or less. Use a content delivery network to cache your content. Compress data sent to the browser. Upgrade your hosting server. Add image sizes to help search engines create placeholders. 4. On-Site SEO I don’t know about you, but when I get to on-page SEO, I tend to optimize a full product category (or two) with a whole lot more than just the title tag and description tag. In fact, there’s a whole land of overlooked potential in the on-site SEO section—it’s just taken me a while to tap into it. But, I’m majorly glad I did. If you’re living in the ’90s, you may think that long-tail keyword terms and on-site SEO don’t mix, but I’m here to prove otherwise. Let’s take a look at what I see as a fully on-site SEO optimized e-commerce page. As Beyonce would say, flawless. On-page SEO: We all have the opportunity to implement these strategies above, but rarely do I see brands ticking all the boxes. I cherish my on-page SEO—and, I’m all about flaunting the brands that are doing it well. So, what makes a perfect product page? For some, it’s all about customer reviews. Others may judge a product page by how well their images look. And, for a lot of people in the SEO arena, it all boils down to who does the best copywriting. But regardless of whether you care more about a video tutorial or pricing strategies that won’t break that bank, I believe all great product pages have one thing in common: They all have a really, really good SEO guru working on their page. Sure, it may sound simple. I searched near and far and narrowed it down to these essential on-page SEO elements that never disappoint. And, if you have a favorite that didn’t make the list, let me know in the comments — I’m always looking for an excuse to meta-tag-stalk brands. URL We’ve all heard the same URL advice over and over again: A keyword-rich URL and a unique, clean, short structure will get you far. True, but what happens when your site gets so big you have to add parameters? Search engines do have the ability to ignore these ugly parameters (ex:?%20), but having a descriptive URL gives you yet another opportunity to improve user experience and increase rankings. A potential consumer viewing a URL that’s long and filled with a bunch of gibberish may lose confidence and move onto the next site. If you are using parameters, ask your developer to work with you on rewriting the rules. Here are a few guidelines to stick with: Use only lowercase characters. Use hyphens (-) as word separators instead of spaces and underscores. Delete all special characters, including exclamation points and apostrophes. Delete all encoding that includes structures like %30, %5B. Here’s an example from Made.com: Meta Title I love nothing more than when my meta titles increase my click-through rate. It could be something as (not-so) subtle as my keyword placement or simply reinforcing brand value. But one of my favorite talking points speaks to the idea of adding action words to our meta titles. These action words can help you target more long-tail keyword terms, which is always a bonus. Here are some examples of action words brands are using in their meta titles: Click Learn Decide Choose Try Shop Free Sale Buy Now Best Hurry Download Limited Time Win Exclusive Plus! Here is an example of action words being using in the meta title: Meta Description As click-through rate becomes an increasingly important factor in SEO (as Paul Haahr, Google Ranking Engineer stated at SMX West) it’s vital that e-commerce brands learn how to optimize their title tags to boost CTR. Let me be clear; your meta description may not improve your search rankings alone, but it will earn you more clicks when optimized correctly. Here are a few tips for optimizing your meta description: Keep it at about 155 characters. Think of this as writing a headline for an article. Give an answer to a question. For example, look at this result from Dr. Foster’s & Smith answering my question on how to choose the right dog collar. Make sure you’re specific to your target audience with your keywords. For example, Crocs connects with their consumers by writing a meta description that targets summer sales based on seasonal changes. There are a ton, and I mean a ton, of words and phrases that can help increase your click-through rate in the search engines. Here are some of my favorites: You Instantly Guarantee New Free Shipping Sale Gregory Ciotti described more about this style of persuasive copywriting in a post for Copyblogger. For instance, words like “new” trigger us to respond to brands that are already established. He used the example “New Coke”. David Ogilvy, the father of advertising, shared this list of the 20 most influential words in 1963: Suddenly Now Announcing Introducing Improvement Amazing Sensational Remarkable Revolutionary Startling Miracle Magic Offer Quick Easy Wanted Challenge Compare Bargain Hurry Here’s an example of these words in action: Body Copy You’ve probably heard the saying, “You never get a second chance to make a first impression.” As heart-rending as that thought is, as an SEO consultant, I happen to believe there’s truth to this adage. And, it couldn’t be more applicable than with SEO—the land of competing keywords, A/B targeting headline titles, high-stake conversions, and impressionable consumers. So how do you make sure you’re not paying for a do-over that will most likely never come your way? Step one: Write some cool descriptions for your products. Step two: Spritz in some keywords. See? I told you it was simple! Below, peek through my tips and examples for optimizing the body copy for your e-commerce site, all from the big guys to the newbies of e-commerce. I know a thing or two about commanding attention from the consumer in the SERPs. Are you taking notes? Step One: Write 1000+ Words You may have heard that long-form content ranks better in Google, well this applies to your e-commerce product pages as well. The more content you can share with the consumer, the more Google can correctly place your site. If you don’t have enough content or worse, duplicate content (eek!), you could get hit with a Google Panda penalty.  In fact, Ebay lost more than of 33% of its organic traffic from their content being too thin. The problem: Writing 1000+ words for every single product can get boring fast. But, the truth is, you can tap into other sections of your product page to hit this 1000+ word count. Here are a some super secret ways to hit 1000+ word goal for your e-commerce product pages: Write 50-100 words for your product description. Highlight the technical specs including brand, model, color, size, etc. AO.com goes in-depth about product specs. Incorporate key features and product benefits. ASOS provides consumers with additional options in their product descriptions. Utilize your customer reviews. Modcloth is an awesome example. Answer consumer questions in a FAQ section. Optimizely stated that Roller Skate Nation increased their conversions by 69% when they added an FAQ to their product page. Here are a few things to NOT do with your product page descriptions: Scrape content from other sites. Keyword stuffing your product descriptions. Thin content. Here’s an example from Hermes: Use the manufacturers description. For example, copy and paste this description from Wal-Mart into the Google search box. You’ll see this is being duplicated across 3,000+ sites.   Step Two: Incorporate 3-5 keywords.  After you write your product description, take a few minutes to have a look back at your copy. Did you include 3-5 of your keyword terms or phrases? This is not about keyword stuffing. This is to ensure the search engines understand what your product page is about so they can index you appropriately. For instance, if you’re targeting “work shirt” you’d want to make sure you incorporate variations of this keyword term in your product description 3-5 times. Here’s an example from J. Peterman: J.Peterman incorporated keyword terms associated with his head term “work shirt” like “lady’s work shirt” and “tunics for work”. Check out the keyword research section above for further info on how to intertwine these long-tail keyword terms with your head terms. Internal Links A show of hands: Who’s already putting internal links on their product pages? Yes, friends, it’s true: Internal linking on your product pages is necessary.  Strategically linking from high-authority pages to high-priority product and category pages are typically already done on your homepage and blog page. For example, if you put together a blog post like Kiddicare did here on co-sleeping safety AND you also have product page links, you’re increasing your chances to rank for these product pages. But how and where do you link on product pages? Here are a few options: Breadcrumb navigation: This gives us tiny text that makes each word an internal link. Here’s an example from Amazon: Related products: This allows you to upsell other products by showing thumbnails at the bottom. Here’s an example from Urban Outfitters: Related categories: You can help dress an overall theme or direction for the user by linking them to relevant categories. Here’s an example from Overstock: Overall, the internal linking strategy should be designed to provide value to users rather than to cheat the search engine results pages. The result should be an internal linking structure that is intuitive for users and naturally prioritizes the most important content with the most relevant keywords. Social Media Share Buttons We all know you need to be active on social media for your business. But, do you need social media share buttons on your product pages? The short answer: Yes. Social media share buttons give you the potential for free promotion on social channels. And, while social media doesn’t directly affect your rankings in the search engines, having a product that is often shared and an engaging page does help your rankings. A study from ShareThis showed that millennial shoppers are twice as likely to buy a product they’ve personally shared on social media. It’s worth integrating. Here are some tips for incorporating social media share buttons: Remove the share counter from the buttons. A/B test different types of buttons. Use smaller buttons so as not to distract from conversions. Add social media share buttons to the check-out page. Luvd.com does an excellent job at customizing their social media share buttons on their product pages. Check it out: Images I’m going to say it: A beautiful image is nothing without ALT tags. There it is. Just because you spent $20k on a photo shoot with a world-renowned photographer doesn’t mean anything if you don’t properly tag your images. Your images will never appear in search. While gorgeous product images can increase conversion rates, there’s so much more you can do to get the most out of them. Let’s walk through how to get the most out of your images in the SERPs below: Use a keyword-rich descriptive term to name your file name before uploading to your site. For example, Birchbox named this file beautyprotector_protect_detangle_new_900x900.jpg. If you right click the image, then  “open image in a new tab” you’ll be able to see what the image file is named. Always add your image dimensions and sizes to the file name as you see in the example above from Birchbox. Write a keyword-rich descriptive alt tag after your file is uploaded. For example, let’s look at this Threadless t-shirt image. The image alt tag is “You Are My Universe – small view.” Not the best image alt tag, but I’ll take it. To find the image alt tag, just right click then select “view page source”. Hit control+f on your keyword to and search for “alt”. You’ll come across a selection of alt tag options but look for the images associated with jpg or png files. Adjust file size or compress your file images to make sure you’re not slowing down your page speed. Amazon could lose $1.6 billion a year if their pages slow down by one second. I try to keep my images below 70kb. Square is a great example of how to create gorgeous product images: Harry’s is another example of beautiful product images: And bill blass is another favorite: Product Videos You click on the tees category on your favorite store’s website. You keep scrolling. You get to the product you’ve been looking for, and you can see your soon-to-be-new-favorite tee in video format. You are living it before you buy it. Awesome, right? Animoto found that 73% of consumers were more likely to buy a product or sign up for a service if they watch a branded video that explains the product. Quicksprout discovered that video could drive 12% of users to buy the product. And Digiday stated that 52% of consumers said watching videos makes them more confident about their purchase decisions. Think video is worth an investment yet? In addition to increasing conversion rates, adding product videos to your website can help improve search engine rankings. Video increases engagement and time on-site, therefore increasing your chances for ranking your product pages higher in the SERPs.  Videos also give you an opportunity to differentiate yourself from your competitors. You need to invest time and money when you’re creating product videos. Let’s take a look at some of my favorite product page videos: Shwoods Shop has gorgeous video imagery: Home Depot partnered with brands to create product videos: And, of course, how could I talk about awesome product videos without including Zappos: Here are a few tips when crafting your product videos: Keep it short and sweet. Try to keep the video under one minute. Keep it simple. Don’t add fancy filters to your products, give the consumers the real deal. Hire a professional. There is a huge difference between a homemade product video and a professionally designed product video—and your audience knows it. Conclusion Now it’s time for you to implement the tactics from this step-by-step guide. How do you think you’ll use tips from this guide? Do you have any questions?

All These SEO instructions for eCommerce website are very useful. Anna Crowe Glad it was so helpful! Long tail keywords can be sometimes difficult to grasp so I’m glad my description was useful 🙂 Bruce Mesnekoff Thanks for Information about SEO. Your Article is impressive and very informative. I am now regular visitor of your website and bookmarked it. MM85 Fantastic and incredibly in-depth article Anna! Thanks for writing! One question though: on some e-commerce sites, soft 404 errors are a big issue, and many times there aren’t relevant enough products or pages to replace them. Google mentions that having standard 404 errors are a completely natural part of a website experience and we won’t be penalized for that. That being said, obviously the best course of action is to create a custom 404 page to improve user experience. Don’t you think it’s a bit dangerous to recommend 301 redirecting 404 pages? I feel that will just create more soft 404 pages and mess with the crawl budget. Maybe I read it wrong though and you didn’t mean it that way! Either way, thanks for this! Amazing article. – Mike Yuvraj I don’t think 301s on URL’s would mess with the crawl budget. What you are simply doing is taking your user to an appropriate page on your website instead instead of a URL that does not exist. Andy Morley Really well written, but it’s a back to basics guide in my opinion. It is also very broad and most of this can apply to all types of websites not just ecommerce… Scott Evans Hi Hatem, my preference here is always the second option. Products should live in their own folder structure, because it allows a product to effectively live in 2 (or more) categories without creating a duplicate content problem. I’m sure exceptions exist like the one you pointed out. wellstar The article by itself is thorough and an impressive piece of work. Unfortunatly you had nothing to add to the already existing guides on the topic and thus begs the question: why writing it at all? You left out a lot of concepts that are already well established – or maybe it’s just the people I work with. Also: while SSL is said to be a ranking factor (and it makes a lot of sense, too) recent studies by major SEO software companies have found no indication between SSL and improvements in ranking – so far. This article is a good start and if one is new to the topic it is a pretty neat ressource and starting point. One can be happy if he already does everything mentioned here. For those already experienced in the topic – this is the basic stuff and I expect everyone working in SEO to already do all those things for their (clients) ecommerce sites.

The app’s USP is the quick and easy setup — no login required. It also offers encrypted communication and Google’s intelligent algorithms that will scale video quality to bandwidth. It does sound intriguing, doesn’t it? I don’t use video calling much myself, and when I do, Messenger and FaceTime have been more than adequate. Installing the app is as simple as installing any other app. You go to either here or here, depending on whether you’re on iOS or Android respectively, and install. Once installed, you agree to the terms and conditions, enter your phone number, enter the confirmation code once received, give the requisite permissions and that’s it! This I can get used to. Setup is as simple as setting WhatsApp or Telegram and there are no login details to remember. The only reason I stopped using Skype was that I could never remember my username or password. Tapping on the video button throws up your contacts and those on Duo and those not are segregated. You can send invites to the latter or simply tap on the former to chat with them. It’s a simple enough UI and I quite like the simplicity. I went ahead and decided to chat with my cousin for a bit. He was on a bus and on the move (signal varying between 3G and 4G), while I was pacing the office balcony, dropping in and out of Wi-Fi range. I can’t think of a more ideal scenario for stress testing Duo’s capabilities, barring a 2G trial of course. He was on a Xiaomi Mi 5 and I was on an iPhone 6S Plus. The results were surprising. The app would intelligently switch between Wi-Fi and 4G, notifying me when it did. The video would cut out when switching, but Audio remained mostly intact. I could see the video quality degrading as my cousin moved in and out of 3G and 4G, but as before, audio remained intact. I was also pleasantly surprised by the fact that there was no noticeable lag in the audio and video streaming and conversations felt like they were happening in real-time. My battery hit the 20 percent mark while chatting and as expected, the iOS’ Low Battery Notification popped up. At the same time, Duo offered to turn off video to conserve battery. This was a nice touch. I’m impressed. The app is very fast and responsive, setup was a breeze and the calls were handled very well. However, I don’t know if I really need the app yet. All my Friends are on WhatsApp and for whatever limited video calling I do, Messenger and FaceTime have more than adequate. The sheer convenience of Duo might convince me to change my mind, but if WhatsApp were to get video calling, I doubt I’ll bother with something like Duo.

(Photo: Ford Motor Company) PALO ALTO, Calif. – Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday it plans to deploy a fully autonomous and driverless ride-hailing car by 2021. CEO Mark Fields set the target at Ford’s Research and Innovation facility here, which will double its staff to 300 and grow its footprint by 150,000 square feet by year’s end to respond to the challenge. “This is one example of how we’re thinking about expanding our business into mobility more broadly,” Fields told USA TODAY. “Taking the driver out of the equation improves the economics for us as well as consumers.” Currently, Ford is testing around a dozen self-driving Ford Fusion Hybrids on California, Michigan and Arizona roads. Its goal is to introduce cars with no steering wheels or pedals. The car's powertrain has yet to be decided, but Ford executives stressed that for commercial applications such as ride hailing a more flexible gas-electric hybrid engine may be preferable to pure electric. Google leads the way in this arena with a seven-year self-driving program whose vehicles have logged more than 1.5 million miles in four states. Other automakers are also targeting a similar delivery date, with BMW and Volvo separately announcing last month that they would have a self-driving car by 2021. Some 33 companies are developing autonomous car tech, from Audi to Volkswagen, according to CB Insights. USA TODAY BMW says it will deliver self-driving car by 2021 Notably, Ford is echoing Google with autonomous vehicles that humans simply can't drive — they have no steering wheels. Ford's future vehicles would act as short-distance, low-speed shuttles in dense urban areas. That’s the kind of environment where the major ride-hailing companies — Uber and Lyft — have flourished. Uber, in fact, has already set up its own division to develop a self-driving car. When asked whether Ford planned to develop its own ride-hailing service or sell its cars to an existing service, Fields said, “all options are on the table.” Ford plans to have 30 Fusions testing its autonomous car tech by the end of this year, and nearly 100 in 2017. “We’re aiming for Level 4 automation with this vehicle,” said Ford CTO Raj Nair, referring to the Society of Automotive Engineers standard, where Level 1 is a human-guided vehicle and 5 requires no human input regardless of the environment. Nair said Level 4 offers full autonomy “but in a geo-fenced area that is very heavily 3D mapped.” In other words, a typical city center. Ford will continue to invest in driver-assist features that will be added to traditional vehicles, Nair said. But in conducting research on car technology that is semi-autonomous, doing most of the driving while relying on the human in certain situations, Ford discovered certain risks. “Bringing the driver back quickly can be difficult to manage,” he said. As a result, Ford decided to develop a car that clearly delineates when a driver is, and isn’t, necessary. USA TODAY Audi pioneers cars that will 'talk' to traffic signals With its new goal of a driverless autonomous car in five years, Ford is aligning itself with Google. A pioneer in the space, the Internet giant has taken a different tack than Tesla, which continues to develop models with a high degree of technology that also require the driver to remain vigilant. Its Autopilot feature came under fire after an owner of the electric sedan was killed when his car ignored a truck cutting across its path and he didn’t respond quickly enough to avoid the collision. Ford has been on an investment and partnership tear of late after the first half of 2016 saw rivals such as General Motors, Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler ink deals with Cruise Automation, Gett and Google respectively in an effort to lead the autonomous car charge. Earlier Tuesday, Ford announced that it was co-leading a $150 million investment with Chinese search giant Baidu in Velodyne Lidar, which makes a critical laser radar component for self-driving vehicles. Last month, Ford participated in a $6.6 million seed round for 3D mapping company, Civil Maps. Ford and Chinese search giant Baidu announced they will be investing $150M in Velodyne, which makes laser radar devices that are integral to the development of self-driving cars.  (Photo: Velodyne) In addition to those deals, Ford also announced Tuesday that it had purchased Israeli-based computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS (data crunching power that can help a self-driving car navigate new surroundings), and inked a licensing agreement with Nirenberg Neuroscience (a machine vision company whose technology helps cars decode their environment). Fields shrugged off suggestions that Ford was arriving late to the autonomous-car investment party with its new slate of deals. “We always invest in the long term, we’re not in a race to make announcements but instead find the right fits for our business and our customers,” he said. “People who succumb to short term moves aren’t looking at it right.” USA TODAY Google loses longtime self-driving car guru Fields said he will continue to seek out companies whose “technology and cultures represent a good fit for Ford,” offering such enterprises as a lure the “possibility of making a dent in the universe with their work in the field of mobility.” Ford’s bet on a self-driving future is being spurred by a softening of the automotive market, which is not expected to match the 17.5 million cars sold in 2015. Contributing to this trend are a host of factors, including the high quality and prevalence of slightly used cars and a growing trend toward allocating funds for a second vehicle toward ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft.

The latest Samsung smartphone currently runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.  ( Samsung ) Advertisement The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 could get Android 7.0 Nougat software update as early as October this year. It is very likely that Google will launch and release its 2016 Nexus phones, code-named Marlin and Sailfish, in October. These devices will be the first ones to come running on Android 7.0 Nougat. Google normally releases its latest mobile operating system to other Nexus devices. The update is then rolled out to international models of smartphones followed by devices on individual carriers. Koh Dong-jin, the president of Mobile Communications at Samsung Electronics, has disclosed that beta testing of Android 7.0 Nougat for the Galaxy Note 7 will begin soon. "It is very important for us to offer up-to-date information with the new OS, but what's more crucial is to build a stable and seamless platform for users," said Koh. "That's why we are planning to do enough beta testing before any OS updates." Market experts believe that Samsung will roll out Android 7.0 Nougat for the international variant of the Galaxy Note 7 in Korea during the software's early rollout stage. The Galaxy Note 7 in other regions including the United States may have to wait longer, probably until 2017, to receive the software update. Some customers in the United States may also have to wait even longer as some carriers release software updates swiftly while others take their time. For instance, the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ were launched in August 2015 running on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Although Google released Android 6.0 Marshmallow in October 2015, AT&T customers who have those smartphone models had to wait until June this year to receive the update. Sprint and Verizon Wireless rolled out Android 6.0 Marshmallow to its Galaxy Note 5 a bit earlier in March. Meanwhile, Android 7.0 Nougat is expected to bring a number of new features to the table. Customers will be able to install apps faster on their devices running on the OS. Users will also find better battery management features in the software. New security patches will be automatically downloaded silently in the background and they will be ready to use when the device is restarted. Samsung has many smartphones that are expected to receive the Android 7.0 Nougat update, but the company has not confirmed the rollout date for the software. The Galaxy Note 7 being the latest handset should be one of the first Samsung phones to get Google's upcoming update. At this point, it remains to be seen how swiftly Android 7.0 Nougat makes its way to the Galaxy Note 7 and other Samsung devices.

It’s an operating system called Fuchsia, which could run on just about anything. A decade ago Google was just a search engine and advertiser, but now it’s the driving force behind the largest computing platform in the world: Android. Even the slow-to-start Chrome OS has been picking up steam in recent years, dominating the budget laptop market. Both these products are based in part on Linux, but Google is working on something completely new, and you can take a peek at it on Github. It’s an operating system called Fuchsia, which could run on just about anything. Google and many other companies make use of the Linux kernel for a variety of reasons. The robustness of features is certainly part of it, but it’s also freely available under the GPL license. Anyone can use the Linux kernel in a project, provided they make the open source components available to end users and developers. So, what about Fuchsia? According to the GitHub page, “Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System).” Google’s mysterious new Fuchsia OS is based on a completely different kernel known as Magenta. This is a microkernel, which itself is based on a different project called LittleKernel. The intended use for Magenta was as part of an embedded system like you might see on routers or set-top boxes. It seems that Google wants to use it for more than that now. Magenta is designed to be lightweight, but it can scale up to be the basis for more powerful systems. Google’s Fuchsia page notes that the project is targeted at “modern phones and modern personal computers’ that have fast processors and lots of RAM. Building something open from scratch gives Google much more freedom to make exactly what it needs. The Linux kernel has been around for about 25 years and is used in all manner of applications. Many developers have contributed code over that time, and as a result it’s a little ungainly. Many of the security exploits found in Android these days are actually faults in the Linux kernel. Google is testing Fuchsia on a variety of devices like Intel NUCs and Acer laptops. There is also support for the Raspberry Pi 3 on the way. Google is currently using a system called Flutter for the interface and Dart as the programming language. But what’s Google going to do with Fuchsia? It’s possible Google management isn’t even sure. This could just become another abandoned project before it has a chance to replace anything. Still, some have speculated that Google could see Fuchsia as the next step for Android, Chrome OS, or both. Migrating to a new platform probably means breaking compatibility with existing software (or emulating it in some way), so this is not something to be done lightly. Perhaps Fuchsia is something completely new for Google — a robust full desktop OS alternative to Chrome OS. Whatever Google has planned for Fuchsia, nothing is changing at the moment.         LATEST STORIES (79) Iran, Azerbaijan Discuss Defense Ties Iran, Indonesia Stress Boosting Cooperation on Human Rights Iran Calls for Collective Efforts to Fight Terrorism UNHCR Official: Iran's Supports for Refugees "Unmatched" US Gives Green Light to Airbus on Sale of over 100 Passenger Planes to Iran Rouhani Felicitates Lebanon on Independence Day Iran, UNIDO Ink Country Program Framework Syrian Commander: Popular Uprising against Terrorists Starts in Eastern Aleppo Battle for Mosul Day 37: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Completes Siege of Tal Afar Israel 'Revives' Eastern Jerusalem Settler Homes Plan Hashd Al-Shaabi Wins Back Several More Villages Near Mosul Libyan Forces Press Forward Against ISIL in Sirte Iranian Speaker: Establishment of Democracy Impossible by Supporting Terrorism in Syria Envoy: Damascus against Proposals to Create Autonomous Areas in Syria Moscow: UN Envoy 'Sabotaging' Syria Resolution Iran, Azerbaijan Discuss Defense Ties TEHRAN (FNA)- Iran's Ambassador to Baku Javad Jahangirzadeh and Azeri Defense Minister General Zakir Hasanov in a meeting in Baku discussed military cooperation between the two countries.

Today, the company finally launched the FaceTime rival, which is designed solely for smartphones. The app is available on both Android and iOS, and unlike many of the company’s other products, you don’t require a Google account to use it. Duo works in the same way as WhatsApp: users register and find other people via their phone number. Google is pushing Duo’s simplicity as its main selling point. It doesn’t have the kind of features found in Skype or Hangouts, such as conference calls, and the company believes this will appeal to consumers. “Users are reluctant to video call because they don’t know if the other person is on the right network, the right device or it’s a good time to call. We’ve tried to remove all that friction and make it feel like an invitation, not an interruption when someone call’s you,” Amit Fulay, Google’s group manager for communications, told The Guardian. “Duo is all about simplicity and quality. It’s all about video calling. There are no frills, no knobs or dials to adjust, it just works.” Duo does, however, come with a unique feature called “Knock Knock.” When a person receives a call, they’ll see a full-screen live video feed of the caller even before they answer. The person making the call gets a notice informing them that “your video is visible,” so they know not to pick their nose or anything while waiting for someone to answer. The feature may sound a bit worrying, but you only receive Knock Knocks from people in your contact list. It can be disabled completely, and on the iPhone it only works if you’re in the app, otherwise you just get a notification when someone calls. Duo fully encrypts all calls and adjusts the video resolution automatically depending on the speed of your connection. It can even keep a call going should you decide to switch from Wi-Fi to cellular. You can register to download here. While some have praised Duo’s simplicity and clean interface, there are those who say it’s these elements that make it dull. The video calling market is a crowded one, but a combination of Knock Knock and not having to create an account could help Duo stick out from the rest of the pack. Google's app may not replace FaceTime for iPhone users, but it does have potential on Android – early user reviews are overwhelmingly positive. Duo is rolling out worldwide on the Play Store and App Store over the next few days.

It uses your phone number to sign in unlike most video call apps. (Google) Duo, the one-to-one video calling app launched on Tuesday in India, is Google’s statement of intent in what is widely seen as the future of communication. The app is currently available on Android and iOS globally in 78 languages. It uses your phone number to sign in unlike most video call apps. “Duo seamlessly transitions between Wi-Fi and cellular networks, so you can start a call on one network and switch to another without dropping your call... even on slow networks (such as 2G),” Amit Fulay, product manager of Duo, told HT. “While 31% of Indian adult users video call every day, 67% of them say poor connectivity or dropped calls frustrate them with video call,” said Justin Uberti, principal software engineer at Google. The app comes with a knock feature that lets the receiver of the call see what the caller is doing at the other end. (Google) Analysts are sceptical. “Less than 5% of the Indian internet user base, roughly around 300 million, connects via video calls every day. Duo might not make a huge impact in the market,” said Pavel Naiya, research analyst at Counterpoint Research. “For video calling to be a mainstream phenomenon, cellular networks have to better and more stable.” “In fact, audio calls on WhatsApp consumes up to nearly 20 MB which is really high in terms of data, but the quality is poor,” Naiya said. Skype and other video calling apps are in Google’s crosshairs. Just after Duo was announced, Google said its Hangouts will shift focus away from consumers and Duo will take its place. Skype leads the video-calling space with roughly has 300 million users as of March 2016. “Skype has a huge consumer base and Duo will take time to catch up,” Naiya said. Facebook-owned WhatsApp is also working on video calls. WhatsApp declined to comment on its India numbers. Skype did not respond.

Here's what's going on with Chromebooks in education today and how to pick the right one for you and the students in your life. By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | August 16, 2016 -- 20:18 GMT (13:18 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Chances are the students in your family are already using a Chromebook. According to Futuresource Consulting, Chromebooks accounted for 56 percent of K-12 school market sales. It's not just elementary and high schools. IDC reports that Chromebooks sales are now well ahead of Apple Mac sales. Chromebooks are great laptops for school kids from four years to 40 years old. Why? Because Chromebooks are cheaper, safer, and faster than Windows 10 laptops and Mac laptops. For example, laptops are stolen every day. If your school work is in there, you're out of luck. But, if you use a Chromebook, it's no big deal. By default, all your papers, email, and notes are safe on the Google cloud. You can get your work back by buying a new Chromebook, then signing into your Google account, and you're back to business again. If you got your Chromebook from a school, Google has made it easy to disable stolen or lost Chromebooks. This makes them a useless target for any thief. Schools also have other reasons to prefer that students use Chromebooks. Google offers a suite of programs just for schools, called Google Apps for Education Suite, as well as a class-specific ChromeOS and Android apps, called Google Play for Education, and Chromebooks that come with Google Play for Education at prices ranging from $199 to $227. In addition, with a $30 management fee, schools can manage Chromebooks. By Google's count, for schools, Chromebooks have a 61 percent lower total cost of ownership over Windows PC. They also take 91 percent less time to deploy. Based on my experiences with both Windows PCs and Chromebooks, those numbers sound right to me. Why? Because, for example, Chromebooks require no anti-virus programs and automatically update with the latest patches without any trouble. The upfront price is right. Valerie Truesdale, technology chief for North Carolina's Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system, was quoted in The Journal: "HP came in with a bid that is about $220 per device, which is significant when you're trying to provision 32,000, price is key." Those same advantages work as well for you as they do for schools. For example, Chromebooks boot-up in less than 10 seconds. Generally speaking, they have great battery life. And, as the cash-strapped school systems have noticed, Chromebooks cost far less than equivalent Windows laptops, and let's not even talk about MacBook prices. Some people are still under the illusion that Chromebooks can't be used when they're offline. That's not true. I write documents, answer emails, read ebooks, listen to music, and watch movies on my Chromebooks without a Wi-Fi signal to be found. I'm just as productive on my Chromebooks when I'm offline as I am when I'm using Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows desktop without an internet connection. Besides, as a work colleague in New Zealand told me, "The schools here in New Zealand are heavy consumers of Chromebooks. They perform really well; no one has complaints, and the more adventurous students install Crouton [which enables you to run Linux on a Chromebook] and compile silly demo apps they download from wxPython, FLTK, or any given open-source framework site." In addition, on some newer Chromebooks, you can now run Android apps. With 1.5 million Android apps, I think we can safely say now that Chromebooks will do just fine for almost any use without a Wi-Fi connection. So, which is the best Chromebook for your school use? My recommendations are in the gallery below, but you might want to consider getting a used Chromebook instead of a new one. You see, it doesn't take much of a processor, RAM, or storage for Chromebooks to run well. Top five 2016 Chromebooks for school and... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 6 NEXT PREV Until recently, I was still using my June 2011 Samsung Series 5, the first commercial Chromebook. I only got rid of it because I didn't need it anymore. It's still working just fine today. While I wouldn't recommend getting a Series 5, even used 2014 models such as the Acer Chromebook C720P or HP Chromebook 11 cost only about $150 and run as well as ever. You see, unlike Windows PCs or Macs, Chromebook don't get cluttered with junk software or the remains of old, uninstalled programs. Additionally, Chrome OS is very lightweight. It doesn't require the latest hardware to work well. When considering a used Chromebook, you should also keep in mind that while clearing personal data off a Mac or Windows PC can be a titanic struggle, getting rid of personal information on a Chromebook is a snap. Just take the following steps: Sign in to your Chromebook. Click the status area where your account picture appears. Click Settings > Show advanced settings. In the Powerwash section, click Reset. Click Restart, and then don't sign in with your Google account. Whoever logs into the Chromebook next is its new primary owner. That's all there is to it. That means you can trust a used Chromebook to not have malware hiding on it. It also means that it's safe and easy to move on to another Chromebook when the one you're currently using doesn't meet your needs anymore. So, what should you be looking for in a Chromebook? Generally speaking, RAM isn't a problem: 2GB is enough, though 4GB is better but not necessary. The processor also doesn't have to be that fast. If all you're going to do is light web work, say Google Docs and email, even the slowest CPU will be fine. That said, if you want more oomph, you'll want to avoid ARM processors and look to the faster Intel CPUs. One thing you will want is 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Chromebooks can work without Wi-Fi, but they show to their best advantage with a fast Wi-Fi connection. Of course, if your school only still supports 802.11n Wi-Fi, you don't need to worry about it. Like on all networks, you can only go as fast as the slowest link. In this case that would be the 802.11n Wi-Fi's real-world maximum of 100Mbps. Storage? Don't worry about it. True, Chromebooks don't come with much storage. They average 16GB to 32GB of solid state drive (SSD) storage or up to 500GB of hard drive space. Don't worry about it! Chromebooks store almost all your data on Google Drive. And, by the way, whenever you buy a new Chromebook, you get two years of at least 100GBs of free Google Drive storage. You also can't run Windows PC or Mac-specific programs on a Chromebook. You can, however, run Microsoft Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, such as Office 365, in a Chromebook. If you absolutely must run a Windows or macOS specific program, you can run them remotely with Chrome Remote Desktop or Chrome RDP. If your school uses Citrix for virtual Windows desktops, you can also run Windows apps from your Chromebook with Citrix Receiver. If you're going to take any of these paths, you want to use a Chromebook with a fast x86 processor and not an ARM CPU. The bottom line is Chromebooks are great for students and they are none-too shabby for any users. I've largely replaced my use of high-end Lenovo ThinkPads with Chromebooks, because they cost less and work better for my purposes. Give one a try, and you may become a Chromebook fan too.

Home construction in the U.S. accelerated in July to the fastest pace in five months. While housing starts were up 2.1 percent nationally, new construction was up 15.5 percent in the Northeast, led by a surge in new apartment and condo construction.

Barnes & Noble ousts CEO Struggling bookseller Barnes & Noble says its chief executive officer is departing after just a year. The company's board says it determined Ronald D. Boire was not a good fit for the company and it is in the “best interests of all parties” for him to step down. The company did not give specifics. Executive chairman and former CEO Leonard Riggio, who was scheduled to retire Sept. 14, will postpone his retirement. A search for a new CEO will begin immediately. Barnes & Noble is working on a turnaround plan involving cutting costs and closing stores after years of weak results. Boire previously worked as CEO of Sears Canada. Ford eyes 2021 for fully autonomous car Ford Motor Co. says it will have a fully autonomous vehicle ready to provide ride-hailing or ride-sharing services by 2021. Ford CEO Mark Fields announced the goal Tuesday at the company's Silicon Valley campus in Palo Alto, Calif. Ford said its vehicle won't need a steering wheel or gas and brake pedals. That's a break from many other companies, who plan to gradually add self-driving capability to traditional cars. Ford's vehicle will be specifically designed for commercial mobility services, such as taxi companies, and will be available in high volumes. Ford said self-driving cars for standard consumers will be offered later. Google Duo app joins video calling market Google's video chatting app has arrived. The app, dubbed Duo, represents Google's response to other popular video calling options, including Apple's FaceTime, Microsoft's Skype and Facebook's Messenger app. Duo isn't much different from the other video chatting services, except that it gives a glimpse at who is making the call, helping the recipient decide whether to answer. Google calls this feature, “Knock, knock.” The app is a free service for phones running on Google's Android operating system as well as Apple's iPhones. Like FaceTime for iPhones, Duo only requires a person's phone number to connect. Many other services require both participants to have account logins to use their video calling options. Shell subsidiary to build link to cracker A subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plans to build a 94-mile pipeline system to deliver ethane from three shale gas processing plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio to the petrochemical facility it will build in Beaver County. Shell said it will move about 100,000 barrels per day on the so-called Falcon Ethane Pipeline System once it is operational between the facility in Potter and Center, and processing stations in Houston, Pa., and Scio and Cadiz, Ohio. Construction is expected to begin in late 2018. Shell Pipeline Co. this month began acquiring rights of way on land. Next year, Shell plans to start building its plant, which will convert liquid ethane from shale gas wells into the building blocks of plastics. Home construction jumps in July Apartment construction in the Northeast fueled a jump in home building in July as the pace of housing starts nationwide reached the strongest pace in six months. The rate of overall construction rose 2.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million from 1.19 million in June, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was the highest level since February. Most of the gain was from an 8.3 percent acceleration in the construction of multi-family buildings. Construction of single-family houses edged up just 0.3 percent. Washington County mall sold for $20M A Washington County shopping center has been sold to an undisclosed buyer for $20 million. Philadelphia-based real estate investment trust Preit announced the sale of the Washington Crown Center on Tuesday. The mall, about 25 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, has anchor stores including Bon-Ton, Macy's, Gander Mountain and Sears. Preit CEO Joseph Coradino said his company is focused on developing a strong portfolio of assets. Preit also owns Beaver Valley Mall in Monaca, which is for sale. U.S. consumer prices unchanged in July Consumer prices were unchanged in July as a big drop in gasoline and other energy prices kept inflation under control. The Labor Department said Tuesday that the flat reading for overall inflation followed a 0.2 percent gain in June. Energy prices fell by the largest amount in five months. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food, edged up 0.1 percent in July, the smallest increase in four months. The Federal Reserve has an inflation target of 2 percent annual increases. Core inflation has risen 2.2 percent during the past 12 months, but overall inflation still is well below the Fed's target, rising just 0.8 percent in the past 12 months. The Fed has left interest rates unchanged after a single rate hike in December. Airbnb tries concierge role with app for dining, city guides Airbnb Inc. is pressing ahead with plans to expand into new travel services such as restaurant reservations and city tours, transforming the company from a single-minded home-rental service to a multipurpose trip planner. The company is testing a stand-alone mobile app for finding and organizing travel plans, highlighting the importance of the initiative to the company. A test version of the software is called Airbnb Trips, according to an Android app listing on the Google Play Store. The app offers access to personal itineraries with information about upcoming Airbnb rentals, city guidebooks, and dining and happy hour events. A person familiar with the matter said the app's name and features could change before its release. Hedge-fund manager Cohen settles with commodities agency Billionaire hedge-fund manager Steven A. Cohen, who was accused of failing to prevent massive insider trading at his firm, has agreed in a settlement with the government not to engage in any activities overseen by federal commodities regulators until at least Dec. 31, 2017. The settlement, announced Tuesday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, follows on the action brought against Cohen by the Securities and Exchange Commission over insider trading at his firm, formerly called SAC Capital Advisors. In an agreement with the SEC in January, Cohen was barred for two years from managing other people's money. He wasn't fined under the agreement and neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations. The SEC had alleged that Cohen ignored red flags and failed to prevent one of his SAC portfolio managers, Mathew Martoma, from illegally reaping profits. Factory output jumps 0.5 percent for biggest gain in year U.S. factories cranked out more vehicles, machinery and chemicals in July, lifting production by the most in a year. The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that factory output grew 0.5 percent in July, following a 0.3 percent gain in June. The figures suggest U.S. manufacturing might be turning a corner after struggling to overcome the impact of a stronger dollar, slower overseas growth and falling oil prices. Still, factory output is just 0.2 percent higher than it was a year ago. And even as output ticks up, manufacturers aren't adding many jobs. Overall industrial production, which includes utilities and mining, expanded 0.7 percent. That is the biggest increase since November 2014. Utilities output jumped 2.1 percent as hotter-than-usual weather boosted air conditioning use. Mining activity rose 0.7 percent, its third consecutive gain.

Now it's the No. 1 form of electronic correspondence in the U.S.  But as traditional e-mail falls out of favor with a growing sliver of the population, Google has struggled to release newer messaging tools that resonate widely.  Now Google is trying again with a new video chat application called Duo. The app works with mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system and Apple Inc.’s iOS. It runs on Wi-Fi and cellular networks, automatically switching between different types and speeds of connection and adjusting video quality. Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call friends, family and other people already stored on smartphone contact lists. The company’s existing video calling and messaging app, Hangouts, requires a Google account which limited adoption, especially in emerging markets. Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp and Messenger, Skype -- now owned by Microsoft Corp. --  and Apple's FaceTime used phone numbers to grow faster. A confusing array of communication options has held Google back. It has two e-mail services -- Gmail, which is the top e-mail service in the U.S. based on unique visitors, according to ComScore, and Inbox; three text offerings, Hangouts, Messenger and the upcoming Allo; and now two video chat services, Duo and Hangouts (which offers texting and video calls). This scattershot approach, and Google’s late start, is becoming more costly for the Alphabet Inc. division as messaging evolves from a simple way to communicate quickly into one of the next big technology platforms supporting digital commerce, advertising and new services powered by artificial-intelligence. "Google missed it because of the requirement that you needed a Google ID to communicate with others," said Ankit Jain, a former Googler and executive at SimilarWeb Inc., which measures website and mobile app usage. Hangouts ranked 84th among Android apps in the U.S. in July, based on installs and usage, according to SimilarWeb. That lagged Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Snapchat. Nick Fox, a 13-year Google veteran, was tasked by Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai 18 months ago with fixing the sprawl. Soon after, his new team formulated a strategy and started building Duo and Allo. "Google sees communication as this essential human need, whether that’s through text, a picture, calling someone or doing a video call." Fox said in a recent interview. This insight is a decade old and has guided Facebook’s strategy since its creation in 2004. Asian companies, like Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and Line, have grown into tech powerhouses by connecting people through communication apps and offering related services on top of their networks. Skype, founded in 2003, became a leading video chat app on a similar foundation. So how is Fox going to catch up? Job number one is clearing up the bloated smorgasbord of Google communications services. Hangouts will be a workplace service, offering group video conferencing mostly via desktop computers and office laptops, Fox said. It will be integrated more with Google’s work software, such as Docs, Sheets and Slides, which will be easier to share. Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering. Allo, a messaging service coming out later this year, will also target consumers, Fox said. Google’s Messenger is a basic text system, part of a group of services provided to wireless carriers that work closely with Android. The second tactic: Bringing what Fox says is better technology to the new services to catch up with rivals.  Duo constantly performs "bandwidth estimation" to understand how much video can be delivered. If Wi-Fi weakens, it switches to a phone’s cellular network. If a cellular signal drops as low as 2G, Duo will automatically cut video and maintain audio. Allo will use Google’s expertise in AI to automatically understand texts and provide useful suggestions. Google will also let third-party developers create chatbots that will interact with Allo users through messages. That’s already being tried by other companies such as Facebook and Microsoft, but Google has been working hard on AI for about a decade, so it may be more advanced. "First build a great product," Fox said, repeating a common Google mantra. "Once you get people to love it, they will share it with friends and co-workers and it grows."  Google was late in other technology and caught up, Fox noted. Gmail started in 2004, more than six years after Yahoo Mail, but Google’s offer of mountains of free storage won over hundreds of millions of users. Google’s Chrome emerged in 2008 -- over a decade after Microsoft’s Internet Explorer -- and is now the most popular web browser partly because of speed and frequent updates. Better technology may not be enough to catch up, Jain said. WhatsApp and Snapchat offered something useful enough to persuade many people to switch away from their existing communication service where all their friends already were. Duo’s promise of video calling for everyone on Android and iOS is something that Hangouts already offers, but that didn’t move the needle enough, he noted. "It’s worth another shot, but having better tech can’t be the only thing," Jain said. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Google Duo is billed as a simple video-calling app that brings two callers face-to-face, using the front-facing cameras of their smartphones or tablets, over a cellular or Wi-Fi network. Unlike Apple’s FaceTime, Google Duo is available to users of several operating systems — namely Android and iOS for the time being. Presented as the fastest and most easy-to-use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) tool, Duo is lined up as a direct rival to FaceTime (for iOS) and even Skype (available for Android and iOS) for making video calls. Although relatively limited in functionality, the app does come with a new and amusing feature called “Knock Knock,” which shows the person calling live onscreen before you even answer the call. Google Duo was released yesterday in the US and will roll out to other regions imminently. Duo will soon be followed by Allo, an intelligent instant messaging app expected to land with Android Nougat (7.0) this autumn. Google Duo and Allo are due to replace Hangouts, which, in the future, should be more geared towards business users. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week How Apple lost China to two unknown local smartphone makers Facebook reportedly built a censorship tool for China (VIDEO) Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Twitter boss briefly suspended from his own network Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Three Star Wars drones to land before Christmas (VIDEO) Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election Zuckerberg says he’ll take steps to solve Facebook fake news Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles WhatsApp joins rivals from Snapchat to WeChat in video calls Jury orders Apple to pay more than US$625m Snapchat could soon feature voice and video calls Text me?

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo News: The 5 Best Android Calendar Apps to Replace Your Stock One Dallas Thomas 3 weeks ago The 5 Best Android Calendar Apps to Replace Your Stock One Whether you use Google Calendar, Exchange, iCloud, or any other service, you need a good Android calendar app to keep you organized on the go. For many folks, the obvious answer was always Sunrise Calendar, but Microsoft purchased the company behind this awesome app in a classic acqui-hire move, and now, Sunrise has officially been shut down. Microsoft has baked some of Sunrise's features into their Outlook app, but it's still a very email-oriented app above all else. So if you've been looking for a proper Sunrise replacement, we went ahead and did the legwork for you, and compiled a list of the most unique, functional, and downright gorgeous calendar apps out there. Don't Miss: 5 Apps That Let You Make Calls Without Giving Out Your Real Number WAVE Calendar If you're looking for a Sunrise replacement, WAVE Calendar is definitely one of your best options. Its default month and agenda view is almost identical to Sunrise, and many additional calendars can be downloaded with ease, including sports schedules for every major league. But what really seals the deal here is that WAVE is completely free, yet still doesn't display any ads. Install WAVE Calendar for free from the Google Play Store WAVE Quick Facts: Supported services: Google, Exchange, Yahoo, Outlook, Facebook, and more Downloadable calendars: Sports, finance, holidays, religion, and more To-do lists: Yes Widgets: 3 (day, month, agenda) Available for iOS: Yes OneView Calendar Out of all the calendar apps we've come across, OneView has the most distinctive layout. It's a schedule view that keys in on the current month by default, but you can pinch to zoom in or out if you'd like to focus more on your upcoming agenda for the day, week, or coming months. It's got some pseudo-Material Design elements, too, but the overall look is certainly unique to OneView. Install OneView Calendar for free from the Google Play Store OneView Quick Facts: Supported services: Google, Exchange, Yahoo, Outlook, and more Downloadable calendars: None To-do lists: No Widgets: None Available for iOS: Coming soon SolCalendar Don't Miss: The 5 Best Weather Apps for Android With SolCalendar, widgets are the headlining feature. There are ten different widgets to choose from, but even then, you can customize each layout with different themes and transparency, so the possibilities are almost endless. The app itself is no slouch, either—today's weather is integrated into each of the calendar views, and you can even create to-do lists to help keep yourself organized, which can be synced with Google Tasks. Install SolCalendar for free from the Google Play Store SolCalendar Quick Facts: Supported services: iCloud, Google, Exchange, Yahoo, Outlook, and more Downloadable calendars: None To-do lists: Yes Widgets: 10 (day, week, month, agenda) Available for iOS: No DigiCal If you like to have a lot of customization options with your calendar, DigiCal would be a great choice, as it has an expansive settings menu that lets you change the app's behavior and tweak almost any aspect of the interface. But the default settings are more than capable as-is, so if you'd rather not futz around, you can simply sync your calendar, then enjoy features like integrated weather forecasts and a robust set of widgets. Install DigiCal for free from the Google Play Store DigiCal Quick Facts: Supported services: Google, Exchange, Yahoo, Outlook, and more Downloadable calendars: Sports, holidays, religion, TV schedules, and more To-do lists: Yes Widgets: 4 (day, month, agenda) Available for iOS: No Today Calendar Don't Miss: The 12 Best Android Widgets for Getting Things Done As one of the first calendar apps to sport full Material Design, Today Calendar definitely has some of the classiest looks of any calendar app. You get a split month and agenda view by default, but this can be changed to focus on the day, week, month, or just your upcoming agenda. The main accent colors in any of these views can be changed rather easily, plus you've got a solid selection of widgets to match. Install Today Calendar for free from the Google Play Store Today Calendar Quick Facts: Supported services: Google, Exchange, Yahoo, Outlook, more Downloadable calendars: None To-do lists: No Widgets: 5 (agenda, month, split view) Available for iOS: No Of course, this isn't an exhaustive list, as there are plenty of great Android calendar apps out there. Plus, we left the official Google Calendar app off the list since it comes pre-installed on most Android devices, but that's another great choice. So if you personally prefer a calendar app that we didn't mention here, feel free to share a link in the comment section below.

Photo / Getty Images Google nailed email with the 2004 introduction of Gmail. Now it's the No. 1 form of electronic correspondence in the US. But as traditional email falls out of favour with a growing sliver of the population, Google has struggled to make its messaging tools relevant or introduce new ones that resonate with younger users. Now Google is trying again with a new video chat application called Duo. The app works with mobile devices running Google's Android operating system and Apple's iOS. It runs on Wi-Fi and cellular networks, automatically switching between different types and speeds of connection and adjusting video quality. Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call friends, family and other people already stored on smartphone contact lists. The company's existing video calling and messaging app, Hangouts, requires a Google account which limited adoption, especially in emerging markets. Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger, Skype -- now owned by Microsoft -- and Apple's FaceTime used phone numbers to grow faster. A confusing array of communication options has held Google back. It has two e-mail services -- Gmail, which is the top e-mail service in the US based on unique visitors, according to ComScore, and Inbox; three text offerings, Hangouts, Messenger and the upcoming Allo; and now two video chat services, Duo and Hangouts (which offers texting and video calls). This scattershot approach, and Google's late start, is becoming more costly for the Alphabet division as messaging evolves from a simple way to communicate quickly into one of the next big technology platforms supporting digital commerce, advertising and new services powered by artificial-intelligence.

Related Content Spark pays full-time workers $40k minimum What it's really like to work at Microsoft John Drinnan: From enemies to best of friends "Google missed it because of the requirement that you needed a Google ID to communicate with others," said Ankit Jain, a former Googler and executive at SimilarWeb, which measures website and mobile app usage.

Duo will also compete with Microsoft’s video-calling app Skype, Facebook’s Messenger and even its own Hangout app. Duo comes with a unique feature called Knock Knock, which lets a person to see live video of a caller before answering. Google said video calls would work even on slower networks by “gracefully” reducing the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. “For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call,” Justin Uberti, principal software engineer, wrote in a blog post. Google, owned by Alphabet, said the app would be live worldwide in the next few days. Meanwhile, Apple plans to boost its investment in China, one of its most important but increasingly difficult markets, and build its first Asia-Pacific research and development centre in the country, chief executive Tim Cook said yesterday. Demand for Apple’s phones has plummeted in China, and the government maintains a wary attitude towards foreign technology. This is at least the CEO’s second trip to the country in four months. Apple’s new research and development centre will be built by the end of the year, Mr Cook told vice premier Zhang Gaoli, one of China’s most senior officials, according to the official Chinese state broadcaster. The pledge comes after the head of China’s technology regulator in May told Mr Cook he hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research and development and stressed information security. Sales in greater China, once touted as Apple’s next growth engine, fell by a third in its most recent quarterly results, after having more than doubled a year earlier.

However, by the second half, the US adjusted and the gap in talent proved to be too much. This US team had a second gear when things became dicey, Japan did not. This game was not the cakewalk that the 110-64 final score would suggest it was, but by the end the US team clearly showed why they’re the heavy favorites. And that will do it for our live coverage of USA women’s basketball, but the Guardian will continue to have literal around-the-clock coverage of the Olympics until the closing ceremonies.

Go Team USA/Uconn!! ARH Thanks. This has been a lot of fun so far. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.35pm EDT 18:35 The question is: how could Japan pull off an upset here. Well, it’s partly to keep up the same level of intensity while also continuing to keep the US away from the free throw line. And then continue to have the same success from beyond the three point line. In other words: there’s a way to do it. But it’s a lot to ask a team. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.31pm EDT 18:31 Hey Swin Cash!

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.28pm EDT 18:28 Halftime thoughts A lot more entertaining first half than what I was expecting. I would normally say that the US should probably put some distance between them and Japan fairly quickly in the third but I’m not entirely sure that Japan’s going to go away that easily. I still don’t see the US losing here, but it’s now officially on the table.

Not a lot of free throw shooting this game, which is probably not good for the US but I’m not complaining as a viewer.

After that, Spain beat Turkey 64-62. I wouldn’t expect our game’s final score to be this close. After our game, Canada will face off against France around 9:15pm EST. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.58pm EDT 16:58 Preamble This sounds like it should be hyperbole, but it’s just the truth: the US women’s team might be one of the greatest collections of basketball talent ever. Obviously, this statement will end up looking foolish should they somehow fail to win the gold but, unlike their peers on the men’s team, they have yet to show any signs of vulnerability. While both teams are currently undefeated heading into the knockout rounds, the men’s team has played three straight closer-than-expected games, while the women’s team has been completely demolishing their competition. Their point differential during the preliminaries has been a ridiculous +204 while the men’s team has put up a comparatively underwhelming +117 after winning their games against Serbia and France by only three points. So, it’s not entirely certain that there’s a team out there that could possibly knock the US women out of this tournament. It’s definitely difficult to imagine this Japanese team pulling off the shocking upset. Japan has only familiar to US fans, Ramu Tokashiki, who plays for the Seattle Storm, where she received an All-Rookie nod in her debut season. Japan went 3-2 during the preliminary stage, squeaking into the quarterfinals as the fourth seed in Group A. (Oh, and for comparison their point differential so far in the Olympics has been +8). So it’s a bit of an understatement to say that the US are the favorites in this matchup, but, well, there’s a reason they play the games. That’s the beauty of these Olympics: there’s a 80% chance we’ll witness a dominant performance, a 19% chance we’ll have an entertaining game and a 1% chance of one of the most surprising upsets of the year. In any event, it should be fun. And, as always, we encourage your feedback. We’ll post your emails (you can address those to Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com) and tweets (to @HunterFelt) throughout today’s game. Opening tip is scheduled at 5:45pm EST but I’ll be back well before then.

Duo messenger is Google’s take on Apple’s FaceTime and Microsoft’s Skype, and its USP is its simplicity. The app is being rolled out in a phased manner, but at the time of filing this story it isn’t available in India. Google’s Duo is a one-to-one video calling app based on your phone number. In essence, one can simply tap on a person’s face in the contact list that will initiate a one-on-one video call much like how Apple’s FaceTime works.

Google first showed off Duo at its I/O conference in May, promising that the new app would be very simple and focus more on the human element by offering you a live view of the video before answering the call, thanks to the Knock Knock feature. The Knock Knock feature gives you a live video of the caller before you answer. In the launch announcement, Google says that all calls with Duo are end-to-end encrypted. Beyond that, the app is very simple by design, without any additional connections to messaging or other Google services. For a deeper dive, you can check out the obligatory YouTube video with lots of happy people. Duo is available now in the App Store and Google Play Store. Why this matters: Hangouts has long been a mess, offering a buggy and inconsistent experience for video calling and messaging. Duo is the first of Google’s new, well, duo of apps designed to remedy this. Allo is an iMessage-style app that should also launch soon, promising to bring you cross-platform messaging bliss with the smarts of the new Google Assistant.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Now it’s the No. 1 form of electronic correspondence in the US. But as traditional e-mail falls out of favour with a growing sliver of the population, Google has struggled to make its messaging tools relevant or introduce new ones that resonate with younger users. Now Google is trying again with a new video chat application called Duo. The app works with mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system and Apple Inc.’s iOS. It runs on Wi-Fi and cellular networks, automatically switching between different types and speeds of connection and adjusting video quality. Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call friends, family and other people already stored on smartphone contact lists. The company’s existing video calling and messaging app, Hangouts, requires a Google account which limited adoption, especially in emerging markets. Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp and Messenger, Skype—now owned by Microsoft Corp.—and Apple’s FaceTime used phone numbers to grow faster. A confusing array of communication options has held Google back. It has two e-mail services—Gmail, which is the top e-mail service in the US based on unique visitors, according to ComScore, and Inbox; three text offerings, Hangouts, Messenger and the upcoming Allo; and now two video chat services, Duo and Hangouts (which offers texting and video calls). This scattershot approach, and Google’s late start, is becoming more costly for the Alphabet Inc. division as messaging evolves from a simple way to communicate quickly into one of the next big technology platforms supporting digital commerce, advertising and new services powered by artificial-intelligence. “Google missed it because of the requirement that you needed a Google ID to communicate with others,” said Ankit Jain, a former Googler and executive at SimilarWeb Inc., which measures website and mobile app usage. Hangouts ranked 84th among Android apps in the US in July, based on installs and usage, according to SimilarWeb. That lagged Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Snapchat. Nick Fox, a 13-year Google veteran, was tasked by Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai 18 months ago with fixing the sprawl. Soon after, his new team formulated a strategy and started building Duo and Allo. “Google sees communication as this essential human need, whether that’s through text, a picture, calling someone or doing a video call.” Fox said in a recent interview. This insight is a decade old and has guided Facebook’s strategy since its creation in 2004. Asian companies, like Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat and Line, have grown into tech powerhouses by connecting people through communication apps and offering related services on top of their networks. Skype, founded in 2003, became a leading video chat app on a similar foundation. So how is Fox going to catch up? Job number one is clearing up the bloated smorgasbord of Google communications services. Hangouts will be a workplace service, offering group video conferencing mostly via desktop computers and office laptops, Fox said. It will be integrated more with Google’s work software, such as Docs, Sheets and Slides, which will be easier to share. Also Read: Hike becomes a unicorn after raising $175 million from Tencent, Foxconn Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering. Allo, a messaging service coming out later this year, will also target consumers, Fox said. Google’s Messenger is a basic text system, part of a group of services provided to wireless carriers that work closely with Android. The second tactic: Bringing what Fox says is better technology to the new services to catch up with rivals. Duo constantly performs “bandwidth estimation” to understand how much video can be delivered. If Wi-Fi weakens, it switches to a phone’s cellular network. If a cellular signal drops as low as 2G, Duo will automatically cut video and maintain audio. Allo will use Google’s expertise in AI to automatically understand texts and provide useful suggestions. Google will also let third-party developers create chatbots that will interact with Allo users through messages. That’s already being tried by other companies such as Facebook and Microsoft, but Google has been working hard on AI for about a decade, so it may be more advanced. “First build a great product,” Fox said, repeating a common Google mantra. “Once you get people to love it, they will share it with friends and co-workers and it grows.” Google was late in other technology and caught up, Fox noted. Gmail started in 2004, more than six years after Yahoo Mail, but Google’s offer of mountains of free storage won over hundreds of millions of users. Google’s Chrome emerged in 2008—over a decade after Microsoft’s Internet Explorer—and is now the most popular web browser partly because of speed and frequent updates. Beyond tech Better technology may not be enough to catch up, Jain said. WhatsApp and Snapchat offered something useful enough to persuade many people to switch away from their existing communication service where all their friends already were. Duo’s promise of video calling for everyone on Android and iOS is something that Hangouts already offers, but that didn’t move the needle enough, he noted. “It’s worth another shot, but having better tech can’t be the only thing,” Jain said.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Photos brings back rotating video feature in latest update By Ida Torres - August 16, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter One of the things that we’ve loved about Google Photos, which they eventually removed, is now making a comeback in the latest update. People have spotted that the ability to rotate videos on the photo cloud app can now be used again in version 1.25. This is just part of Google’s habit of removing and then bringing back specific features, or you can look at it as experimenting with what works for people or what their users really find necessary or useful (or useless, on the other hand). Rotating still images is pretty much standard for most photo apps and even your device’s built-in photo editor. But not everyone has the ability to rotate their videos at 90 degree intervals, just like you would a photo. That’s why when Google Photos had this feature, we were pretty pleased. There are some videos that you take at certain angles that you’d like to rotate, for one reason or another. So we were baffled when it was suddenly gone. But at least now we have it back. The only difference and problem with this “new” feature is that it is only accessible on a video in your camera folder. So this means you can’t edit or rotate a video that has been uploaded or downloaded. So make sure that you’ve already edited the footage before you upload it to Google Photos and then delete the original copy. It may be a hassle, but it’s still better than nothing. And they may add improvements later on who knows. There seems to be no announcement yet as to the changelog for Google Photos version 1.25. Or it may also be a side-server pitch. Try and see if you already have rotate video back and let us know.

It’s not that different from the other video chatting services, except that it gives users a glimpse at who’s making the call, helping people decide whether to answer or not. Google says it’s calling the feature, “knock, knock”. The new app, originally announced in May, is being released as a free service for phones running on Google’s Android operating system as well as Apple’s iPhones. Calls are encrypted and the video resolution changes depending on the speed of your connection. Like FaceTime on iOS, Duo only requires a person’s phone number to connect. Many other services require both people to have account logins to use the video calling options. Google’s been offering video calling through Hangouts since 2013, but the company’s now tailoring that service for business meetings and it won’t plug into the new video chat service. Duo is being billed as a simpler, more reliable way to see friends and family as you talk to them. The app is rolling out around the world over the next few days. It’s the first of two new mobile apps that Google has planned for the next few months. The US company is also preparing to unveil a new messaging app called Allofeaturing a robotic assistant that will suggest automated responses to texts. That includes commenting on pictures sent by friends, thanks to its use of image recognition algorithms. Google announced a conversation-based tool – Google Assistant – to control smartphones, smartwatches and other devices earlier this year. It can be used to find information, play media and carry out tasks via a chat between the user and the software. The firm also announced a voice-activated device with a built-in speaker called Google Home to deliver the tech to living rooms.

Google Video calling will soon be as simple as dialing a phone number with “Duo,” a simple one-to-one video calling app that only requires users a Google account and Internet connection. The latest of Google’s apps for iOS and Android, Duo promises users with a simplified video calling experience sans the requirements imposed by other social media apps. “Duo is simple from start to finish,” Google said in an official blog post. “To get started, all you need is your phone number and you’ll be able to reach people in your phone’s contacts list. No separate account is required, so you can sign up in just a few steps. From there, you can instantly begin a video call with a single tap.” Google Duo features Another feature that sets Duo apart from other video-calling apps like Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat or Viber is its “Knock Knock” feature. “We designed Duo to feel warm and inviting, focused on just you and the person you’re calling. “To make calls feel more like an invitation rather than an interruption, we created a feature in Duo called Knock Knock which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, giving you a sense of what they’re up to and why they want to chat. Knock Knock makes video calling more spontaneous and welcoming, helping you connect with the person before you even pick up.” Introducing #GoogleDuo: one tap video calling for Android &amp; iOS → https://t.co/WIcurrUBYA pic.twitter.com/UFPvpVn2Cp &mdash; Google (@google) August 16, 2016 Duo also promises users with fast and reliable video connection that works even on slow and erratic Internet connection. “We all know how it feels when a call fails to connect or when video gets choppy. We’ve built Duo to be fast and reliable, so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks. “Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions to keep you connected — when bandwidth is limited, Duo will gracefully reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. “For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call. You can start your call at home, and continue seamlessly even when you head out the door. Google has started the rollout of Duo for Android and iOS Tuesday but the new video-calling app is yet to be available for download worldwide.  WATCH: Meet Google Duo, a new way to video call Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Google challenges ‘Pokemon Go’ with ‘Verne’ Instagram clones Snapchat with ‘Stories’ Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 Adele's 2017 Australian tour details: Ticket prices and schedule 0 Shares 2 ‘The Bold And The Beautiful’ spoilers for Nov. 17: Love rivalries intensify; Katie questions Eric’s relationship with Quinn 0 Shares 3 ‘The Bold And The Beautiful’ spoilers for Nov. 21: Quinn threatens Katie; Steffy and Eric have an emotional talk 0 Shares 4 Breakthrough melanoma blood test developed by Aussie scientists 0 Shares 5 Optus and Huawei completed 5G trial in Australia 0 Shares 6 ‘Outlander’: New behind-the-scenes picture of Sam Heughan 0 Shares 7 ‘Outlander’ Season 3: Behind-the-scenes pictures of print shop 0 Shares 8 'Outlander' Season 3: Leaked pictures from University of Glasgow 0 Shares 9 ‘X Factor Australia’ 2016 grand finals news: Fans wonder whether Robbie Williams would pull another breast-nuzzling stunt in the finale 0 Shares 10 'The Young and the Restless' spoilers for Nov. 21 – 25: Genoa City deals with a marriage proposal, a shocking bombshell and a Thanksgiving celebration 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Apple Pay wins deal with 31 Australian banks, credit unions Domino’s to sell thickshakes and ice cream in cups in July 2017 3rd loss for Johnson & Johnson after St Louis jury awards over $70 million to California woman diagnosed with ovarian cancer Hancock Prospecting says its bid for Kidman cattle business is superior to BBHO’s Oxfam’s ‘Naughty & Nice’ list details big retailers operating in Australia which disclose factory location Woolworths opens its first next generation store in Sydney More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance British woman charged with extramarital sex in Dubai after reporting her gang rape Pregnant Sydney woman burnt by charging iPhone 7 as she slept Chili’s apologises after US veteran’s food taken away by manager on Veterans Day Killer clown stabs woman on leg while at home Aussie teen arrested in Bali over drug claim Hot coffee scalds on groin area 16-year-old passenger of Virgin Australia More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East Cleveland Cavaliers trying to acquire Deron Williams via trade Blake Griffin won't be joining Thunder in free agency next year Returning Matthew Wade promises to make Test spot his own Australians dominate American college football, up for Ray Guy Award Barack Obama roasts Michael Jordan at the White House Lakers nearly drafted Russ Smith over Jordan Clarkson in 2014 More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More 'Dig That Gold' gives 'Pokemon Go' a twist by providing players with tangible rewards Apple iPhone 6s battery replacement program guide in Australia Nokia officially confirms its return to smartphones Black Friday 2016 Australia: Best Xbox One and Xbox 260 deals straight from Microsoft Australia's JB Hi-Fi staff says PS4 Slim is on sale at $299 on Black Friday 2016 Microsoft Surface Book vs Apple MacBook Pro More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Outlander' Season 3: Leaked pictures from University of Glasgow 'Stranger Things' season 2 update: Brett Gelman joins that cast as a disgraced journalist 'Scream Queens' season 2 episode 6 spoilers: Green Meanie’s identity revealed; Nurse Hoffel cooks up revenge in ‘Blood Drive’ ‘X Factor Australia’ 2016 grand finals news: Fans wonder whether Robbie Williams would pull another breast-nuzzling stunt in the finale Adele's Australia tour: Ticketek and Ticketmaster post ticket updates on Twitter ‘Game of Thrones’ Season 7: The Mountain in the mirror More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car NASA's Juno Probe Reaches Jupiter Orbit China Begins Military Exercises In South China Sea Jose Mourinho: 'It's A Job Everyone Wants' Dior Unveils Autumn Creations At Paris Haute Couture Week IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

Bring it back with this extension Ben Schoon - 3 months ago @NexusBen Apps & Updates Chrome/OS View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Google Chrome is constantly changing, sometimes for the good, other times for the bad. Some changes are small, others large, but even the smallest, seemingly meaningless change can make a big difference in how we use the browser. That was the case recently when Google disabled the shortcut to go back in Chrome by pressing the backspace key. This change was made to help people avoid losing their work online by mistake by pressing the button at the wrong time, but thanks to plenty of user feedback, Google has brought back that functionality. To make this completely optional, Chrome will still disable this feature by default and rather allow users to bring it back by installing the “Go Back With Backspace” Chrome extension. You may have noticed that we recently removed the shortcut to go back in Chrome using the Backspace key. This helps save people from accidentally losing their work online, which is never fun. For those who miss it, we hear you loud and clear, and have launched a Chrome Extension to bring it back. After installing this extension through the Chrome Web Store, the functionality will immediately be restored. It works just like it did back before Chrome v52, but there are certain limitations due to the nature of how Chrome handles extension. For example, certain pages such as the settings menu won’t work with this extension. This is a pretty simple change, but it’s great to see Google listening to user feedback and doing something about it. If you miss this shortcut just like I did, then head over to the Chrome Web Store and check it out for yourself!

The latest of Google’s apps for iOS and Android, Duo promises users with a simplified video calling experience sans the requirements imposed by other social media apps. “Duo is simple from start to finish,” Google said in an official blog post. “To get started, all you need is your phone number and you’ll be able to reach people in your phone’s contacts list. No separate account is required, so you can sign up in just a few steps. From there, you can instantly begin a video call with a single tap.” Google Duo features Another feature that sets Duo apart from other video-calling apps like Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat or Viber is its “Knock Knock” feature. “We designed Duo to feel warm and inviting, focused on just you and the person you’re calling. “To make calls feel more like an invitation rather than an interruption, we created a feature in Duo called Knock Knock which lets you see live video of your caller before you answer, giving you a sense of what they’re up to and why they want to chat. Knock Knock makes video calling more spontaneous and welcoming, helping you connect with the person before you even pick up.” Introducing #GoogleDuo: one tap video calling for Android &amp; iOS → https://t.co/WIcurrUBYA pic.twitter.com/UFPvpVn2Cp &mdash; Google (@google) August 16, 2016 Duo also promises users with fast and reliable video connection that works even on slow and erratic Internet connection. “We all know how it feels when a call fails to connect or when video gets choppy. We’ve built Duo to be fast and reliable, so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks. “Call quality adjusts to changing network conditions to keep you connected — when bandwidth is limited, Duo will gracefully reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. “For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call. You can start your call at home, and continue seamlessly even when you head out the door. Google has started the rollout of Duo for Android and iOS Tuesday but the new video-calling app is yet to be available for download worldwide.  WATCH: Meet Google Duo, a new way to video call Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Google challenges ‘Pokemon Go’ with ‘Verne’ Instagram clones Snapchat with ‘Stories’ Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 Adele's 2017 Australian tour details: Ticket prices and schedule 0 Shares 2 ‘The Bold And The Beautiful’ spoilers for Nov. 17: Love rivalries intensify; Katie questions Eric’s relationship with Quinn 0 Shares 3 ‘The Bold And The Beautiful’ spoilers for Nov. 21: Quinn threatens Katie; Steffy and Eric have an emotional talk 0 Shares 4 Breakthrough melanoma blood test developed by Aussie scientists 0 Shares 5 Optus and Huawei completed 5G trial in Australia 0 Shares 6 ‘Outlander’: New behind-the-scenes picture of Sam Heughan 0 Shares 7 ‘Outlander’ Season 3: Behind-the-scenes pictures of print shop 0 Shares 8 'Outlander' Season 3: Leaked pictures from University of Glasgow 0 Shares 9 ‘X Factor Australia’ 2016 grand finals news: Fans wonder whether Robbie Williams would pull another breast-nuzzling stunt in the finale 0 Shares 10 'The Young and the Restless' spoilers for Nov. 21 – 25: Genoa City deals with a marriage proposal, a shocking bombshell and a Thanksgiving celebration 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Apple Pay wins deal with 31 Australian banks, credit unions Domino’s to sell thickshakes and ice cream in cups in July 2017 3rd loss for Johnson & Johnson after St Louis jury awards over $70 million to California woman diagnosed with ovarian cancer Hancock Prospecting says its bid for Kidman cattle business is superior to BBHO’s Oxfam’s ‘Naughty & Nice’ list details big retailers operating in Australia which disclose factory location Woolworths opens its first next generation store in Sydney More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance British woman charged with extramarital sex in Dubai after reporting her gang rape Pregnant Sydney woman burnt by charging iPhone 7 as she slept Chili’s apologises after US veteran’s food taken away by manager on Veterans Day Killer clown stabs woman on leg while at home Aussie teen arrested in Bali over drug claim Hot coffee scalds on groin area 16-year-old passenger of Virgin Australia More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East Cleveland Cavaliers trying to acquire Deron Williams via trade Blake Griffin won't be joining Thunder in free agency next year Returning Matthew Wade promises to make Test spot his own Australians dominate American college football, up for Ray Guy Award Barack Obama roasts Michael Jordan at the White House Lakers nearly drafted Russ Smith over Jordan Clarkson in 2014 More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More 'Dig That Gold' gives 'Pokemon Go' a twist by providing players with tangible rewards Apple iPhone 6s battery replacement program guide in Australia Nokia officially confirms its return to smartphones Black Friday 2016 Australia: Best Xbox One and Xbox 260 deals straight from Microsoft Australia's JB Hi-Fi staff says PS4 Slim is on sale at $299 on Black Friday 2016 Microsoft Surface Book vs Apple MacBook Pro More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Outlander' Season 3: Leaked pictures from University of Glasgow 'Stranger Things' season 2 update: Brett Gelman joins that cast as a disgraced journalist 'Scream Queens' season 2 episode 6 spoilers: Green Meanie’s identity revealed; Nurse Hoffel cooks up revenge in ‘Blood Drive’ ‘X Factor Australia’ 2016 grand finals news: Fans wonder whether Robbie Williams would pull another breast-nuzzling stunt in the finale Adele's Australia tour: Ticketek and Ticketmaster post ticket updates on Twitter ‘Game of Thrones’ Season 7: The Mountain in the mirror More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car NASA's Juno Probe Reaches Jupiter Orbit China Begins Military Exercises In South China Sea Jose Mourinho: 'It's A Job Everyone Wants' Dior Unveils Autumn Creations At Paris Haute Couture Week IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

The DA appealed for anyone seeing a man with fresh injuries of that nature earlier this week to call the State Police tip line. Law enforcement has now narrowed the scope of their inquiries to between 1pm and 3pm on Sunday afternoon. They were previously looking at the hours between 1pm and 4pm. They have also appealed for anybody who may have seen a vehicle traveling along, or parked on, Brooks Station Road during that time to come forward. Last Tuesday, her father issued a heartfelt plea asking people to pray for justice for his daughter and that that perpetrator of this horrendous crime be caught. Speaking to Daily Mail Online from his home in Leominster, where Vanessa was raised, John Marcotte said: 'How can anything ever be all right again when your only child has been horribly murdered?' He said: 'I'd ask people to pray that whoever did this is caught. She was the best kid in the world. Graduated top of her class.'  Barely 24 hours earlier her father saw her for what would be the last time. He recalled: 'I was with her. We went out to eat at the Chop House on Saturday night. After that, the next day, she was dead.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 1.1k shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob REVEALED: Number of Hamilton stars haven't voted in YEARS...

Google Duo, a 1-to-1 video calling app, launched this week to as fast and reliable answer to Apple's FaceTime that works on both iOS and Android. A successful run for Duo, along with messaging app Allo, could mean that users never leave the Google ecosystem that's already popular for email, calendars, and master sign-ins, said Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners. It comes as video and text messaging apps, like Google's new Allo and Duo, increasingly play the role of the one-stop shop that was once the job of the operating system, Wolff told CNBC's "Closing Bell" on Tuesday. Google originally announced the app at its developer conference earlier this year, where the artificially intelligent connections between the new apps was the highlight of the event. "Google's making sure they don't get left behind in a world dominated by the WhatsApp, and the Snapchat, and the FaceTimes and the Apples, who are basically their major competitors," Wolff said. Despite the competition, Wolff said it's dangerous to count out Google too soon. Google's apps are among the most popular across both iOS and Android operating systems, Wolff said. "With ... 85-plus percent market share in the developing market where new users are just coming on, they have a pretty good chance of being the first app you use for a couple of tens of millions of people in the next six months," Wolff said, noting that Duo does well in low-bandwidth environments that are common in some developing markets. "That will be the real test if they can have legs and run with this."

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Wolverton: Google’s new video chat app aims for Apple simplicity By Troy Wolverton / August 16, 2016 at 4:07 PM Six years after Apple launched its video calling service, Google finally has an answer for FaceTime. On Tuesday, the search giant released Duo, its new video calling app. Google designed Duo to be like FaceTime — easy to use. As with Apple’s app, users can simply tap on a friend’s name from their address book and connect. “Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience,” Justin Uberti, a principal software engineer, wrote on Google’s company blog site. “Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are.” Duo has one big advantage over FaceTime — it allow Android users to place video calls to iPhone owners and vice versa. FaceTime only works on Apple devices. Google also added a cool feature not present in FaceTime to Duo. Dubbed Knock Knock, it offers a kind of preview of the video call. Knock Knock allows the recipient of a call to see a live view of the person placing the call to get a sense not only of who is calling but why. And Duo has a simpler initial view than FaceTime. Where FaceTime’s home screen offers a list of contacts users have recently called, Duo show users a view of themselves and a big “video call” button. If users tap on that button, they’ll see a list of friends who they can call on the app. If they’ve placed calls recently, they’ll also see thumbnail pictures of the friends they’ve contacted on the homescreen. Those pictures act as buttons that allow them to make a quick follow-up video call. But in general, the app works much like FaceTime. Like Apple’s app, it’s only used for calling; users can’t send text messages through it. As with FaceTime interactions, Duo encrypts calls made through it, so users don’t have to worry about someone spying on their conversations. And as with FaceTime, Duo automatically identifies people in users’ address books who can be reached through the app. On Tuesday, I did a quick test of Duo, which Google announced in May at its annual developer conference. It worked mostly as advertised. My wife was able to easily place a call from her iPhone to mine using the app. I was able to return her call quickly by simply tapping on a thumbnail picture button on the Duo home screen. The video was generally smooth, although there was a hiccup in it. The app is supposed to be able to keep a video call going even if your phone switches from a WiFi to a cellular network. But while talking with my daughter, the video of me cut out when I turned off my WiFi radio. I was able to see her, but she could only hear me. My video resumed when I turned my WiFi radio back on. Google is no stranger to video calling. Users of Google Talk could place video calls on their PCs eight years ago. Google Hangouts, which the company launched three years ago, allows users to connect on PCs and mobile devices and can be used for video conferences involving multiple people. And users of Google’s Android operating system have numerous choices for video calling apps, including Skype, Facebook Messenger, and WeChat. Cell providers Verizon and T-Mobile also offer video calling features for Android phones. But until now, Android users haven’t had something as easy and ubiquitous to use for video chats as FaceTime. While Hangouts comes pre-installed on most devices, it’s a much more complicated app that can be difficult to use. With Skype, Facebook and other apps, users can typically only place video calls to people who are using the same app. And in some cases users have to know a person’s often idiosyncratic log-on name to connect. And the cell phone video services generally allow users to place video calls only to other users who have certain phones that are connected to the same cellular network. While Duo may be aimed at FaceTime, I’m not convinced it’s going to convince iPhone users to switch to Android. But if it gets enough of a following, it could make it easier for iPhone users to at least consider making the move. Still, FaceTime, which debuted with Apple’s iPhone 4 back in 2010, retains some advantages over Duo. Apple offers it for Mac computers, while Duo isn’t available for the Mac or Windows PC’s. FaceTime allows users to place audio-only calls, while Duo is focused on video ones. And FaceTime users can connect to people even if they don’t know their phone number; FaceTime also recognizes their email address. Photo: Google Duo.

On Tuesday, Google released Duo, its new video chatting application for Android and iOS devices. The app is meant to compete with Apple's FaceTime and Facebook's Messenger. It will soon be joined by Allo, a dedicated texting app with a splash of artificial intelligence. Google already has a handful of messaging apps, and you might be wondering what will become of its mainstay, Google Hangouts. It turns out that the app is primed to live on as an enterprise communications tool. Google Hangouts isn't going anywhere, according to Nick Fox, Google's vice president for communications. The app, which is available on mobile and desktop machines, will "increasingly focus" on the enterprise. (Image: zdravkovic/iStockphoto) "Because Hangouts is built on a Google account, because it's deeply integrated with Google apps, the Apps suite, Gmail, Calendar and so on, it's seen much more success in the enterprise," said Fox in an interview with Engadget. "It will increasingly focus on that kind of group collaboration enterprise productivity space." Hangouts, which will continue to be available to mobile devices, works best from the desktop. It functions seamlessly in the browser for one-on-one and group video chats. It's often used by Google itself within the realm of Google+ for community announcements. But Hangouts tried to be too much, a killer messaging app that did it all: texting, IM, and video. Google has stripped the texting function from Hangouts on mobile devices, but has left the IM and video chatting functionality intact. [Read more about unified communications at a crossroad.] "In some ways it's a return to the roots of Hangouts," said Fox to The Verge, "where it was more of a desktop legacy." The renewed focus could be a good thing. "We do think it's important when we think about these apps to have a target use case or target persona in mind." As a consumer app, Hangouts competed with myriad offerings from Apple, Facebook, WhatsApp, and others. As an enterprise app, Hangouts will go head-to-head with Skype, Slack, Yammer, and Convo. Given Hangouts' lack of focus for so long, it will be curious to see how Google shapes the app with the enterprise in mind. As for Allo and Duo, the new mobile apps will be focused purely on mobile devices, with no corresponding desktop component. Google said it designed Allo and Duo to do one thing really well, rather than a bunch of things. Duo is available today, Aug. 16, for Android and iOS devices. Allo is expected to follow shortly.

The app, called Duo, represents Google’s response to other popular video calling options, including Apple’s FaceTime, Microsoft’s Skype and Facebook’s Messenger app. Duo isn’t much different from the other video chatting services, except that it gives a glimpse at who is making the call, helping the recipient decide whether to answer. Google calls this feature “Knock, knock.” The app, announced in May, was released Tuesday as a free service for phones running on Google’s Android operating system as well as for Apple’s iPhones.

Many other services require both participants to have account log-ins to use their video calling options. Google has been offering video calling through its Hangout feature for several years, but the Internet company is now tailoring that service for business meetings. Duo is being billed as a simpler, more reliable way to see friends and family as you talk to them. It is the first of two new mobile apps that Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., has planned for this summer. The Mountain View company also is preparing to unveil a new messaging app called Allo featuring a robotic assistant that will suggest automated responses to texts.

GOOGL owned online search engine giant Google is scheduled to unveil its new video calling app, Google Duo today that has been developed exclusively for mobile phones running on Android or iOS operating platforms. The new app will be free to use and will compete with other video calling applications such as Microsoft Corporation’s MSFT Skype, Apple Inc.’s AAPL FaceTime and the Messenger app from Facebook.   ALPHABET INC-A Price ALPHABET INC-A Price | ALPHABET INC-A Quote What Sets Google Duo Apart? Knock Knock: The one differentiating factor that sets Google Duo apart from all the other video calling apps is that it has a feature called “Knock, knock” that lets the recipient have a glimpse of the person making the call even before picking it up. However, this feature doesn’t work on an iPhone because Apple doesn’t allow access to the lock-screen and one has to manually unlock the phone before taking the call. Simplicity: Duo has been created keeping ease of use and simplicity in mind. Therefore, it doesn’t require any account logins from its users to use its features. Just like FaceTime, it requires just a phone number to make a video call. Automatic Network Switching: The app is compatible with both Wi-Fi as well as cellular networks and switches seamlessly from one network to the other based on the best signal strength. Unbroken Communication: If the Wi-Fi network is weak, Duo will sense it and seamlessly switch to the phone’s cellular network. In the event, the cellular signal is low such as a 2G network, Duo will switch from video to audio automatically without cutting off the communication. What’s Next? Apart from Duo, Google is planning to launch its other new mobile app called Allo this summer. This app will make use of a robotic assistant that will suggest responses to text messages automatically. Our Take We note that Hangouts, Google’s already existing texting and video calling app, requires the users to create a Google account first. This proves to be an entry barrier for many users in the emerging markets. With the Duo requiring none of those formalities and some additional smart features such as Knock Knock, this app to gain popularity in the coming years. Moreover, while Hangouts will continue to address the requirements of an enterprise with its group video calling features, Duo is just a simple video calling app designed to meet day-to-day requirements of consumers.   Zacks Rank At present, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Privacy lawsuit over Gmail will move forward New plaintiffs hope to push ahead with a class of people who never used Gmail. by Joe Mullin - Aug 16, 2016 11:10 pm UTC Login to bookmark 113 cinefil_ Thanks to a judge's order, Google must face another proposed class-action lawsuit over its scanning of Gmail. The issue is a lingering headache for the search giant, which has faced allegations for years now that scanning Gmail in order to create personalized ads violates US wiretapping laws. In a 38-page order (PDF), US District Judge Lucy Koh rejected Google's argument that the scanning takes place within the "ordinary course of business." "Not every practice that is routine or legitimate will fall within the scope of the 'ordinary course of business'," Judge Koh wrote. Koh noted that while Google has to scan for other reasons, like virus and spam prevention, the company didn't have to scan for advertising purposes. She noted that in April 2014, Google "ceased intercepting, scanning, and analyzing, for advertising purposes, the contents of emails transmitted via Google Apps for Education." According to Koh, that shows that Google is able to provide Gmail, at least to some users, without scanning email for ad purposes. The order was published on Friday and first reported earlier today by Courthouse News. The ruling means that Google won't be able to get the lawsuit, which was filed in September, thrown out at an early stage. However, the plaintiffs are a long way from seeing a payday. Google will likely fight hard to defend the way it has long run its Gmail service. The plaintiffs still have yet to pass key hurdles, including forming a class, which proved impossible in an earlier lawsuit. Koh's order reviews the history of those earlier privacy cases, the first of which was filed in 2010. They were filed in various districts and ultimately consolidated in Koh's court as In re Google Inc. Gmail Litigation. While Google wasn't able to get that suit thrown out either, the individual plaintiffs all dismissed their cases with prejudice after they failed to form a class. In that case, Koh ruled that the question of whether the plaintiffs had provided consent to scan their Gmail needed "individualized inquiries" and couldn't be addressed as a class action. In the case Koh ruled on Friday, Matera v. Google, the plaintiffs are seeking to represent only users who do not use Gmail and have never had a Gmail account, but have still had the content of their emails scanned because they interacted with Gmail users. The plaintiffs in Matera say the scanning violates both the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California state privacy laws.

CHEN Duo, Google's video-calling app, is an alternative to Apple's FaceTime Aug. 16: Google and Apple have battled each other for years for primacy over mobile users. Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple's apps. Today, Google underscored that strategy with the release of its latest mobile app: Duo, a video-calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple's FaceTime. The app fits squarely into Google's playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple's proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones. Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizeably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation. "You shouldn't have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are," Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. "It's no wonder that nearly half of US adults never make video calls on mobile." All this feeds into Google's strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google's apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google's core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple. Nick Fox, Google's head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo's appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible. "Our view is video calling should work for everybody," he said. "If you can only call half the people you know, that's very limiting." Apple does not profess to be worried by Google's moves. When the iPhone maker reported falling sales last month, Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, repeatedly highlighted that the rate at which people were switching from Android-based devices to iPhones was the highest the company had seen. "Our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine-month period," Cook said in the call. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Cook's comments. I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable. First, a little context about Duo and where it fits into the universe of Google apps. The Silicon Valley company announced in May at its annual developer conference that Duo would be coming. The app is solely dedicated to video chats between two people, the company said, to make video calling simpler to access. This is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact. Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers.

STOCKFISCHTampa Bay Times Tuesday, August 16, 2016 9:47pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged ZACK WITTMAN | Times Mayor Bob Buckhorn and Google’s regional expansion lead, Brien Bell, spoke with students from the University of Tampa Business school in October after they announced Google Fiber was coming to the city. Those plans are now on hold. ﻿ TAMPA — Google Fiber's decision to target Tampa as a city to install its coveted high-speed internet service had the town abuzz when it was announced in October. Related News/Archive Google Express delivery service launches in Florida and Tampa Bay today 4 Weeks Ago Faulty router causing internet service disruptions for South Tampa Frontier customers 6 Months Ago Bright House customers: You now belong to Spectrum for cable TV, phone and Internet service 1 Week Ago Mayor Bob Buckhorn and local economic development officials hailed the gigabit-per-second offering, roughly 30 times faster than the U.S. average, as potentially boosting the area's attractiveness to tech companies, entrepreneurs and millennial talent. Now, Google's high-speed internet business is on hold. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Google is reconsidering how to provide the service after initial rollouts proved more expensive and time-consuming than anticipated. "We're continuing to work with city leaders to explore the possibility of bringing Google Fiber to Tampa," Google said in a statement emailed to the Tampa Bay Times. "This means deploying the latest technologies in alignment with our product road map, while understanding local considerations, which takes time." Tampa is among a handful of U.S. cities being considered for the high-speed service. Russell Haupert, the city's chief technology officer, said Google is continuing its engineering review in Tampa and is still in the exploratory phase. The Journal reported that Google is now hoping to use wireless technology to connect homes, rather than cables. The search-engine giant's ultimate decision on whether to provide the ultra-fast service depends on a review of Tampa's permitting regulations and city and state rules that govern utility providers. Cities are also judged on factors like the ability to use existing infrastructure and the topography of an area. Tampa also will have to provide sites for "fiber huts," a shelter for communication equipment on city land. "We're in a holding pattern … but City Council has moved forward with the hut site locations, and we look forward to Google finalizing their exploratory phase in the very near future," said city spokeswoman Ashley Bauman. The council has approved four hut sites and has another up for consideration next month. That approval would fulfill the city's responsibility for providing the sites, Haupert said. Brien Bell, Google's regional expansion lead, came to the University of Tampa in October 2015 to announce that the city was among those chosen for further evaluation from 1,000 applicants for the near light-speed service. He said at the time that Google's interest in Tampa was due to its thriving entrepreneurial sector and because the city is working to bring connectivity to its poorest residents. Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Nashville; Atlanta; and Charlotte, N.C., were the first cities to receive the high-speed service. Tampa is among 12 cities listed by Google as having the potential to receive the service. The super-high speed allows users to stream high-definition video content with little to no delays or buffering; improves online experiences for multiple users and devices connected to a network; eliminates disconnects and frozen images during videoconferencing, and cuts times to upload high-quality images to social networks or the cloud from hours or minutes to seconds.

Ford CEO Mark Fields announced the new goal Tuesday at the company's Silicon Valley campus in Palo Alto, California, sparking rumours it could sell the cars to Uber - which is already testing its self driving systems using the firm's vehicles in Pittsburgh. Scroll down for video  The car will initially be used for commercial ride-hailing or ride-sharing services; sales to consumers will come later, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced. However, he declined to say whether Ford plans to partner with Uber or Lyft in the ride sharing venture, saying 'all options are open and on the table.' 'This is a transformational moment in our industry and it is a transformational moment for our company,' Fields said. Ford's approach to the autonomous car breaks from many other companies, like Mercedes-Benz and Tesla Motors, which plan to gradually add self-driving capability to traditional cars.  Instead, Ford is taking the same approach as Google, which supports moving directly to self-driving cars once the technology is perfected.

Share this article Share 54 shares 'We abandoned the stepping-stone approach of driver-assist technologies and decided we were going to take the full leap,' said Raj Nair, Ford's chief technical officer. Nair says Ford will continue developing driver-assist systems, like automatic emergency braking or lane departure warning.  Ford President and CEO Mark Fields said the move was 'a transformational moment in our industry and it is a transformational moment for our company' as he revealed the firm will have a fully autonomous vehicle ready to provide ride-hailing or ride-sharing services by 2021. But making personal cars more autonomous is dangerous, he said, because Ford hasn't figured out how to make sure drivers stay engaged and ready to take back the wheel when the car encounters an obstacle.  Removing the driver solves that problem. Ford's vehicle will be specifically designed for commercial mobility services, like taxi companies, and will be available in high volumes.  UBER'S SELF DRIVING CAR PLANS  Google's self-driving car may own the streets on the west coast, but Uber has staked its claim on the east - meaning its nearly half million drivers may need to look for other work. The ride-sharing pioneer announced it will begin testing autonomous vehicles around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the coming weeks. The hybrid Ford Fusions, complete with Uber logos, will soon be seen mapping Steel City and testing its self-driving capabilities on public streets. Uber announced that in the next coming weeks it will be testing autonomous vehicles around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in a car that 'should be driven by a superhero'. A hybrid Ford Fusions with the Uber logo will soon be seen mapping data of Steel City and testing its self-driving capabilities on public streets Included in the announcement is a photo of an all black hybrid Ford Fusions that is fully equipped with a variety of sensor, radars and high-resolution cameras. Not only does the San Francisco- based firm believe self-driving cars are the way of the future, it says this technology has the potential 'to save millions of lives and improve quality of life for people around the world'. '1.3 million people die every year in car accidents — 94% of those accidents involve human error,' Uber shared in today's press release. 'In the future we believe this technology will mean less congestion, more affordable and accessible transportation, and far fewer lives lost in car accidents.' Ford says personal ownership of self-driving cars will come later. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company also says it plans to double the staff at its Palo Alto research center by the end of next year to nearly 300 people.  It will buy two more buildings next to its current building in order to expand its campus, Fields said. Ford said it will make several investments and partnerships to speed its development of autonomous vehicles. 'Ford has been developing and testing autonomous vehicles for more than 10 years,' said Nair 'We have a strategic advantage because of our ability to combine the software and sensing technology with the sophisticated engineering necessary to manufacture high-quality vehicles.  'That is what it takes to make autonomous vehicles a reality for millions of people around the world.' THE RACE TO SELF DRIVING CARS: WHO IS UBER'S COMPETITION? One of Google's self driving prototype 'bubble' cars Google's self-driving car In 2009, Google started the self-driving car project.  The testing fleet includes both modified Lexus SUVs and new prototype vehicles that are designed from the ground up to be fully self-driving.  Google's prototype two-seater 'bubble' cars have buttons to begin and end the drive, but no other controls. An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Under the vision unveiled by Google, passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands. Apple's iCar A concept video reveals ideas for a futuristic-looking Apple car, with a wide dashboard display and smart capabilities. The video from ConceptsiPhone boasts that the 2020 vehicle design is 'more than a car,' with connectivity to other Apple devices. The concept by Luca Wrede shows a build that mirrors the minimalist design common to Apple products. A wraparound dashboard screen shows speed, traffic predictions, and answers calls. The vehicle can pull up Apple Maps, Safari, and Siri, which are indicated all on the interactive dashboard. The concept car can even connect to the Apple Watch.  LEECo's LeSEE China's LeEco has unveiled an electric autonomous vehicle that it says will surpass Tesla's Model S in 'all aspects of performance'. Dubbed LeSEE, the sleek pearly white sedan has memory foam seats, Knight Rider-style voice activation, an automatic driving mode and a steering wheel that folds toward the dash when the car is set to autopilot. This futuristic concept car was engineered to be a 'smart', 'connected' and 'automated self-driving car' and the firm hopes it will set the stage for a fleet of autonomous taxis.  Although Uber's competitor Lyft stated it is dabbling in self-driving taxis, it won't have anything to show for it until next year. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'included customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city' General Motors & Lyft's autonomous Taxis General Motors announced a $500 million investment in Lyft earlier this year as a joint effort to develop a fleet of self-driving taxis. Although the idea seemed like a distant dream, the duo has announced plans for a testing program on public roads by 2017. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'include real customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city'.   In addition to the testing program, Lyft is working on a new app that will be used for the autonomous cars.  The app is still a prototype, but will list the option for an autonomous car and there is a GM OnStar assistant to answer questions or report issues while you're en route to your destination.  This year, Ford will triple its autonomous vehicle test fleet to be the largest test fleet of any automaker – bringing the number to about 30 self-driving Fusion Hybrid sedans on the roads in California, Arizona and Michigan, with plans to triple it again next year. Ford was the first automaker to begin testing its vehicles at Mcity, University of Michigan's simulated urban environment, the first automaker to publicly demonstrate autonomous vehicle operation in the snow and the first automaker to test its autonomous research vehicles at night, in complete darkness, as part of LiDAR sensor development. Ford and Chinese search engine company Baidu will each invest $75 million in Velodyne, a company that makes laser sensors that help guide self-driving cars. Velodyne, based in Morgan Hill, California, says it will use the $150 million investment to expand design and production and reduce the cost of its sensors. Laser sensors — called Lidar, which stands for light, detection and ranging — can also be used in conventional vehicles as part of driver assist systems such as automatic emergency braking. Ford also said it has acquired Israel-based computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS for its expertise in artificial intelligence and computer vision.  It has also formed a partnership with Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC, a machine vision company that has developed devices for restoring sight to patients with degenerative eye diseases. UBER'S HIGH RESOLUTION MAPS  Most Uber riders know the pain of watching the tiny car in the app drive around in circles before reaching the blue dot. Now, the ride-sharing giant is teaming up with DigitalGlobe, a vendor of space imagery and geospatial content, 'to help identify and improve pickup and drop-off locations'. Using constellation sensors, the duo will access imagery and location intelligence to create high resolution maps of the area - giving drivers the ability to see exactly where you are. Uber is teaming up with DigitalGlobe, a vendor of space imagery and geospatial content, 'to help identify and improve pickup and drop-off locations'.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

Google set it up to operate around your existing phone number. Unlike Apple’s FaceTime, Google Duo doesn’t care if you’re on iOS or Android. It also has an interesting feature called Knock Knock that allows the callee to see the caller’s live video feed before you answer. The video below demonstrates Knock Knock. Google Duo is “free,” and is available at the App Store and Google Play. [Update: as noted by @grempe on Twitter, Google Duo calls are encrypted end-to-end, an important privacy element to protect users from prying eyes far and wide. – Bryan] Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit 5 Comments Add a comment geoduck August 16, 2016 Might have to check it out. I end up using Skype most of the time because either the person I want to call isn’t on macOS or iOS, or even if the other person is on an Apple device FaceTime just won’t work. Since MS bought Skype I’d like to find another option and maybe this might be it. August 16, 2016 at 6:57 EST PM CudaBoy August 16, 2016 Again, Google leading the way with agnostic simplicity. Poor Apple can never think this way because of it’s own limited “sandbox”. As far as that tired pathetic “you are being data based without your consent” I say get a life. Every call you make on any device is captured by at least one party if not more. Do your research. If you have cable TV, every time you switch channels, every show you watch, all of your viewing habits can easily be traced. If you buy an item in a store via credit card, you are a piece of recorded data. If you think Apple doesn’t have a full bio on YOU who makes purchases from the App store or Apple Store or iTunes then drink some more drone-juice. Google seems to use their data to make better products just as Apple uses your purchasing habits to tailor product to you. August 16, 2016 at 7:27 EST PM furbies August 17, 2016 For the moment at least, it’s not available in the Australian iTunes store August 17, 2016 at 9:30 EST AM Imagestealer August 17, 2016 Also not available in Canada. Kinda strange that these major corporations (both Google and Apple) claim to be global in scope, but can’t seem to see past the U.S. border. August 17, 2016 at 3:01 EST PM Paul Goodwin August 18, 2016 “Every call you make on any device is captured by at least one party if not more.”. FALSE “Poor Apple can never think this way because of it’s own limited “sandbox.” The sandbox is their strength, not their limitation. Google makes some fine products. You just have to understand that they excel in part by being the nosiest company on Earth. August 18, 2016 at 7:45 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Related: new 16GB iPhones shouldn’t be a thing in 2016. Oh, and I specify iPhone owners because the popup window at the heart of the ad’s gag is iOS. Besides, Google knows the best customers use iPhones. Anyhoo, Google has a solution for this problem, the Google Photos app. With this app, your photos and videos are uploaded to Google’s cloud storage (where Google then pilfers them for information it can sell to advertisers). The company left that parenthetical bit out of the ad, but the ad is really good. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit One Comment Add a comment jhorvatic August 9, 2016 Free until they change there plan on you. Why would I want to when there is plenty of room in the iCloud and my information is not pilfered and plastered all over the web. Also if Google is advertising this as free just wait 6 months to a year and they will be asking for a lot of money for you to keep those photos up there. Every free storage cloud that I ever tried would do this so I gave up on all of them and will not take that free bait anymore. So everyone don’t fall for it or you will be sorry.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Google Tuesday released its new Duo video-calling app that seeks to compete with Apple Inc.'s Face Time. Duo allows users to place video calls between Android and iPhone users, effectively increasing the number of people with whom callers may have video conversations, The New York Times reports. Apple makes the iPhone, while Google created the Android operating system. "You shouldn't have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are," Google said in a statement. "It's no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile." With the Duo app, Google seeks to attract iPhone users to Android, the Times reports. Google's apps generally work better on Android devices — in moves that seek to undermine loyalty to Apple and its products. Nick Fox, Google's head of communication products, told the Times that the company's objectives with Duo were to build a quality product and to increase video calling among Android users. However, making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive, Fox added. Duo's attributes are that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible. "Our view is video calling should work for everybody," Fox told the Times. "If you can only call half the people you know, that's very limiting." Apple seems to publicly remain nonplussed by Google's efforts, according to the report, based on CEO Timothy Cook's insistence last month that more people are switching to iPhones from Android devices than ever before. "Our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine-month period," Cook told reporters in an earnings conference call. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment further, the Times reports.

Now it's the No. 1 form of electronic correspondence in the US. But as traditional e-mail falls out of favour with a growing sliver of the population, Google has struggled to make its messaging tools relevant or introduce new ones that resonate with younger users. Now, Google is trying again with a new video chat application called Duo. The app works with mobile devices running Google's Android operating system and Apple's iOS. It runs on Wi-Fi and cellular networks, automatically switching between different types and speeds of connection and adjusting video quality. Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call friends, family and other people already stored on smartphone contact lists. The company's existing video calling and messaging app, Hangouts, requires a Google account, which limited adoption, especially in emerging markets. Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger, Skype - now owned by Microsoft - and Apple's FaceTime used phone numbers to grow faster. A confusing array of communication options has held Google back. It has two e-mail services - Gmail, which is the top e-mail service in the US based on unique visitors, according to ComScore, and Inbox; three text offerings, Hangouts, Messenger and the upcoming Allo; and now two video chat services, Duo and Hangouts (which offers texting and video calls). This scattershot approach, and Google's late start, is becoming more costly for the Alphabet division as messaging evolves from a simple way to communicate quickly into one of the next big technology platforms supporting digital commerce, advertising and new services powered by artificial-intelligence. "Google missed it because of the requirement that you needed a Google ID to communicate with others," said Ankit Jain, a former Google employee and executive at SimilarWeb, which measures website and mobile app usage. Nick Fox, a 13-year Google veteran, was tasked by Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai 18 months ago with fixing the sprawl. Soon after, his new team formulated a strategy and started building Duo and Allo. "Google sees communication as this essential human need, whether that's through text, a picture, calling someone or doing a video call." Fox said in a recent interview. This insight is a decade old and has guided Facebook's strategy since its inception in 2004. Asian companies, like Tencent Holdings's WeChat and Line, have grown into tech powerhouses by connecting people through communication apps and offering related services on top of their networks. ENTER THE DUO The app works with mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system and Apple’s iOS Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call people whose numbers are already stored on smartphone contact lists Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering It constantly performs “bandwidth estimation” to understand how much video can be delivered So how is Fox going to catch up? Job number one is clearing up the bloated smorgasbord of Google communications services. Hangouts will be a workplace service, offering group video conferencing mostly via desktop computers and office laptops, Fox said. It will be integrated more with Google's work software. Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering. Allo, a messaging service coming out later this year, will also target consumers, Fox said. Google's Messenger is a basic text system, part of a group of services provided to wireless carriers that work closely with Android. The second tactic: Bringing what Fox says is better technology to the new services to catch up with rivals. Duo constantly performs "bandwidth estimation" to understand how much video can be delivered. If Wi-Fi weakens, it switches to a phone's cellular network. If a cellular signal drops as low as 2G, Duo will automatically cut video and maintain audio. Allo will use Google's expertise in AI to automatically understand texts and provide useful suggestions. Google will also let third-party developers create chatbots that will interact with Allo users through messages. That's already being tried by other companies such as Facebook and Microsoft. "First build a great product," Fox said, repeating a common Google mantra. "Once you get people to love it, they will share it with friends and co-workers and it grows." Google was late in other technology and caught up, Fox noted. Gmail started in 2004, more than six years after Yahoo Mail, but Google's offer of mountains of free storage won over hundreds of millions of users. Google's Chrome emerged in 2008 - over a decade after Microsoft's Internet Explorer - and is now the most popular web browser partly because of speed and frequent updates. Better technology may not be enough to catch up, Jain said. WhatsApp and Snapchat offered something useful enough to persuade many people to switch away from their existing communication service where all their friends already were. Duo's promise of video calling for everyone on Android and iOS is something that Hangouts already offers, but that didn't move the needle enough, he noted. "It's worth another shot, but having better tech can't be the only thing," Jain said.
