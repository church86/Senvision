 Twitter stock plunges 19% on report that Google and Disney won't make a bid Biz Carson Oct. 6, 2016, 9:52 AM 17,936 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP Images Twitter stock plunged 19% on Thursday morning following reports that neither Google nor Disney will pursue a formal bid for the social network. Sources cited by Recode's Kara Swisher and Kurt Wagner say Google does not plan to make a bid and was not moving forward with any effort to do so. Apple making an acquisition offer was also "unlikely," according to Recode. Twitter has told potential acquirers that it wants to conclude selling negotiations by its third quarter earnings report on October 27, according to sources cited by Reuters. Google was one of the top names on the potential acquirer list, along with Salesforce and Disney. Twitter stock rose early on Wednesday on a Wall Street Journal report that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff considered the company to be an "unpolished jewel." It closed up 5.74% on Wednesday, but took a nosedive in after-hours trading and Thursday morning on the reports that Google was out of the running. Google Despite the talk of the acquisition, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has remained steadfast in his desire to keep it an independent company. According to people familiar with the matter who spoke with Bloomberg's Sarah Frier, Dorsey was opposed to selling Twitter as recently as September 8, when Twitter held a board meeting to discuss the company's future. According to the Bloomberg article, there isn't a consensus within the company as to what should happen in the coming weeks and months. Dorsey wants Twitter to "remain on its current course and work to capitalize on recent product improvements and success in streaming live video," according to Bloomberg.

Because ‘six seconds is more than enough’ Update: DDoS attack on Dyn DNS leaves internet crippled Advertising and Media / Advertising & Marketing / Google Pixel is a physical search bar, according to ad By Staff Reporter on 6 October, 2016 Memeburn Share Google doesn’t do subtle any more. Sure, Google Tricks weren’t exactly marks of elegance, nor are the coy names for its Google Pixel smartphones’ colours. But the company sure knows how to make an advertisement, regardless of how obvious the metaphor is. Published shortly after the Pixels’ launch on 4 October, and airing on US television a few hours after, Google’s new advertisement shows the progression of the company, from a humble internet search engine to the behemoth it is today. Google is evolving to keep its core business fresh, and Google Pixel is evidence of that And the metaphor? A literal shape-shifting search bar. It uses a quite literal search bar, which morphs from a horizontal rectangle, to a more Google Nexus-shaped tablet, and finally, a Google Pixel. It’s quite smart, and does shed light on how the company is fundamentally evolving into a true Microsoft and Apple competitor, without forgetting its real strengths. But before I give the entire ad away, have a look at what Google believes will be the new future of the company in the coming years. Also, if you missed the Google Pixel launch this week, be sure to visit Gearburn for an extensive recap of the event.

Sure it was a little rude, but at least it gave Apple fans something to do while all eyes were focused on Google. We already showed you how to install iOS 10.1 beta 2 on your iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have a developer account, and it’s ridiculously easy to do. Some people prefer to keep things legit though, and luckily the wait between Apple’s developer beta releases and its public beta releases isn’t long at all. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 blind camera test: Guess which model hardcore Apple fans picked Apple on Wednesday released the latest beta version of its iOS 10.1 software, iOS 10.1 public beta 2. The new build is packed full of bug fixes, and you’ll also find refinements as well as a few new features. What’s more, iPhone 7 Plus users who install iOS 10.1 public beta 2 will gain access to Apple’s Portrait Mode feature, which uses the 7 Plus’ dual lens camera to create a bokeh effect on photographs so that they look similar to photos captured using a high-quality DSLR camera. If you want the new iOS 10.1 public beta 2 software on your iPhone or iPad, all you need to do is sign up on this page on Apple’s website. You’ll then be able to download and install a special beta profile on your iPhone or iPad, which will give you access to iOS 10.1 public beta 2. Once the profile is installed, simply go to Settings > Genera > Software Update and follow the on-screen instructions to install the update.

By Gary Robbins / The San Diego Union-Tribune Devices in people’s homes and offices that are connected to the internet — things such as routers and cameras, rice makers and thermostats — could increasingly be taken over by hackers in the coming weeks and used to suppress free speech and commit crime. Cybersecurity experts have been issuing the warning since last week, when a piece of software involved in a major cyber attack was publicly released for anyone to tap. Days earlier, hackers used this so-called “Mirai malware” to identify hundreds of thousands of home and office devices that had weak security. The hackers then stitched those devices into a network that sent a blizzard of messages to Brian Krebs, shutting down the popular website he runs to expose cyber crimes. Experts are describing the attack as a threat to free speech, and it underscores that there’s a quickly emerging dark side to the widely dubbed Internet of Things — everyday devices that are connected to the web or to each other. Consumers are being urged to change the passwords on their web-connected devices, which in some homes can entail 15 or more objects ranging from a smart TV to Amazon Alexa to a Mr. Coffee brewing machine. In some cases, rebooting the devices will disable the malware. But like a virus, a fresh attack is likely to occur again. Many of these household devices have little or no security shield. “Five years ago, most people couldn’t easily access the security cameras in their own homes or use the internet to turn off lights throughout the house,” said Clifford Neuman, director of the Center for Computer Systems Security at the University of Southern California. “But now, these things are easy-to-use, mass-market devices, and hackers are using them as a steppingstone to launch attacks.” The vulnerability is especially challenging because today’s modern household contains a growing number of internet-connected gadgets. On Tuesday, Google announced a “smart speaker” called Google Home that can play music, field questions and control compatible lights and appliances; it can also access access users’ calendars, Google Maps and other services if they allow. Hackers have existed since the advent of computers, but the Internet of Things is comparatively new. It began gaining broad public attention in 2008, when the number of web-connected devices surpassed the number of people on Earth. Reliable figures are hard to come by. But analysts estimate that there are 23 billion such devices worldwide today — and that the figure could hit 50 billion in 2020. The devices include home security cameras, routers, DVRs, doorbell and window lock systems, refrigerators, toasters, espresso machines, electronic picture frames, humidifiers, baby and pet monitors, motion detectors, lawnmowers, pet collars, night lights, aquarium monitors and a variety of toys such as Barbie dolls. “If I want my garage door to be accessible on my smartphone [in case my wife leaves it open by accident], I need to be willing to accept the risk of a criminal hacker taking it over,” said Lance Larson, assistant director of the graduate program in homeland security at San Diego State University. Hackers are increasingly releasing malware such as Mirai onto the internet, where it searches for web-connected devices that have poor or nonexistent security measures. Once Mirai infects those machines, the hackers can combine them into a network, or botnet, that collectively sends a massive volume of traffic to a targeted website, disrupting or shutting it down. The technique is called a distributed denial of service, or DDoS. In addition, hackers can use a DDoS to attempt to extort money from businesses and people, or to disrupt their sites for political reasons. The presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have both been hit by this type of sabotage. “Internet of Things devices, in general, are the perfect platform for attackers to issue DDoS attacks,” said Mordechai Guri, chief science officer for the cybersecurity startup Morphisec in Newton, Mass. “Most of the time they remain idle, hence they can be easily abused for DDoS purposes. Secondly, [these] devices, due to their diversity and complexity, have almost no in-device security products installed (e.g., anti-virus). Consequentially, attackers can easily spread their malicious bot … without being detected for a long time. “Third, they are prevalent, so botnets on [web-connected] devices in the future may consist of millions of bots to address. Finally, such an attack is difficult to mitigate … . Unlike ordinary PCs, removal of malware from Internet of Things devices is a challenging issue in itself.” There’s yet another related threat, one that hasn’t been getting much attention. It involves profiling people. “Anyone with access to a fully connected home can build a detailed profile about the occupants,” said Alfred Chung, senior product manager at Guidance Software in Pasadena, Calif. “They can gather data about the time of day when the home is occupied, the number of people inside the home at various times, personal details like age, appearance and gender of those living in the home … With connected appliances, they can even tell what food occupants store in their fridge.” The nature of the problem was exposed by the attack on cybersecurity authority Mr. Krebs, an incident that caught the attention of Craig Spiezle, executive director of the Online Trust Alliance in Bellevue, Wash. Referring to Mr. Krebs’ troubles, Mr. Spiezle said in a statement that it underscored the threat to the overall public: “In this increasingly complex world of connected devices, consumers cannot take it for granted that their devices remain safe, secure and private year after year. “As people acquire more devices, the long term risks to their family and community rise exponentially.” Associated Press contributed.

Follow TechnoBuffalo There are few things worse than buying a phone that comes with carrier apps preloaded. It’s a practice that, even in the year 2016, continues to exist much to the dismay of virtually every smartphone owner. So, you’ll be sad to hear that Google’s new Pixel will also come with bloatware if you purchase it through Verizon. Considering how closely Google is trying to follow the Apple model with its Pixel phones, we’re a little surprised to learn these devices will come with bloat. Apple’s iPhone never comes with carrier apps preinstalled (Apple bloat is another story) and it looks like it’ll remain that way for the foreseeable future. The good news is that Verizon will only preload three of its apps from the Google Play Store, including My Verizon, Go90, and VZ Messages. The wording here is a little tricky and we won’t know until the Pixel launches for Verizon later this month, but because the apps are considered “preloaded Play Store apps,” it suggests customers will be able to delete them. Under the “preloaded Verizon apps” section (image below), Verizon doesn’t list anything, so customers won’t have to deal with apps like VZ Navigator or Verizon Cloud. Typically, Verizon devices running Android come with upwards of 10 preloaded apps, so three is a pretty big improvement. Some of the other preloaded Play Store apps, at least on Verizon, include Allo, Duo, Android Pay, Docs, and Keep. I wouldn’t be surprised to see these apps also preloaded with unlocked models as well when they’re available The Google Pixel is currently available for preorder at the Google Store for $649.

When the Samsung Galaxy Nexus made it to Verizon, that Google experience turned to a nightmare for updates. The same phone was only able to get updates whenever Verizon felt like releasing them, so they came with delays. That being said, Verizons Galaxy Nexus stopped getting updates at Jellybean 4.2.2, meanwhile, the GSM unlocked version of the phone did make it to Jellybean 4.3, the last major update for the Galaxy Nexus (it never made it to KitKat 4.4). A Google spokesperson made a statement to 9to5Google which said: "Monthly security updates will come from Google, and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store. Google Pixel ad in USA Today This means that Google will still push security updates to all Pixel (XL) phones including those on Verizon, while significant software updates which change the version number, will be released by Verizon on Pixel phones bought through the carrier or at Best Buy (as Best Buy only sells the Verizon-locked version). As a reminder, the Verizon Pixel phones will not come with an unlockable bootloader. Sidenote: Although ads show the phones are "exclusive to Verizon", which is the only US carrier who will sell the phones, the Google Store will sell Pixel phones unlocked for all US carriers. The ads are misleading in this regard. While we cant tell how quickly Verizon plans to put out major updates for the upcoming Pixel phones, if you want to avoid Verizon holding updates hostage, you can totally pre-order the unlocked version from the Google Store, as it works with all major carriers in the US, including Verizon. The Google Store even offers 24-month no-interest financing options. Do you think Verizon is going to update the Pixel phones to the very end of their life cycles? Or repeat what happened with the Galaxy Nexus? Source | Via Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

The crash occurred in Mountain View, near Google's HQ, when a driver ran a red light and collided with the passenger side door of Google's modified Lexus SUV. The firm revealed today its driver 'voluntarily went to a local hospital where he was evaluated by medical staff and released.' Scroll down for video   Last week, one of Google's cars was involved in one of the worst autonomous vehicle accidents yet, which caused the airbags to be deployed, and caved in both the front and rear side doors GOOGLE'S SELF DRIVING CAR ACTIVITY TO DATE  As of September 30th, 2016: Number of vehicles on the road: 24 Lexus RX450h SUVs and 34 prototype vehicles Miles driven in autonomous mode: 2,102,417 miles Miles driven in manual mode:  1,276,780 miles Average autonomous miles per week: 25,000-26,000 miles  'A Google Lexus-model autonomous vehicle traveling northbound on Phyllis Ave. in Mountain View in manual mode was involved in an accident,' the firm said today. 'As the Google AV proceeded through a green light at the El Camino Real intersection, its autonomous technology detected another vehicle traveling westbound on El Camino Real approaching the intersection at 30 mph and began to apply the Google AV’s brakes in anticipation that the other vehicle would run through the red light.  'The Google AV test driver then disengaged the autonomous technology and took manual control of the Google AV.  'Immediately thereafter, the other vehicle ran through the red light and collided with the right side of the Google AV at 30 mph.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Did something hit SpaceX's rocket before it exploded?

Share this article Share 29 shares CHAINSAW WIELDING MEN AND UNICYCLE RIDERS  The firm also revealed some of the odder things its cars have seen. 'In the last few months, we’ve seen everything from a horseback rider in the middle of the road, to a man wielding a chainsaw in the street (don’t worry, he was trimming trees!), to a couple riding unicycles side-by-side.  'Today, our cars can confidently handle unusual situations like seeing a car (or three!) driving the wrong way down a road. ' Google 's car has learnt to stop horses in the road, the firm said. 'At the time of collision, the Google AV was traveling at 22 mph.' The Google car sustained substantial damage to itsfront and rear passenger doors, the firm said, while the other vehicle sustained significant damage to its front end. There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party.  'However, the Google AV test driver later voluntarily went to a local hospital where he was evaluated by medical staff and released,' the firm said. Since Google began testing its self-driving cars in 2012, the autonomous vehicles have been involved in a number of crashes. Most of these have been minor and at low speeds, so have not caused significant damage to either the car or the person at the wheel.  Due to regulations, the self-driving vehicles must have a person sitting at the steering wheel, to take over in case the car malfunctions.  This is not the first time a Google self-driving car has been involved in an accident.  Speaking to KBCW, James Allen, who witnessed the crash, said: 'I've never seen one in an accident and I see at least 30 to 40 a day.  'They're very good cars, that's why I was so shocked.' The cars are limited to 25 miles per hour, so have on several occasions been rear-ended when driving slowly, or when waiting at a junction. A Google spokesperson told 9to5Google: 'Our light was green for at least six seconds before our car entered the intersection. The technology learns from the different variations that it ‘sees’ on the road, such as multicolored frames, large wheels, bikes with car seats and even unicycles – this allows the cars to ‘better share the road no matter your choice of ride  (Google prototype pictured) 'Thousands of crashes happen everyday on US roads, and red-light running is the leading cause of urban crashes in the US. 'Human error plays a role in 94 per cent of these crashes, which is why we're developing fully self-driving technology to make our roads safer.' Google's autonomous cars have covered over two million miles to date.  But they have also been involved in around 25 accidents, with only one – a collision with a bus – being the fault of the self-driving car.   HOW DID GOOGLE'S CAR LEARN TO DETECT CYCLISTS?  After much observation on the roads and private test tracks, the software in the self-driving vehicles has learned to recognize patterns in behavior, which is now helping the vehicles predict a cyclist’s next move. These sensors have evolved to detect a rider’s hand signals way in advance of the turn and the software has learned to remember previous gestures to better anticipate future riders. ‘Because our cars can see 360 degrees, we’re more aware of cyclists on the road — even in the dark. Take, for example, this tricky situation involving two cyclists at night,’ explains Google. ‘Our car cautiously approached a cyclist that veered into our lane and stopped to avoid another that suddenly turned a corner and rode directly at us against the flow of traffic.’ ‘Our car was able to adapt to this unusual situation, and avoid a potential collision.’ Vehicles will give riders 'ample buffer room' when passing the cars and will not squeeze them into the centre lane. The software has learned to recognize patterns in behavior, which is now helping the vehicles predict a cyclist’s next move. Since no two cyclists are the same, the self-driving cars’ software can also recognize riders of different shapes and sizes. Google has also tested the new technology with 100 'Googlers riding the bicycles around a self-driving car, as it is shown staying in the same spot not to hit any of the riders   Read more: KBCW 9to5Google: Beyond Good and Evil Share or comment on this article e-mail 29 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Update: Verizon says its Pixels will get updates at the same time as Google’s Verizon apparently has turned over a new leaf and "won't stand in the way of updates." by Ron Amadeo - Oct 12, 2016 4:07 pm UTC Login to bookmark 230 Enlarge Google Update 2: Google agrees! The company told Ars "OS updates and monthly security patches will be updated on all Pixel devices (Verizon and non-Verizon versions) simultaneously." Update: A Verizon spokesperson has reached out to Ars with the following corrections about its version of the Pixel: "First and foremost, all operating system and security updates to the Pixel devices will happen in partnership with Google. In other words, when Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates). Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google. Also, the Verizon version of the Google Pixel is carrier unlocked, so you can use it where ever you like. Finally, we have three apps pre-installed on the phone Go90, My Verizon (which is your account management tool) and Verizon Messages (your messaging app). As you noted, all three can easily be uninstalled by the user." Google told 9to5Google that "system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models," which in the past this has meant slower, delayed updates. Verizon seems to be changing its update strategy for the Pixels, and now promises to "not stand in the way of any major updates." We've reached out to Google for comment and clarification. Original story: The Google Pixel phones are coming, and they're even being sold through a carrier: Verizon. I've speculated a few times now that it would be a terrible idea to purchase the Pixel through Verizon, however, and now Google has offered official confirmation that it is indeed a terrible idea to purchase the Pixel through Verizon. Google gave the following statement to 9to5Google: "Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store." This is better than I expected. Security updates will come from Google, so they will actually arrive on time. Verizon, however, is still free to stand in the way of your major updates, so don't expect to get them in a timely manner. The Pixel phone has a very odd relationship with Verizon. In the US, Google and Verizon are advertising the device as a "Verizon Exclusive," but the Pixel phones are also available unlocked from the Google Store, Best Buy, Verizon, Target, and Walmart. Verizon isn't even the only cell carrier with the Pixel—you can also buy it from Google's "Project Fi" MVNO. The "Verizon Exclusive" marketing is doubly confusing when you consider the phone will work on any US carrier. Some people buy devices from a carrier because they don't want to pay the full unlocked price up front, but this year Google is also offering financing plans that are identical to what a carrier would offer. The company also has a two-year "device protection" plan for $100 that is similar to the insurance carriers offer. If you want to buy a Pixel phone, please don't buy the inferior Verizon version. You'll get a locked bootloader, delayed major updates, and there will even be (uninstallable, but still) Verizon crapware. If you really want to use the Pixel on Verizon, we recommend buying it unlocked and slapping in a Verizon SIM.

Worry About a Samsung Virtual Assistant? Nope. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 6, 2016 at 5:02PM Image source: Viv. Given its reputation as a "fast follower," it's kind of shocking that Samsung has yet to release a full-on virtual assistant. I mean, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquired Siri way back in 2010. That was six years ago, and the company subsequently introduced the in-house version of Siri in 2011 with the iPhone 4s. There had been reports last year that Samsung was working on a virtual assistant, leveraging its S Voice technology, but even that is remarkably tardy. Well, the South Korean conglomerate is trying to catch up -- finally. Better late...or never? Samsung has announced that it is acquiring Viv Labs, which was actually created by the same people that created Siri. Samsung wants everyone to know that it's not going to sit on the AI sidelines, and Viv leverages natural language learning and machine learning, while creating a platform for third-party developers. Video source: Samsung. If none of that sounds new, it's because it isn't. All of the major tech players have been working on this stuff for many years, so Samsung is desperately trying to play catch-up via acquisition. Samsung mobile CTO Injong Rhee notes that the company has already made several other acquisitions in this space. This is just as much about competing with Google as it is about competing with Apple Beyond the expected PR language that more or less describes the table stakes for virtual assistants, you have to question the strategic value of Samsung pursuing a virtual assistant. Much to its dismay, Samsung has long relied on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) for Android. Of course, Google launched Google Now many years ago, and has revamped the service as Google Assistant. Google Assistant will become widely available throughout Android as part of 7.1 Nougat, although not all Nougat devices will receive Google Assistant. There's almost no way that Samsung's assistant will be able to outperform Google Assistant, which means that the vast majority of users will end up using Google's assistant. Samsung will not be able to differentiate here, in which case these efforts may be wasted. Samsung's biggest weakness The timing of this acquisition also speaks to the fact that Samsung has never been good at software, a stark contrast to its incredible hardware prowess. That hasn't stopped the company from trying to branch out beyond hardware, but Samsung still has little to show for software innovation even after so many years of trying to become an integrated player. It's entirely true that Apple has sort of underplayed Siri relative to what other peers are doing in virtual assistants. There's no good reason why Apple took so long to open up Siri to third-party developers. Apple was among the first to launch a virtual assistant, but among the last to open up the platform. Still, it seems unlikely that Samsung will make a meaningful mark with this acquisition. No one will buy an exploding Samsung device for a Samsung assistant when Google Assistant is far more useful.

David Kretzmann (TMFPencils) Oct 6, 2016 at 5:05PM Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has just upped the ante in the battle of consumer tech ecosystems. The company released details for multiple hardware products this week, including its Pixel smartphones, Daydream View virtual reality headset, a 4K-compatible Chromecast Ultra, and Google Home smart assistant, among others. Together, these offerings create an attractive portfolio of products that can compete with the best that major rivals have to offer. In this segment, Motley Fool analyst David Kretzmann joins CCTV America to break down the new products and their potential impact on the competitive landscape. A full transcript follows the video. This segment was recorded on Oct. 4, 2016. Michelle Makori: All right. Let's get more on the future of Google with David Kretzmann from the Motley Fool. David, thanks for joining us. David Kretzmann: Thanks for having me. Makori: David, Google wants us to start looking at it as a hardware company. Today, it announced a variety of new made-by-Google products. Let's start with that new Pixel phone. Who should be most threatened by this? Apple? Kretzmann: I don't think Apple's actually going to lose much sleep over the Pixel phone. I would actually be more worried if I'm Samsung with the Note and Galaxy line, especially after some of their phones were exploding a month ago. I think entrenched Android users with Samsung will be more likely to adopt the Pixel phone rather than Apple users switching over to the Pixel. So we'll see, but I would be more worried if I'm Samsung than if I'm Apple. Makori: Google has sold another line of phones before, since 2010, called the Nexus, but those devices haven't gained any traction. Why is this phone so different? Kretzmann: This one is different, because Google is really taking more of the process with hardware and software rather than just the software, which is more the route they took with the Nexus line. This is also a higher end phone going for $650 or more, so a higher end phone, Google has more control and input over the hardware and software, which theoretically should be a product in Google's eyes that consumers will flock to more than the Nexus. Makori: David, you mentioned Samsung. With Google's push into its own hardware, does this now alienate the manufacturers that use its Android operating system like Samsung? Kretzmann: It'll be interesting to see. I see this as a more serious push by Google into the hardware space, so if I'm Samsung, I would see this as a threat. I don't know if it will really impact the relationship as far as Android goes, because Android is the world's most widely adopted mobile operating system. That's a very powerful platform, so I don't know, but if I'm Samsung, like I said, I would be worried that more of their customers would be going to Google's new phone. Makori: David, we just saw some footage over there of the new virtual reality platform and headset that Google announced, Daydream View, made from fabric, more flexible. It goes on sale in November, and they're aiming for it to make it onto Christmas shopping lists. What's your reaction to this? Kretzmann: It still remains to be seen if virtual reality will hit the mainstream this year. I have my doubts that this will really be a mass market product. I think you'll see some early adopters continue to gravitate toward these virtual reality solutions. We also have the Oculus from Facebook, so there are more and more solutions out here. I think this is a nice step for Google, but I remain to be convinced that this is what will really push virtual reality into the mainstream. Makori: You know, David, speaking of mainstream, Google's certainly upping the ante in the digital assistance space with its new home device going against Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. When do you see the whole voice-activated home assistant device space really catching on? Kretzmann: Artificial intelligence is certainly here to stay. Obviously, you have Apple with Siri. You have Alexa with Amazon and the Echo device. Google really made a big push into the smart home today with Google Home, really trying to connect devices through voice and have all those devices be interconnected so you can talk to your Google Chromecast, your Google Home, your Google tablets, your smartphone of course, so really communicating across all these devices. I think people really will see artificial intelligence become more ingrained in their daily lives, and that's really what it comes down to for Apple, Google, and Amazon. It's a competition among ecosystems, and I think artificial intelligence is one avenue to strengthen those ecosystems. As people get more used to utilizing artificial intelligence in their daily lives, that makes ecosystems for all three of those companies all the more powerful. Makori: Yeah. Absolutely. Let's take this another direction quickly, David. Lots of ground to cover. Google and parent company Alphabet have also been building and operating self-driving vehicles, and Google's saying today that its end goal is not to make autonomous cars but to create autonomous drivers to pilot them. What's your take on that? Kretzmann: You're seeing a lot of companies go that route, whether it's Uber or Lyft, and you also have Ford and GM and the established automakers going that direction. I think Google is opting more for building the software of the operating system for self-driving cars. As you mentioned, the company is not trying to get into the business of auto manufacturing itself, but a million lives are lost globally on roads at the hand of car accidents, so there's a huge opportunity here to improve the well-being of people's lives around the world who lose their lives or get seriously injured in car accidents. Google really looks to focus on high-impact avenues, whether it's self-driving cars or smartphones or things in medicine. Whatever it might be, the company really looks to tackle these key issues, and I think self-driving cars, it's an important issue. I don't think they'll be readily adopted any time soon, in the next couple years, but we'll see. More and more companies pour resources into that technology.

That doesn’t mean you can’t buy an unlocked version of the phone, but it did raise some questions about how the updates for Pixel will be handled for those that do decide on the Verizon version of the phone. During the #madebygoogle event, Google advertised a new seamless update process in Nougat to make OTA updates as painless as they can be. Unfortunately, this is a feature that is only going to be on phones that ship with Nougat, meaning Pixel (and other new Android devices) will utilize this feature while Nexus phones can’t. Seamless updates work by creating two partitions on the device. The active system partition is what you use every day. When an OTA happens, the active partition downloads it and then updates the dormant partition, which is a mirror image of the current active partition. When the phone is rebooted, the dormant partition becomes the active partition and the previous partition becomes dormant after applying the update. That’s great and all, but how does Verizon factor into this? A Google rep has confirmed that Google will handle all of the monthly security updates for the Pixel, while Verizon themselves will be on the hook for bigger updates. Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store. That means no matter how seamless the updates are in Nougat, you’ll still be waiting for Verizon to push them out. local_offer    Google   Pixel   Pixel XL   Verizon   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (49) stars Further Reading The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again The Play Store sees another update Verizon launches BOGO deal Google starts selling OtterBox cases Exclusive: Project ARA specifications, design stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Liz Stinson Design Date of Publication: 10.06.16. 10.06.16 Time of Publication: 6:21 pm. 6:21 pm Meet Noto, Google’s Free Font for More Than 800 Languages Google Something funny happens when your computer or phone can’t display a font: A blank rectangular box pops up in place of the missing glyph. This little box is called .notdef, or “not defined,” in coder lingo, but everyone else just calls it tofu. Bob Jung hates tofu. His loathing started in the 1980s while living in Tokyo, where he owned an American computer. “In those days, if you bought an American computer you didn’t get fonts in other languages,” he says. “So it was quite common to see tofu.” Now he leads Google’s Internationalization department, ensuring that the company’s products work everywhere. His team spent six years working with designers at Monotype to banish tofu from Google’s devices with a cohesive, pan-language set of fonts called Noto (short for “no more tofu”). Noto, one of the most expansive typographic families ever made, supports 800 languages, 100 scripts in up to eight different weights, innumerable special characters, and absolutely no tofu. Google Noto solves a big usability issue that most people don’t know exists. If you write in languages like English, Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, or Russian, for example, you rarely see tofu. Such languages are supported by Unicode, the consortium that approves emoji and maintains software internationalization standards, and your devices come with them. But people read and write in hundreds of languages. Unicode only recently approved Tibetan. Ditto Armenian. Many more await approval. If these less common languages have a digital typeface, it’s probably not well considered, because “certain regions of the world have much more rich typographic traditions than others,” says Steve Matteson, Monotype’s creative director. He led hundreds of researchers, designers, and linguists in giving every Unicode-enabled script a font, and ensuring those fonts feel like part of the same typographic family. In the past, platforms licensed fonts for different scripts piecemeal (a script can cover a number of languages—English, Icelandic, and Dutch are just three of the dozens of languages that rely on Latin script). So they’d buy one for Latin scripts like Spanish and French, another for Arabic scripts, and yet another for Japanese and Chinese. “You’d get this mishmash of fonts,” Jung says. “That was always the complaint we got—fonts just don’t look good when you mix languages.” But developing a typeface for 800 languages that feels cohesive yet respectful of each language’s cultural heritage created inherent tension. And making those fonts “unmistakably Google” is nearly impossible. The Tibetan script, for example, draws heavily from a calligraphic tradition, while English is more linear and geometric. The Arabic typeface is emphasized in left to right strokes, while French’s letters carry their weight in their vertical stems. Some fonts, like Runic, are so obscure that typographers at Monotype built the font from scratch using stone engravings for inspiration. Google The goal was to create a family of fonts that appear at least distantly related. “We wanted to make it so when people changed their language settings it didn’t look like they were using a completely different platform,” Matteson says. He designed Noto to be modern but friendly, with open counters, soft terminals, and strokes rooted in 5th century calligraphy. He avoided making Noto too austere, mostly because the shapes wouldn’t translate as nicely to other languages. “It’s not easy to interpret fancy calligraphic languages like Tibetan into a Futura typeface model, which is all circles and straight lines,” he says. You’ll see some common shapes echoed throughout fonts within the Noto family. Every font has a similar weight, providing some semblance of continuity. And although not all languages rest at the same baseline and capline (letters in Asian languages tend to stand taller than those in Latin languages), they align to an imaginary line that bisects the Latin alphabet. These finely tuned details are what makes Noto’s ambition so impressive. It’s not the first time most of these languages are getting a typeface, but it is the first time they’ve been bound together by a cohesive visual language. Go Back to Top.

I barely use voice assistants, but it's hard to argue that the tech top dogs think they're the way forward. Amazon and Google are currently battling for control of the living room with Echo and Google Home, and Siri, Google Now and Cortana are competing on mobile, so it's perhaps no surprise to see Samsung beefing up its own offering. And that's exactly what the Galaxy phone maker has done with the purchase of Viv Labs, the team behind the artificial-intelligence software Viv, which aims to handle your everyday tasks without any intervention. You may not have heard of Viv – it's yet to launch – but you'll be familiar with its founders' work. Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham were the brains behind Siri, but they left Apple two years after the acquisition to found Viv. It hasn't been revealed how much the Samsung paid for the company, but it's understood that Viv and its 50 or so San Jose-based employees will continue to work independently of the Samsung mothership. Video of [Interview] Dag Kittlaus, Co-founder and CEO of Viv, Discusses the Future of AI with Samsung   What will this actually mean for Samsung? Well, presumably in the short term it's hoping that people will stop using Google Now on its flagship phones, but there could be more than that too. If Amazon Echo and Google Home take off, then Samsung could try its own version, but there's no reason to stop there either. Unlike Apple or HTC, Samsung devices are all over the house, from televisions to washing machines. Viv could sit within all these devices, adding a sprinkling of artificial intelligence throughout your house. Viv Labs claims that Viv is not your average artificial intelligence, and is able to write its own code to complete new tasks as they appear – something they call “dynamic program generation”. As it hasn't yet launched, it's hard to speculate as to how impressive this will be in practice, but Samsung clearly sees potential there. It may be a few years yet before we see any practical commercial benefits, but this is an unambiguous statement of intent against Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.

But since the Nexus lineup is pretty much dead, so is that concept, or at least in part. It seems that not only will the Pixel phones sold through Verizon come with a locked bootloader, but it has also been confirmed that the Verizon will be handling the system updates for the Pixel phones sold through the carrier. This means that whenever a new Android update is released, Pixel owners will have to wait for Verizon, not Google, to push it out to their phones. “Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store.” Now to be fair, this is a first for both Google and Verizon so for all we know, Verizon could be prompt with how they handle the system updates, but given how carriers and OEMs have handled Android updates in the past, it is easy to see why many are a bit skeptical about this. We’re not sure how Verizon managed to secure themselves this deal, but it seems that it is only limited to Verizon for now so if you’d rather not have the carrier manage your updates, you should probably purchase the phone elsewhere.

SHARE THIS STORY Tweet Charles Murito, the Google Africa Strategic Partnerships head, made the remarks Thursday while addressing a Top 100 mid-sized companies’ conference in Nairobi. The Top 100 is an annual competition that seeks to identify the best managed SMEs in the region. It is organised by the Nation Media Group and financial consulting firm KPMG. Mr Murito cited the rapid growth in the number of Kenyans browsing the Internet and those making purchases online as both an opportunity and a risk for traditional businesses that risk being wiped out by emerging competitors that use social media to market their products. “Ninety per cent of Kenyans have mobile phones out of which 44 per cent now have Internet-ready phones and with mobile devices getting cheaper every day, we now have 75 per cent of middle class Kenyans booking and shopping  online where they pay goods and services via cashless transactions on their phones,” he said. On Thursday’s conference was a precursor to today’s gala dinner in which this year’s Top 100 mid-sized companies will be unveiled. The competition, now in its ninth year in Kenya, has since expanded to Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. Up to 604 companies applied to enter this year’s competition. The Nation Media Group Chief Executive Joe Muganda said SMEs must invest heavily in research to understand their customers’ preferences. “As a media group we have had to increase our reader interactions online to remain relevant to our market,’’ Mr Muganda said.

The two companies describe the font family – named Noto – as one of the biggest typography projects ever undertaken. The result of more than five years' work, Noto covers more than 800 languages and 100 written scripts. And work on it will continue into the future to add scripts that are currently incompatible with computers. Numbers, emoji, symbols and musical notation are also included in the typeface, which comes in multiple serif and sans-serif styles of up to eight weights. Noto is designed to eliminate "tofu" – the square boxes that appear in place of text when a font is not available on the device, so-called because they look like blocks of bean curd. The typeface is said to realise Google's dream of seeing "no more tofu". Google and Monotype claim Noto will not only help people to communicate across the world, it will assist to preserve information written in endangered languages. "Even though we prioritise widely used languages, we still want to support other languages, even if there are no people still speaking them," said Google product manager Xiangye Xiao. "There are some characters you can only see on stones." "If you don't move them to the web, over time those stones will become sand and we'll never be able to recover those drawings or that writing." Related story Google launches omniscient voice-controlled Home device Google and Monotype are sharing Noto under an open font licence, meaning it is free to use, modify and distribute. Designers and developers are invited to adapt the typeface. Work on Noto will be ongoing to keep up with updates to the Unicode Standard – the computing industry standard for encoding text so that it can be read consistently across machines. When Google and Monotype began their project in 2011, Unicode 6.0 had just been released. The standard is now up to version 9.0, and the companies will continue to work together to add scripts from each new standard to the Noto library. "I feel that looking into the future of digital communications, Google Noto is going to be the go-to design for people to be using to communicate across multiple cultures and societies," said Monotype's creative type director, Steve Matteson. Monotype, one of the world's biggest type foundries, has previously worked on high-profile projects like a digital-friendly update to the London Tube's 100-year-old typeface. While Google provided design direction, Monotype is responsible for the look of Noto. The company worked with designers and linguists from around the world to create the characters in Noto's library. Google's vast resources funded the project, making extensive testing and review possible. The release of Noto continues a big week for the company, which launched a new smartphone, connected home device and virtual reality headset on Tuesday.

While the Pixels sold by Verizon will be the same as the ones sold by Google when it comes to hardware, things will be a bit different when it comes to software. Google has confirmed that Verizon will handle the system updates for the Pixel and Pixel XL units that it sells. Meanwhile, Google will handle the security updates. Here’s the full statement given to 9to5Google by a Google spokesperson:  "Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store." That means that if you buy a Pixel or Pixel XL from Verizon, you will get security updates straight from Google, which is good since security is important. However, when it comes to system updates, which means Android OS updates, you’ll be waiting to get your updates from Verizon.  We’ll have to wait and see how Verizon does with its Pixel system updates, but the fear is that you could be waiting for updates on a Verizon Pixel longer than you would if you had a Google Pixel. When you’re buying a Pixel, one of the perks is speedy software updates, but that could change if a non-Google entity is responsible for your Pixel’s system updates. Again, the Pixel phones haven’t even hit consumers’ hands yet, so we’ll just have to wait and see how Verizon handles the updates for its Pixel phones. But if you want to guarantee that you’ll get updates as fast as possible on your Pixel, you may want to look into buying from Google.

Hallisey was honored for her work developing a lost-cost Ebola test that does not require refrigeration and costs a fraction of the $1,000 tests now in use. “Greenwich is full of people that are making history today and she’s one of them,” said Debra Mecky, executive director of the Greenwich Historical Society. “She’s the future.” Hallisey was the grand prize winner at the 2015 Google Science Fair for her Ebola work. She is the first and only Greenwich High student to reach the global finals of the Google competition, which is open to all students ages 13 to 18. “I’ve really always been interested in health care and global citizenry,” said Hallisey. “ I’m just trying to do my best to help.” Hallisey began the research for her test in Greenwich High’s Honors Science Research Program. In January 2016, she appeared on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” to discuss her Ebola test and her Google Science Fair win. “I began looking at how can we limit the spread of Ebola because the problem I saw is how quickly it was spreading,” Hallisey told Colbert. The drama and the stigma associated with Ebola attracted her, she added in an interview this week. Impressed, Colbert said, "I don’t know whether to be inspired or intimidated by you right now." Currently, Hallisey is working on a scientific paper about her Ebola test. She said she hopes to be able to apply the same technology to tests for the Zika virus and Lyme disease. Hallisey was recognized by the Greenwich Historical Society Wednesday after a lecture by veteran CBS “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl. Hallisey’s name will be the first on a Greenwich Makes History plaque which will be installed at the Greenwich Historical Society. “I’m really honored,” said Hallisey. “I grew up in Greenwich, I go to school in Greenwich; it’s really cool to be honored by my home town.” Jessica Guff , co-chair of the event, “An Evening with Lesley Stahl,” announced Hallisey’s award and said, “She answered a call that no one else was able to do.” emunson@hearstmediact.com; @emiliemunson Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Duck Brand Shrink Film Indoor Window Kit for $7 + pickup at...

Home News Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones Verizon will push Pixel updates for models it sells Pixel will be updated through Google if you buy from Google, Verizon if you buy from Verizon By: Sean Ridgeley | Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones News | Posted: Oct 6, 2016 9:32 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Though Pixel is a Google phone, the company has partnered exclusively with Verizon for its latest. That might lead you to wonder: am I getting my updates through Verizon (and late, at that), or through Google (in a timely fashion)? Apparently, both.     "Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store," explained a Google spokesperson.   In other words, buy from Google, as the finance options are the same and you can still use your unlocked model on Verizon, so there's no downside and one major upside.

At $79, the Daydream View joins Samsung’s Gear VR among the cheaper headsets in the race, although the overall cost is higher because both require specific late-model smartphones. “The significance of Daydream is it should move the VR theme forward because it raises the hardware bar on phones needed for VR,” said a report from Piper Jaffray, which predicted that most smartphones running Google’s Android software will be made with Daydream in mind within five years. “The reality is that most people have yet to try VR,” said Mike Jazayeri, Google’s Daydream product director. Headset and controller will cost $79 when it goes on sale in November at Verizon, Best Buy and the online Google store. The headset alone costs $399, but a $499 bundle includes two PlayStation Move handheld controllers, a PlayStation camera and a game. [...] the Rift requires a PC with a powerful graphics card and processors, which could send the overall cost past $1,500. Last week, HTC opened Viveport, an online store in 30 countries for non-gaming VR experiences to augment its selection of VR games. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - on October 5, 2016< > Embed Google Daydream Teases Harry Potter Game 00:42 Harry Potter fans rejoice!

Finance Search Mon, Nov 14, 2016, 2:11 PM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 1 hr 49 mins Twitter plunges as buyout hopes fadeAFP – Thu, Oct 6, 2016 9:57 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo The Twitter logo displayed on a banner outside the New York Stock Exchange Twitter shares went into a tailspin Thursday as hopes faded for a buyout for the struggling social network. Shares in Twitter sank 20 percent to close at $19.87, giving back most of the gains from speculation in recent weeks of a buyout by a major tech or media group. On Wednesday, technology news site Recode said Google parent Alphabet would not pursue a Twitter acquisition. Google had been seen by some observers as one of the more likely purchasers. Neither Twitter nor Google responded to a request for comment. Recode also reported that other potential suitors were also cooling -- that Apple was unlikely to pursue a bid and that Disney had no plans to make an offer. Talks remain active between cloud computing group Salesforce.com and Twitter, according to some reports. After falling to its lowest point ever earlier this year, Twitter shares were boosted recently on hopes the company will gain traction or a make a promising match with a suitor. Twitter, which celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, has yet to make a profit. Co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as chief executive last year but has yet to ignite growth, with the number of users stagnating at slightly more than 300 million for several quarters. Twitter was expected to begin accepting bids this week, reports said. The social messaging platform would be a big-ticket item, with its value based on the share price topping $17 billion on Wednesday, and the company likely to want a premium to be paid. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Woodside signs up ex-minister MacfarlaneAAP Deal-hungry energy giant Woodside Petroleum has appointed former federal resources and energy minister Ian Macfarlane … Ian Macfarlane joins Woodside boardAAP Home loans rose 0.9% in SeptAAP Underground rail to link CBD to ParramattaAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7553 +0.0013 +0.17% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6008 +0.0019 +0.32% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6988 +0.0032 +0.46% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Robert Vaughn Toyota AU US refugee Gumtree Four Nations Perth Accommodation Trump protests Car insurance comparison Cecil the Lion Life insurance Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Google has apparently confirmed to 9to5Google that Verizon will be in charge of delivering Android software updates to all Pixel phones that it sells. That includes units purchased from Best Buy, since the popular electronics store is carrying Verizon's Pixel models and not an unlocked version of the "phone by Google." For Pixels purchased from the Google Store, Google will handle updates itself — just as it did with Nexus devices. Here's the statement a spokesperson gave 9to5Mac: Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store. That's probably bad news for Verizon buyers who want the latest Android features as soon as they're available. Any middleman between Google and its users could result in delays. The Pixel that Google sells directly is fully compatible with Verizon's network, so you can just purchase that way to avoid potential headaches entirely. That also means you won't have to deal with any Verizon-branded applications that the carrier preloads onto its Pixel devices. But most people buy smartphones from carrier stores, and Google knows that. There are already full-page newspaper and magazine ads touting Verizon's "exclusivity." USA TODAY, Wall Street Journal and New York Times today. Google's going to be everywhere advertising Pixel pic.twitter.com/y766m8QLGX — Eli Blumenthal (@eliblumenthal) October 5, 2016 So Google is taking control in one key area: security. The company will deliver monthly security updates for the Pixel — both the unlocked and Verizon variants. At least when it comes to defending against the latest Android exploits, they'll be on equal footing. Now once the Pixel is actually released, hopefully some resourceful Android nerds will find a way to just make the Verizon-sold hardware behave like it came straight from Google. But most average consumers will be depending the carrier for updates. If you want to be absolutely certain you'll keep current with Android, just buy the thing from Google. The monthly financing works out roughly the same, and either method gets you a free Daydream View.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM professionals Research Legal updates Events International directory Media ‘Alt-right’ using brand names as racist code words – and companies are powerless to stop them 06 Oct 16 < Back to Blogs Tim Lince Online communities of so-called ‘alt right’ internet users have developed code words to hide bigoted slurs on social media in a bid to avoid perceived censorship. The code uses high-profile brand names, including Google, Yahoo and Skype, to substitute for offensive words to describe ethnic groups including African Americans, Mexicans and Jews. World Trademark Review has spoken to experts about what the affected brand owners can do  – but in terms of legal remedies, the options appear to be limited. The coding system was adopted in response to Google’s new Jigsaw programme, which aims to combat online abuse and harassment through the use of an automated artificial intelligence program. It was also created as a way for followers of the so-called ‘alt-right’ ideology – a right-wing movement often associated with white nationalist and anti-Semitic views – to avoid being banned or suspended on social networks, most commonly on Twitter, for using racist terms. The coding system originates from an alt-right message board on forum platform 4chan, with one user responding to Google’s AI program by saying “if Google wants to block offensive words, then [we] are going to give them the most offensive word to block: GOOGLE”. Another user, who created a social media image to promote this tactic, wrote: “Google will not include a page on its search results if it contains ‘offensive’ words – so use the word Google on social media when referring to one or many [offensive term for African Americans] to damage the Google brand, and don’t forget to use the Google logo on appropriate images.” So-called ‘Operation Google’ soon expanded and led to the creation of a full set of code words as a substitute for various offensive terms. This includes the aforementioned ‘Googles’ as a derogatory word for African Americans, ‘Skypes’ as a derogatory word for Jewish people, ‘Bings’ as a derogatory word for Asian Americans, ‘Yahoos’ as a derogatory word for Mexicans and ‘Skittles’ as a derogatory word for Muslims (the latter apparently originating from a Donald Trump Jr tweet comparing a bowl of Skittles to Syrian refugees). The full list can be viewed here (warning: contains offensive terms). A search on Twitter reveals countless uses of the terms in such contexts. For example, one tweet from an account called ‘AltRightInfo’, which has over 13,000 followers, used the trademarked terms as lower-case nouns: “If a genie granted me a wish, I'd ban googles, yahoos, skypes and skittles.” In fact, a Twitter search for ‘Skypes’, ‘Skittles’ or ‘Yahoos’ show numerous tweets in the last 24 hours using the terms in relation to ethnic groups. Furthermore, discussion about the code system is on the rise too (such as podcast personality Alex Goldman tweeting about the code to his 35,000 followers, garnering 15,000 retweets), further promoting the association between the brand names and the offensive terms. This could, of course, be a reputationally damaging situation for all of the associated brands. But as well-known trademarked terms, can their in-house IP counsel do anything to halt this use? Probably not, says Ed Timberlake, an attorney-at-law at Forrest Firm. “Since these code words, to my knowledge, are being used outside the context of commercial activity, it would appear that such utterances fall squarely within the realm of free speech,” he explains. “That words registered for use as trademarks in certain commercial contexts are also (one might reluctantly say innovatively) being used distastefully as code words for racist sentiments, doesn't change the fact that people expressing such sentiments are entirely free to do so regardless of their significance in a commercial context. If the code words were also being used in commerce in a trademark manner, to indicate the source of whatever, it might be a different matter and a cease-and-desist letter might make sense as one option to consider.” While legal remedies may be limited, that’s not to say the brands should do nothing. On the contrary, says Dykema's trademark practice lead Eric T. Fingerhut, it is important for the brands to do something regarding the misuse of their trademarks. “No-one is not going to buy Skittles because some alt-right group on Twitter is referring to them as Muslims,” he notes. “However, I do think that the consumers of Skittles would have a lot more respect for the brand if they address and call out this kind of misuse.” One approach, according to Timberlake, would be similar to Wrigley’s recent response to Trump Jr’s Skittles tweet. “I sympathize with any company experiencing such a situation, but I'm not sure it's one of those cases where tough legal action is better,” he states. “My sense is that the better approach might be to craft a simple public statement, making it clear that your words, your trademarks and your company stand for something better. If you were completely bold, one might even defend in such a statement the right of others to use words distastefully, while making it clear that you're better than that.” He warned, though, that brands should be wary in their response because “any efforts to silence such speech would likely just shower more attention on the matter”. Another option, says Fingerhut, is getting the terms added to the ‘offensive’ words list that the policy teams at Twitter and other social platforms use when policing hate speech. “If I were in-house at Google, I would be on the phone in a second with all the other counsel at these affected companies,” he explains. “I would then send a strongly-worded joint letter to social media platforms to make them fully aware of the situation. Let’s remember that the reason this alt-right group is doing this in the first place is because use of the actual offensive words would be in obvious violation of their policies. So if a company name becomes synonymous with those same racist terms, then Twitter and other social networks may take down the posts for hate speech. If that happens, then the content could be reported and taken down. That's not necessarily legal, but it is clearly against the de facto Twitter policy and, in this day and age, that is often the law that we follow." The thought process should be similar to that of how brands approach the threat of genericide, Fingerhut concludes: “Generic misuse of a trademark is often not legally actionable, but a brand owner will pursue it because it is the ultimate form of trademark dilution and you therefore want it to stop. The same rule applies when your trademark becomes synonymous, in an underground way, with hate speech. Therefore, you want to call it out because it helps to prevent it, even if it isn't legally actionable. Ultimately, in this era of social media transparency, if a company knows about this type of misuse, then it has a duty to be a responsible brand and shine a light on it." It is an unquestionably uncomfortable situation for all the brands involved, and one that requires walking a fine line between elements including reputation management, trademark rights, hate speech and free expression. But while legal options are limited, tenacious trademark counsel do have brand reputation and policy approaches they can pursue.  Channels User generated content Brand strategy Business strategy Social networks Internet issues Brand In-house issues Comments Please log in or register to leave a comment.

Joshua Brustein @joshuabrustein More stories by Joshua Brustein October 6, 2016 — 3:25 PM EDT So far, the landscape of virtual reality has been split between two types of headsets: expensive, high-end devices like the Oculus Rift that require PCs and external cameras, and cheap devices like Google’s Cardboard and Daydream that use smartphones as displays, sacrificing quality to make a mass-market product. This week, Facebook and Google made it clear that they’re both rushing toward a middle ground. At a conference for developers, Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Oculus was making a headset that wouldn’t require users to tether themselves to a PC. He showed a short video of a prototype that had no wires and seemed to contain the processors in a compartment sitting at the back of the wearer’s head. Like so much of what is happening in virtual reality, the presentation was more on the promise of a glorious future than a depiction of anything tangible that is happening in the present day. “I don’t want you to get your hopes up yet,” said Zuckerberg. “We have a demo, but we don’t have a product.” From a technical perspective, a major challenge in creating such a device is devising a way to track a person’s movements without a separate camera. So-called positional tracking allows a virtual world to be more responsive to the physical actions made by someone wearing a VR headset. It’s one of the fundamental differences between the Oculuses of the world and the Cardboards. With the Oculus, a camera mounted on a PC watches for the movement of sensors placed on the headset, a technique known as outside-in positional tracking. Having sensors on the device itself do that tracking is known as inside-out tracking. Zuckerberg said this technique was something Oculus engineers are now hard at work on. It’s also the focus of Project Tango, an undertaking at Alphabet's Google happening under the auspices of its virtual reality team. Right now, Tango exists separately of Daydream, but a device incorporating both ideas could result in a high-end virtual reality experience powered by a smartphone.  “Everyone’s making a big deal of when inside-out mobile positional tracking be solved. Here’s a team that’s been doing it for awhile,” said Clay Bavor, Google’s vice president for virtual reality. “Tango is part of my team, so we sit in the same building. You can extrapolate that in several ways.”  When asked whether he had a timeline for a device that combined Google’s smartphone-based virtual reality platforms with the positional tracking of Project Tango, Bavor smiled coyly and said yes. “It’s one thing to have the technical capability to do something. It’s another thing to get it into a product that people are going to love,” he said.  Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

Bavor said these dynamics have steered Google away from building a PC-based VR device that competes directly with those from Facebook or HTC. But the simpler devices have technical shortcomings that some developers worry will leave people underwhelmed. When Cardboard was released, there was a backlash about even referring to it as virtual reality. So many people are waiting impatiently for headset companies to figure out products that find a sweet spot that can get full-featured VR to a mass audience, through something that might look at lot like Google's Daydream with inside-out positional tracking. “That, to me, is the golden fusion moment,” said Aaron Koblin, chief technical officer at VR developer Within.  Zuckerberg was about as vague as Bavor about putting a timeline on the development of a mid-range VR headset. Not everyone is convinced that such a future is imminent. Shawn Layden, president of Sony Interactive Entertainment, said his company is solely focused on the PlayStation VR, which connects to the company's gaming console and goes on sale later this month. “I think they’re two separate and distinct experiences. The high-end console experience you have with the PSVR or the other PC-driven systems really just can’t be replicated right now with the cellphone technologies,” Layden said. “Who’s to say over time whether those converge? I can’t.”  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Today, October 6, Google search queries for “What does Trump Pence mean” went up 3,4000 percent, the search “Trump Pence meaning” went up 1,700 percent, and “What is Trump Pence” went up 1,350 percent. The majority of the searches came from the United States, Canada, and Australia. It may be a cause for concern that citizens in our country are still seemingly uninformed about the presidential candidates’ initiatives for the country, let alone who the nominee’s vice-president candidate is. On Jimmy Kimmel Live! this week, Jimmy went out onto the streets and was surprised to find out how many American citizens thought that there was a “First Lady Debate.” “Now obviously, there was no First Lady debate, although it would be pretty great if there was. There’s never been a First Lady debate and Bill Clinton is not a lady.” While this was done for a comedic purpose, it is pretty scary how little our citizens know about politics. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vG8lVhyWPmI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Some people are saying, “Do not vote, unless you’re informed.” However, if all of these people are uninformed, there is a pretty good chance a large percentage of them will be voting. People have a responsibility as citizens of this country to inform themselves about the candidates and issues on the ballot well before election day. Recently, an opinion piece was published in the Wall Street Journal by Dorothy Rabinowitz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the newspaper, urging people, especially uninformed voters, to vote for Hillary Clinton. The piece was titled “Hillary-Hated Derangement Syndrome.” “Her election alone is what stands between the American nation and the reign of the most unstable, proudly uninformed, psychologically unfit president ever to enter the White House.” The journalist attacks Trump and his supporters. “They are aware of his casual disregard for truth, his self-obsession, his ignorance, his ingrained vindictiveness.” Hillary Clinton is struggling to win over the millennial vote. Clinton is looking to former Vice President Al Gore to help her energize the youth vote on the issue of climate change. Clinton also wants Gore to reinforce the lasting consequences of voting for a third party candidate, given his experience back in 2000.

What’s next for Twitter: Salesforce or the abyss? Posted on Thursday, October 6, 2016 by CNN in Business News Would you rather see Twitter stay independent or get bought by a company that calls itself a “customer success platform?” This suddenly appears to be the most likely choice facing the ailing social network, and the answer to the question may simply be: damned if you do, damned if you don’t. Twitter stock surged on rumors that Google, Disney and Salesforce were interested in an acquisition, with the potential for others like Apple to sniff around. But on Thursday, the stock plunged nearly 20% following a report from Re/code that Google, Disney and Apple aren’t planning to bid for Twitter. A separate report from CNBC said other bidders are “taking a look,” but remained vague. Reps for Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. That leaves Salesforce as the clearest bidder. The corporate pairing has caused a fair amount of hand wringing among tech analysts, Salesforce investors and Twitter fans. “Dear God, Please don’t let Salesforce buy Twitter. Amen,” one user posted on Twitter Thursday. Twitter’s cultural impact has arguably never been greater, as evidenced by its prominent role in the U.S. presidential election, but its viability as a standalone business has never seemed more precarious. Investors aren’t exactly hot on the acquisition either. Salesforce’s stock fell this week on concerns about a pricey deal for an unprofitable company with no growth. Under CEO Marc Benioff, Salesforce has made a number of acquisitions to provide additional software tools and data that help businesses and marketers manage relationships with customers. Twitter would almost certainly be the largest, with a price tag of at least $15 billion, or about a third of Salesforce’s market cap. Buying Twitter would give Salesforce access to valuable data on more than 300 million users, months after Salesforce lost out on its bid to buy LinkedIn. An acquisition would also give Salesforce control of a social platform that is already a powerful tool for brands to market themselves and field customer feedback. For Twitter, however, it’s unclear if having Salesforce as an owner solves any of its core problems. Unlike Disney, Salesforce isn’t particularly well suited to build up Twitter’s streaming entertainment and news offerings. Unlike Google or Apple, Salesforce may not have the technical chops to build innovative features and address harassment. And unlike any of these companies, Salesforce doesn’t have a track record of being profitable. “You can make the case for Salesforce to acquire them, but ultimately it boils down to how are they even going to pay for it, and are they the company that can extract the most value,” says James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. “I just don’t see it.” After Salesforce stock took a hit from the deal rumors, Benioff was careful to manage expectations about an acquisition. “The reality is we have to look at everything. We are going to pass on most things,” Benioff said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday. If Salesforce passes on buying Twitter, or simply can’t afford to make a bid compelling enough to persuade Twitter’s board, the social network may still find itself in a dire situation. “If that is the case, then I think Twitter will likely have to remain independent until a more reasonable valuation is available,” says Cakmak. Translation: If Twitter doesn’t sell after the latest flurry of rumors, its stock will continue to nosedive as investors lose hope of an easy exit. Once Twitter gets cheap enough, it’s possible suitors may take another stab at buying the company. Any significant stock decline would likely hit the morale of employees as Twitter leans heavily on stock-based compensation to retain talent. Many inside the company have either been looking for jobs elsewhere, or are waiting for their stock options to vest with the hope of a better financial return from an acquisition, according to interviews with former employees. Even if employees don’t flee at once, many could be pushed out. Twitter might be forced to cut costs to show investors it can improve profits if it can’t improve user numbers or sales growth. Twitter laid off 8% of its staff last year, but still has 3,860 employees globally, according to its website. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s cofounder, has struggled to reignite growth in the year since taking over as permanent CEO. In the absence of clear progress toward a turnaround, Twitter’s ailing stock has only shown signs of life for one reason this year: the acquisition rumors. It started with talk of News Corp. buying up Twitter in January and continued with chatter that venture capitalist Marc Andreessen or former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer might make a bid. No dice. Inevitably the stock would fall as investors realized there was no quick solution for Twitter’s woes. “The whole company always wished it had never gone public, to be honest,” the former Twitter employee says. Ryan Sarver, a former Twitter exec, echoed that sentiment in a tweet on Wednesday. “Hope [Twitter] goes to a good home. Still so much potential but needs to go private to be fixed.” 'Tis the season of VR, but it's not quite ready for the masses Zuckerberg lays out Oculus' long-term VR plans Related Posts Letterman’s last guests: Hanks, Murray but still no Leno GoFundMe campaign for Orlando shooting victims hits $2 million Taxing the rich won’t solve inequality Terrorism fears are bad news for airlines Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 10.06.16. 10.06.16 Time of Publication: 3:38 pm. 3:38 pm The Google Lab That’s Building a Legion of Diverse Coders Getty Images When the doors to Code Next opened in Oakland today, Errol King knew the hard work of launching a community computer lab was a prelude to a far greater challenge. Google launched the lab in one of the nation’s most diverse cities to introduce black and Latino students to coding and help reverse the tech sector’s persistent lack of diversity. King is the program’s “experience manager” (yes, that’s his real title), and part of Google’s team that joins schools and community organizations like Black Girls Code in identifying and cultivating potential computer scientists. “We decided from the beginning that we would build with the community, not for the community,” he says. This is key, because people like Oakland entrepreneur Freada Kapor Klein have a far better sense of the next generation of coders and engineers. “There is so much untapped genius,” she says, in the fourth most multicultural city in America. Oakland is 26 percent black and 25 percent Latino, making it far more diverse than the US. The challenge lies in tapping that pool. Demographic reports from Google, Apple, Facebook, and others confirm what many already suspected: white men comprise the bulk of the workforce. Blacks comprise about 7 percent and Latinos about 8 percent of the tech sector, in a nation where those numbers are 12 and 16 percent, respectively. Women comprise about 30 percent of tech, despite being 51 percent of the population. There are many reasons for these disparities, including the barriers to computer science education facing minorities. About half of all black and Latino students lack access to such classes, and students who don’t work with computers early on typically don’t pursue careers in that field. Companies like Google want to draw kids of all backgrounds into coding, because it’s the right thing to do and because it is essential to their future. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says the industry will have 1 million more computer science-related jobs than people to fill them by 2020. Opening the Doors to Code Next Google started a pilot program for Code Next at the beginning of the year, inviting about 70 ninth-graders into a lab not far from downtown Oakland. Students visited the lab twice a week from January through June to pursue projects ranging from coding and game development to 3D modeling. The company says 86 percent of the current class is black or Latino, and roughly evenly split among boys and girls. King says says the curriculum is “open-ended” and “iterative” to encourage exploration. “We wanted makers to find their way in large sandboxes,” he says. The space includes a computer science lab and engineering lab, but also a leadership lab where students are encouraged to talk about how their projects fit into a larger cultural conversation. As the curriculum evolves, Google hopes to, in the parlance of the tech sector, open-source it to educators everywhere. And although Code Next isn’t designed to lead kids straight into Google, King says, “I think it would be a good outcome if some of our makers and engineers make their way to Google.” Oakland Tech Tensions Google chose Oakland for its first lab because it wanted to work with a diverse community with a commitment to computer science education. (The company has a second lab slated to open next year in Harlem, New York.) Oakland possesses a strong sense of social justice, and its proximity to Silicon Valley gives it a strong understanding of tech culture, with groups like Hack the Hood, The Hidden Genius Project, and Black Girls Code working at the grassroots to diversify the industry. Still, some are skeptical of Google and its ability to collaborate with the community. “There’s definitely a spirit to this city that tech companies recognize and respect, but also have to learn to work with,” says Claire Shorall, manager of computer science for the Oakland Unified School District. The pushback makes sense. Anyone who is familiar with Oakland knows its history as a center of California counterculture, from the founding of the Black Panther Party in the sixties to Occupy Oakland in this decade. A culture of progressive protest still runs deep. Shorall concedes that tech companies have a presence in the education landscape, though companies like Intel and Salesforce tend to offer internships and grants. Google’s approach is, if nothing else, unique. “I think part of the reason why this is getting so much interest and attention is because there’s a physical location in Fruitvale,” she says, referring to the neighborhood where Google established the lab. “And Google’s a big name.” She understands why people might be skeptical—Code Next is still new, and people wonder about Google’s commitment and the impact it might have. But she doesn’t consider this skepticism a bad thing. “Community pushback signals that there’s engagement on both sides,” she says. Google has joined the community. Now the community must push it to be responsive to what those kids need to succeed in computer science. It is in their best interest. And Google’s. Go Back to Top.

The company has been working on this font for the past 5 years – in relative secret – with type company Monotype. The name Noto is short for No Tofu, and it’s aim is to effectively rid the world of those little blocks (as shown in our lead image) that appear when a device sees a character it doesn’t recognize. With Noto, no device will ever need show these blocks again. Google’s aim is to include every language and every written script in the history of the world into one typeface: Noto.* They’re doing this not just to be able to communicate effectively through digital means for all people, but to preserve all languages in our human history for generations to come. “When it comes to some of these lesser used languages, or even the purely academic or dead languages, we think it’s really important to preserve them,” said Bob Jung, director of internationalization for Google. “Without the digital capability of Noto, it’s much more difficult to preserve that cultural resource.” *NOTE: About the title – the word “font” speaks about a single set of letters which isn’t technically what Noto is. Instead, Noto is a typeface. A typeface is a collection of fonts that all work together. There’s a different font for each language, but they’re all part of the Noto typeface. The title we chose uses “font” because it’s more universally recognizable and doesn’t damage the news story or the end product in any significant way. So there. Below you’ll see a video with Jung and other representatives for this project from both Google and Monotype. *To be clear, Google is aiming to collect all languages used by humans in the real world – not necessarily those that have been made by humans for purposes like storybook characters and television shows. The question is included in Google’s Q&A section for Noto: When will Google support Klingon / Elvish / etc.? Per Google: “Once Klingon / Elvish / etc is included in Unicode :). Please contact the Unicode consortium to encourage them to support your favourite invented language.” The image below shows how each individual form in each character is scrutinized and, where applicable, re-used for other characters. According to Google and Monotype, their roles in this project are defined as such: • Monotype “has played two significant roles in the Noto project to date: researching and digitally designing the characters, writing systems and alphabets, and applying the rules and traditions for those individual languages to the fonts and managing the project, including organizing outside designers and linguists around the world who specialize in specific scripts.” • Google “defined the requirements and scope of the project, shared significant input into design direction for major languages, contributed design review and technical testing resources and expertise for a broad range of languages, and provided the funding that made this project possible.” Above you’ll see one of the many means used to translate disparate languages into a single unified typeface – hand drawing, sketching, forming. This is just one step – and a necessary one for the letter forms that might never have been converted to digital form at all before now. Below you’ll see one character form and notes on decisions that were made in its conversion to different forms. SG: Why has a font project of this scale never been done before? “The scale of the project is mainly why we think it’s never been done before,” said Steve Matteson, Monotype creative type director, and overseer of the Noto project. “Getting Google Noto to this point was a huge investment of time, research, design, engineering, expertise, approvals and of course cost. Not many companies have the ability to take on a typography task this expansive, but Monotype and Google brought together the right combination of resources to make it a reality.” SG: Is this typeface meant to be used as a major headliner – for design projects, as a primary font for apps – or is it meant to be a fallback for times when other fonts don’t have the necessary characters? “It really can be either,” said Matteson. “For devices, operating systems, applications, etc. that will be deployed worldwide, the full Google Noto font family will ensure that customers avoid tofu problems. However, designers and developers can download Noto fonts for individual languages and use them as needed to ensure coverage of desired languages.” Noto can be downloaded through Google Noto Fonts for free, for basically any use at all whatsoever, as covered under OFL – read the font’s update page for more information on copyright and the SIL OFL page for more on the OFL open font license. At the moment, Noto covers everything from Tibetan scripts to fonts from the Dead Sea Scrolls. This font will be used on the new Google Pixel devices and is already largely employed on Google devices of all sorts, including every Android and Chrome device worldwide. It’s already live!

Google is partnering with community-based organizations and experts in the field to develop culturally responsive learning experiences that meet the students where they are, in their communities. Google is reimagining the learning environment and opening neighborhood labs in Oakland and Harlem to help level the playing field and provide students with access and exposure to computer science. These dedicated community spaces will be the home of Code Next and a place for the entire community to meet and learn. Through student and community programs, they’ll learn what works, develop a cohort of CS leaders and create a playbook for communities everywhere to leverage Topper Carew and Errol King are co-collaborators at Code Next (Photo supplied by 135th St Agency)) Heading the Code Next, Fruitvale project is Errol King and Topper Carew, who worked together to develop the principle model for Code Next and the lab in Fruitvale. King is the experience manager at Code Next and was born and raised in the Bronx, New York. King started in communications and tech strategy for social justice movements. King was named a Tech Week Top 100 most influential people in New York for 2014. His partner in Code Next is Topper Carew, a visiting Researcher/Scholar at the MIT Media Lab. He has earned degrees in architecture and environmental design from Yale and has had fully supporting fellowships at MIT (Community Fellow) and from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (Broadcast Fellow). Carew founded an independent production company, Rainbow Television Workshop. It produced series and movies for PBS, HBO, Showtime, Nick and The Disney Channel. Other projects have aired in prime time on ABC, NBC, and FOX. His theatrically released films include DC Cab (Universal Pictures) and Breakin‘ and Enterin’ (Shapiro/Glickenhaus). One of his prime-time television series, “Martin” (FOX), enjoys the rarified distinction of having attained off-network syndication (TNT,TV One, and MTV). Rolling out spoke with King and Carew about Code Next and why the project is unique and important, not only in the Black and Latino community but also for America as a whole. Why did you choose the name Code Next? We thought about what would you want to  ‘code next.” In this case the next generation of tech leaders. The name code resonates with those people who understand  what it means and where its coming from, but the velocity of the word ‘next’ implies the future state of things and these young folk are the next big thing. Why did you choose the Fruitvale area? Why Oakland? We looked at where the tech eco-systems reside in the Black and Latino community. Oakland and Fruitvale area are historically Black.  We saw an opportunity to move and connect with the Black and Latino community and we built “spaces” where they are. Code Next is really about where Black and Latino culture come together with the intent of building “technical social capital” right in the heart of our own community. We bring multiple youth, family and community organizations together as well as local schools. There are a lot of supporting local organizations Oakland is the next place to bring forth the next generation of awe-inspiring technology. Code Next students at work (Photo supplied by 135th St Agency)) What impact do you hope this center will have on the development of STEM skills for kids? We have a very strong commitment to underserved populations. We think that the young people that go through this particular program will be a future generation of computer scientists, innovators, inventors and tech leaders. It’s not just about STEM it’s also about teaching them how to be computational thinkers; how to be strategic thinkers and computer scientists. This means how to be leaders of the future in the technology industry. To be entrepreneurs who are going to create jobs and economic opportunities. People who are ultimately going to improve the quality of life through technology in those communities where we live. Communities where e have an array of problems that could be solved and supported through technology. What are your roles at Code Next? We have known each other a long time we are like brothers and are co-collaborators. We work with each other on daily basis and develop curriculum based on the MIT pedagogy of knowledge and learning. We collaboratively create things and make them real. Why Do you think STEM skills were neglected in the Black and Latino community? Historically, we have been great consumers and early adopters of  new technologies. However, there is a mindset on the part of so many of our young people that causes them to believe that we do not belong in the “space” that invents. The space that manages, innovates and that is relative to the future; to the very industry of technology itself. So we had a mind switch. One of the great things about Code Next is that we recognize and believe that the Black and Latino communities are untapped  reservoirs of intellect and talent and when young people get equal access to the stellar educational opportunities they will ascend to become a vital resource for America’s technological productivity and competitiveness. We are seeing this. We are seeing what happens when a person begins designing code and  using tech tools. Code Next students at work (Photo supplied by 135th St Agency)) We are seeing these young people open up and blossom. Technology is like early stages of the NBA when the players were white. But when we look at the NBA now that has changed. We are at a stage where we are going to blossom and see a multiplicity of our young people enter, engage and turn the tide of technology in an culturally audacious way. Code Next is the first curriculum of codified learning activities ever for underserved youth. It’s the first because it simultaneously interweaves a making and doing computer science, engineering and mathematic principles into a laboratory experience where young people are encouraged to experiment and learn from their experience. Code Next is so much more than just Google opening a lab. It’s a true first. From a design point of view it is a truly unique experience that very much leans on an educational theory known as constructionism. This codified curriculum will soon be available to the entire world as an open source.

The Northern California District Court has certified [PDF] the case brought against the Chocolate Factory, allowing aggrieved applicants aged 40 and older to join together in filing a single suit. By certifying the case, the court allows the plaintiffs to take on Google's legal might as a combined force, rather than individually. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of a favorable settlement from Cali-based Google. The complaint, originally filed in April of 2015, claims that Google discriminates against job candidates over the age of 40 when screening them. The suit accuses Google of violating the US Age Discrimination in Employment Act. "Plaintiffs allege that Google has engaged in a systematic pattern and practice of discriminating against individuals (including Plaintiffs) who are age 40 and older in hiring, compensation, and other employment decisions with the resultant effect that persons age 40 or older are systematically excluded from positions for which they are well-qualified," the complaint reads. One of the named plaintiffs, Cheryl Fillekes, claims to have interviewed with Google four times between 2007 and 2014 for positions, but was turned down each time after in-person interviews in part because of her age. She noted that on one occasion, Google recruiters asked that graduation dates be included on her resume as a way to check her age. The certification is, however, far from a finding of guilt on Google's part. In granting the class action, Judge Beth Freeman noted in her ruling that with the lower standard of evidence needed for a class action, "the Court may consider evidence that may not be admissible at trial." Allegations of age discrimination are by no means unique to Google. Older workers in Silicon Valley have long bemoaned a culture that prioritizes youth over experience when awarding jobs and venture capital funding. Fellow tech giant HP (and both of its offshoots) was recently hit with a suit accusing it of pushing older workers onto the chopping block when deciding job cuts. A Google spokesperson told The Register: "We believe the allegations here are without merit and we will continue to defend our position vigorously. We have strong policies against discrimination on any unlawful basis, including age." ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 46 Comments More from The Register Infosec lady flings sueball at Microsoft over 'gender discrimination' Female techies receive less pay and fewer promotions, says class action claim 31 Comments Use of big data can lead to 'harmful exclusion, discrimination' – FTC Data model should take account of biases 15 Comments Italy's 'Google tax law' could fall foul of EU discrimination rules Billion-euro attempt to get more taxes out of web firms may be illegal 32 Comments Google snags patent on price discrimination A sucker found in every cookie 64 Comments Both HPs allegedly axed people just for being old, California court told Class-action lawsuit accuses IT giants of age discrimination in layoffs 42 Comments US Labor Dept accuses CIA-backed Palantir of discriminating against Asian engineers Good ol' boys' club gives jobs to good ol' boys, lawsuit says 27 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

(KOIN) – A bandage embedded with tiny monitors that lets medical workers determine when it needs to be changed earned its inventor a $15,000 scholarship from the Google international science contest. The inventor is an 8th-grader from Stoller Middle School. Anushka Naiknaware of Beaverton finished in the top 5 in the contest. Her project, “Fractal inspired Chitosan and Carbon Nanoparticle Based Biocompatible Sensor for Wound Management,” wowed the Google judges. Anushka Naiknaware, an 8th-grader at Stoller Middle School in Beaverton, holds the bandage she invented that tells doctors when it needs to be changed, October 6, 2016 (KOIN) More about the Google Science Fair Large wounds must be kept moist to promote healing, but changing bandages too often to check moisture levels can make things worse. A chronic wound is one that has a hard time healing because of another pre-existing condition, like diabetes. “No one has done anything about it. I mean, it’s completely ignored.” Then she added, “What this problem needs is what carbon nanoparticles have.” Anushka Naiknaware, an 8th-grader at Stoller Middle School in Beaverton, points to an app for a bandage she invented that tells doctors when it needs to be changed, October 6, 2016 (KOIN) If a wound is too dry, she said, it doesn’t have the essential bacteria needed to heal properly. But if it’s too moist, there’s a greater risk of infection. Since nurses change wound dressings on a regular basis — and do it visually — that upsets the moisture balance in chronic wounds. Her bandage reports the moisture level in the wound dressing and lets doctors figure out when to change them. “Basically,” Anushka said, “my project was designing a moisture sensor that was bio-compatible and made out of conductive ink but also very cheap to manufacture and something that would connect to, like, a phone.” She really believes this will make a difference in people’s lives by reducing infection and stress. Her inspirations She loves science. “It’s like humanity’s quest to understand the world around us and kind of like hoping for order, which I think everything relies on,” she told KOIN 6 News. In her online bio, she said her “interests in science and engineering have been piqued by my frequent visits to OMSI (Oregon Museum of Science and Industry). I would spend hours on end in the chemistry lab, not satisfied till I had done every experiment there!” Her top 2 inspirations, she said, are her 6th grade teacher and Marie Curie, whose work helped advance modern medicine. Though she’s only in 8th grade, she plans to “get into a top graduate school such as Harvard, MIT or Stanford.” And, like her inspiration Marie Curie, wants to win a Nobel Prize in science. “That’s my ultimate goal.” Anushka thought her idea might work. “But that moment when you finally realize, wait, I’m a 13-year-old and I finally made something that can change the entire world — that was definitely, like, the best moment for me.” In addition to the scholarship, she won a  free trip to Lego world headquarters in Demark and a year of mentoring from a Lego executive. But there was one question she couldn’t answer. Asked to choose between math and science as her favorite subject, she couldn’t. “They take top place. They’re tied.” Anushka Naiknaware, an 8th-grader at Stoller Middle School in Beaverton, invented a bandage that tells doctors when it needs to be changed, October 6, 2016 (KOIN) Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Nexus 9 LTE to receive Android Nougat with September security patch By R Padla - October 6, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Nexus line is gone for good. Don’t expect Google to revive it because it’s been replaced by the Pixel. Hopefully, the Pixel devices (Pixels?) will be patronized by more people this time as the “first” set of Google-branded phones. Because there’s no more Nexus series, we doubt if the rumored Nexus tablet will still be announced. Probably with a different name but before that happens, let’s focus on the Nexus 9 LTE. If you own a Nexus 9 LTE, you’d be happy to know that your tablet is eligible for Android 7.0 Nougat. This isn’t a ROM or a hack but an official update complete with the September security patch. We’re expecting this one since Google announced the Nougat updates for both the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 LTE. The Nexus 6 got the update a few days ago but with the October security patch already. Now it’s the Nexus 9 LTE’s turn. Note that this is for the LTE variant and not the WiFi version. That one may soon arrive but we don’t know when exactly. An OTA update notification should be received soon. If you see the NRD90R build number, then it means you are already updated to the latest version. You can also get the OTA image download page. Unfortunately, there’s no factory image ready for download yet.

Comments By Derek Walter Follow Greenbot | Oct 6, 2016 12:00 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Android Google Pixel Comments With a name like Pixel, you expect a great camera. Google says it’s delivered that with its new smartphones, going over in meticulous detail all of the capabilities and wowing the crowd with a selection of portraits, night scenes, and action shots at the San Francisco unveiling. The kicker was trotting out a score of 89 from DxOMark, the highest ever from what’s considered a very reliable camera testing site. That’s one point ahead of the Galaxy S7 Edge, HTC 10, and Sony Xperia X Performance while a full three points ahead of the iPhone 7 (the 7 Plus hasn’t been scored yet). DxOMark DxOMark put the Pixel through the ringer and crowned it the best smartphone camera ever. So what makes it that much better? After some hands on time and staring way too long at sample images taken with a Pixel, I’ve landed on five core reasons why Google really did knock it out of the park when it comes to building a smartphone camera that you’re going to really want. Low light performance This isn’t the first time that Google has patted itself on the back for a phone that can deliver in the dark, as this was a major claim to fame for the Nexus 6P as well. But this time the results are even more impressive, as illustrated by the following photo, taken with a Pixel. DxOMark Low-light performance is one of the benchmark features of the Pixel phone. The 12.3 megapixel camera has an f/2.0 aperture, which isn’t technically as good as the Galaxy S7 and Note7 (f1.7) but it sure seems to do an outstanding job. The Pixel handles the following picture well, which has a mix of different lighting. The photo still has a lot of detail and handles the plants and fencing area in the shadows very well. DxOMark In this complex scene the Pixel is able to render good color quality and show details even in the shadows. In terms of the full suite of specs, the Pixel camera offers the following, straight from the Google Store: Google Store The Google Pixel has a solid set of specs for the phone's camera. Some may be disappointed that Google didn’t go for the 2X physical zoom capability of the iPhone 7 Plus or left out more advanced features in the camera software itself, like a manual mode to specify shutter speed. The camera app looked very much like the Nexus version, without the advanced features for tweaking the photo that I’m used to on the S7 Edge. If Google wants to truly set itself apart as the king of mobile photography, this is where it needs to go next. Excellent detail I’m by no means a professional photographer (or even a great amateur one) but I genuinely thought the detail of the many images we got to see was very impressive.  DxOMark The detail in the bridge is pretty incredible, as you can see the colors very clearly and specific features of the fence. DxOMark even had this to say about how well the Pixel does with detail: “The Pixel does better in outdoor scenes at preserving detail than any smartphone we’ve ever tested.” It’s a big compliment from a site that’s become the benchmark at rating and ranking camera performance of smartphones. Outdoor pictures can be achieved with great performance from many phones on both sides of the operating system divide. If you take most of your pictures outdoors, however, this is another perk that may make the Pixel the right choice. Fast picture taking I got a good amount of hands-on time with the Pixel in Google’s demo area. Google even brought in a professional photographer who had extensively used the phone and said he felt it was the best one he’d ever tried (but of course, he wouldn’t be there otherwise). But I was genuinely impressed at the speed of the shutter and my ability to rapidly switch to video mode, to the gallery, fiddle with the settings, and back to the viewfinder. Derek Walter There’s a reason the camera icon is right there in the dock. Google put a lot of emphasis on camera performance with its Pixel smartphone. Anyone who’s had a Nexus 6P knows that the shutter lag and shot-to-shot speed can be a serious issue. I’ve even encountered this at times on my Galaxy S7 Edge, which is (to this point) the best camera phone I’ve owned. A full test of firing up the camera time and time again over a couple of weeks is needed before a full verdict can be rendered, but I really liked much better the Pixel camera worked. Video stabilization Google had a lot to say about this, offering a demo video of how superior its video stabilization is to competing products.  Again, this was hard to test in the small and controlled environment we were squished into at San Francisco’s Ghirardelli Square. But from the demo video you see the movie goes from practically unusable to buttery smooth. That's obviously a best-case scenario, and you're unlikely to get such perfect results. The Pixel is capable of capturing 4K video at 30 frames per second, 1080p video at 120fps and 720p at 240fps. These features are dying for a real-world test, so we’ll be standing outside the office once we get word that Pixel phones are on their way for us to review. I was able to take a Pixel and quickly walk around the room and try out the stabilization feature, but I did notice a tangible difference. But I’d need some more time to really render a verdict. While the Pixel doesn't have optical image stabilization as so many other premium phones do, it's own new custom electronic stabilization might actually be good enough to make us forget about the missing feature. Natural colors The following picture is one of those cheesy images that you often see with product demos. But to me it was one of the most impressive for how natural the skin tones and colors look in all of the different elements of the picture. Google This photo of two women outside a bright, red house struck me as a great showcase for the Pixel's camera capabilities. From a purely anecdotal perspective, this was one of the many moments where I truly wanted a Pixel and felt it could be an outstanding primary camera. I travel frequently and like to capture a lot of family moments with my phone since I’ve never been a dedicated enough photographer to pick up a DSLR. Could the Pixel be this great? I can’t say for sure after just an hour in a demo room, but I think we may be in for a pleasant surprise.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Rolling Update: The automobile is the next great app platform Rolling Update: The automobile is the next great app platform By Ben Algaze on October 6, 2016 at 2:02 pm Comment There’s no question information technology has invaded the automobile in a big way. Our once-state-of-the-art choices, as little as a decade ago, consisted of Bluetooth for our cell phones, a CD player, satellite radio for audio, and perhaps a rear-seat DVD playback system (here’s an example the current state of the art). Today our car infotainment systems may have cellular data connectivity, Wi-Fi hotspots for multiple devices, apps for various audio content sources, and apps to connect to navigation or otherwise enhance the “mobility experience.” We can thank the rapid evolution of the smartphone that has brought the underlying software and hardware technology to the mainstream, and also for stoking consumer demand to have the same connectivity choices in their cars as they have in their pockets. But while the technology in the car is similar, it’s not quite the same. Auto infotainment systems must interface with a variety of proprietary and industry standard protocols that have existed for years. There are some basic software layers: operating systems (tailored for automobiles), auto specific middleware, HMI (Human Machine Interface) middleware, and layers you might expect for auto applications and the all-important integration with smartphones. Source: IHS Markit Part of this shows the increasing complexity of the modern infotainment system. The chart above doesn’t really account for the complex architecture of adding autonomous driving, safety, and infrastructure aware applications that are being developed. Automakers are rapidly ramping up their software skills as the importance of the in-car infotainment experience becomes clearer. In a recent report by consulting firm PWC, 56% of new car buyers said they would switch to a different brand if the one they were considering didn’t offer the technology and features they wanted. Similarly, 48% of car buyers said they would walk away from a vehicle they liked if the technology was difficult to use. Clearly, connected applications and technology are becoming a much more important consideration in which vehicles consumers choose and buy. Infotainment systems are also figuring heavily into consumer perceptions of automotive quality. Ford’s well publicized problems with previous versions of Sync resulted in low ratings from Consumer Reports and JD Power quality surveys. The encroachment of computing technology in infotainment came on the scene years before the iPhone and Android smartphone revolution. Microsoft’s original embedded automotive solutions based on Windows CE, and later embedded Windows XP, made headway in infotainment over 10 years ago. Perhaps the biggest win for Microsoft was in powering the original (and maligned) Ford Sync. Ford’s current Sync 3 is now based on QNX. QNX, now part of Blackberry, has long been in the embedded space, and reportedly commands over 50% of the infotainment OS market. Operating systems based on open source Linux make up the rest, and industry consortiums like Genivi aim to develop Linux-based software stacks to standardize parts of the infotainment platform to accelerate innovation. It is the smartphone, its connectivity, and its wide range of application choices that is driving much of the innovation in infotainment systems today. Consumers want the same ease of use and choice of the smartphone in a way that is safe to use in cars. In that respect, automakers have responded by adopting smartphone interface technology in cars, sometimes with mixed results. Systems with touchscreens like Ford’s Sync and Cadillac’s Cue have been criticized for slow response and laggy input. In some instances, where automakers sought to replace hard buttons with touchscreen interfaces, they discovered usability suffered and went back to redundant physical controls for oft-used features like climate and audio control. Pinch to zoom is great on a smartphone, but it requires far more concentration in a moving car than when you are using a smartphone (and hopefully not using said smartphone while you’re driving). Scrolling through menus using touch – even when the performance is acceptable – is still not a great experience while driving. Automakers have continued to innovate on HMI, with gesture control, handwriting recognition on touchpads, and enhanced voice control all vying to deliver a better in-car experience. With the dominance of Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, consumers are increasingly demanding the same familiar interface and app choices while they are moving. Automakers have responded by having their own miniature app ecosystems via partnerships with app developers and internet content services. Examples abound from all the automakers in recent years; Google search and maps integration for Audi and BMW systems, Garmin navigation and Yelp for Chrysler’s Uconnect system, Pandora streaming on a large number of automaker systems. Some rely on smartphone integration, and some have integrated connectivity (for example LTE on a variety of GM models) where apps can function on their own. Apple and Google’s smartphone dominance have practically forced automakers to offer support for CarPlay and Android Auto. In many cases, neither system (at least today) delivers functionality that isn’t offered on existing infotainment systems. Load up CarPlay in a new car, for example, and you get Apple Maps, messages, music, Siri, and a handful of compatible apps like Pandora. All of these functions have already been offered (sans Siri, but sometimes offered via live concierge services like OnStar) in existing infotainment systems. It does offer a familiar, if dumbed-down and simplified — but easier to use — experience that requires almost no knowledge ramp. The ultimate promise of CarPlay and Android Auto is to bring the rich app ecosystem of the smartphone platforms to the car. For automakers that didn’t originally employ touchscreen infotainment interfaces (notable German luxury brands like Audi, BMW, and Mercedes) they present a technical challenge to incorporate as well. The standardization of the infotainment interface can be a threat to automakers by taking away some of the differentiation in the in-car experience. On the other hand, it may be an opportunity as well. For example, automaker voice recognition/AI technology is no match for the sophistication of Apple’s Siri and Google Now/Assistant, or Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft Cortana for that matter. The opening up of these voice platforms will present new opportunities for automakers to offer applications that integrate the car (and its data) better with your personal information, likes, desires, home automation, and a host of other uses I’m not creative enough to foresee. While apps may ultimately dominate the interface and experience, part of the business model for both the technology companies and the automakers may be who controls the data. As Google and Facebook have built huge and highly profitable businesses from the consumer data they collect, automobiles are and will continue to be great generators of valuable data. Apple’s secretive and much-rumored car project reportedly held discussions with Daimler and BMW that fell apart over control of the data from the car. The automakers are wary, not only of ceding some control of the experience to the technology companies, but also of giving up future business opportunities with all the data that will be collected. The battle over the in-car interface will become more important as self driving capabilities become reality. When “driving becomes the distraction,” the ecosystem of apps and services become the mobility experience. The experience will not be about driving, but preparing for the activity ahead, learning more about where you’re going, or perhaps researching things of interest you otherwise might not have time for. This is where the ecosystem companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have inherent advantages with important technology positions across widely used information and entertainment services. You can’t count out other providers – too many to list – like Facebook, AT&T, Verizon, and others that will want a stake in the system. Automakers will have their work cut out for them to maintain their brand identity and customer image in an increasingly information-centric mobility experience.

DoD photo by Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Tim D. Godbee Board members already have spent time with airmen at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, sailors aboard ships docked in San Diego, California, soldiers and special operators at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, at U.S. Central Command and Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida, at U.S. Cyber Command in Maryland and other DoD installations. “As a result of this initial fact-finding,” Carter said, “and based on the knowledge and experience each of you brings to the table from your private-sector lives … members of the board have made some preliminary observations and interim recommendations about certain innovative practices from outside DoD that might be useful to us.” Carter established the board in March, inviting as members 15 innovators from the private sector and academia to enhance the department’s culture, organization and processes. The DIB chairman is Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent company Alphabet. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter speaks with members of the Defense Innovation Board during the board’s first public meeting Oct. 5, 2016, at the Pentagon in Washington. DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Brigitte N. Brantley Other board members are LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, University of Texas Chancellor and former Special Operations Command Commander Navy Adm. William McRaven, Aspen Institute President and Chief Executive Walter Isaacson, Amazon founder and Chief Executive Jeffrey Bezos, and Code for America’s Founder and Executive Director Jennifer Pahlka. Then there’s Google Capital’s Vice President for Access Services Milo Medin, Instagram Chief Operating Officer Marne Levine, United Technologies Senior Vice President for Science and Technology J. Michael McQuade, Wharton School of Business Professor Adam Grant, California Institute of Technology Dynamical Systems Professor and Bioengineer Richard Murray, Harvard’s Robert Walmsley University Professor Cass Sunstein, computer theorist and co-founder of Applied Invention Danny Hillis, Broad Institute President and Founding Director Eric Lander, and Hayden Planetarium Director and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. “I couldn’t have asked for a group better qualified for this mission,” Carter said during his remarks. “I’m grateful to these citizen-leader-innovators for taking the time from their busy schedules to do this. I don’t take it for granted for your selfless willingness to contribute to the defense of our nation and make a better world for our children,” he said. Interim Recommendations Here are some of the interim recommendations included the following: – Appoint a DoD chief innovation officer to coordinate, oversee and synchronize innovation activities across the department. – Establish a career track for computer science and a digital Reserve Officer’s Training Corps program. – Build a culture of evidence-based, outcome-driven policies and experimentation by, among other things, offering bonuses, recognition, awards and other incentives for managers who promote innovation, give employees greater voice and encourage creativity and divergent views. – Direct Cybercom, working in coordination with the National Security Agency, to conduct a security review of every DoD system. – Establish an institute for studying artificial intelligence and machine learning. – Increase the speed and timeliness of acquisition processes by increasing the use of mechanisms for waivers and exemptions and offering incentives for quickly resolving concerns. – Increase investment in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Strategic Capabilities Office, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, rapid equipping units and other small, agile, innovative organizations and create more connections among them. – Establish a computer science resource — a “human cloud” of computer programmers and software developers who are available on demand to swiftly solve software problems. In his remarks, Schmidt said that the board was in its “user research phase.” “We’ve been on submarines and watch floors and op centers and laboratories and flight lines,” he added, because it’s interesting to the members and because there’s nothing like understanding what people do and how they do it when making recommendations for change. Over the next months, Schmidt explained, the board will visit more military facilities and develop a valid set of recommendations, then over 2017 will monitor actions taken across the department on the recommendations.

Resend activation e-mail Technology Lab / Information Technology FCC proposes broadband privacy rules despite opposition from ISPs Pay-for-privacy plans won't be banned, but ISPs face new opt-in requirements. by Jon Brodkin - Oct 6, 2016 6:52 pm UTC Login to bookmark 73 Getty Images | Yuri_Arcurs The Federal Communications Commission plans to vote on rules protecting the privacy of broadband subscribers later this month despite persistent opposition from Internet service providers. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler circulated the proposal to commissioners today and scheduled a vote for October 27. The rules are likely to be approved by a 3-2 vote with the commission’s Democratic majority supporting them. The proposed rules will put broadband providers under a stricter privacy regime than the one imposed on websites like Google and Facebook, which are regulated separately by the Federal Trade Commission. The rules will require ISPs to get opt-in consent from consumers before sharing Web browsing data and other private information with advertisers and other third parties. ISPs like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Charter argued that they shouldn’t face stricter rules than websites. Google—whose advertising business could benefit from deals with ISPs—also argued that the FCC rules for Internet providers should mirror the FTC’s rules for websites. The company believes opt-in consent should only be required for the most sensitive data, like health and financial information. Wheeler argues that ISPs deserve greater scrutiny than makers of websites or applications. ISPs are “collecting information about us every time we go online,” Wheeler wrote today. “Your ISP handles all of your network traffic. That means it has a broad view of all of your unencrypted online activity—when you are online, the websites you visit, and the apps you use. If you have a mobile device, your provider can track your physical location throughout the day in real time. Even when data is encrypted, your broadband provider can piece together significant amounts of information about you—including private information such as a chronic medical condition or financial problems—based on your online activity.” The FCC’s proposed rules would apply only to fixed and mobile broadband providers and would not cover the privacy practices of websites and applications like Twitter and Facebook. If the rules are approved, ISPs would have to obtain opt-in consent from consumers before using and sharing sensitive information such as geo-location, children’s information, health information, financial information, Social Security numbers, Web browsing history, app usage history, and the content of communications. ISPs would also have to let customers opt out of the use and sharing of other types of information, such as what service tier a customer subscribes to. ISPs would not be allowed to refuse service to customers who don’t consent to the sharing of their information for commercial purposes, such as advertising. Pay-for-privacy plans allowed, with disclosures The FCC is not banning “pay-for-privacy” offerings in which ISPs charge more when customers don’t opt in to information sharing. But “the rules would require heightened disclosure for plans that provide discounts or other incentives in exchange for a consumer’s express affirmative consent to the use and sharing of their personal information,” the FCC said. The FCC said it will also review pay-for-privacy plans on a case-by case basis. The proposal fact sheet says that “Consumers should not be forced to choose between paying inflated prices and maintaining their privacy,” even though it’s clear that ISPs will be allowed to provide discounts in exchange for consent to use customers’ information for marketing purposes. An FCC official said that the case-by-case review process will be used to weed out programs that amount to a requirement that consumers opt in. AT&T’s Internet Preferences was the most prominent pay-for-privacy plan. Under that program, AT&T analyzed customers' Web browsing habits in order to deliver personalized ads to the websites they visit or marketing via e-mail and postal mail. AT&T decided to end the program this month, perhaps to avoid greater scrutiny. The FCC proposal also includes new notification and data security rules, such as the following: ISPs must notify customers about what types of information they collect, specify how ISPs use and share the information, and identify the types of entities they share the data with. ISPs that want to use and share anonymized data without consent must take steps to ensure that the data cannot be linked to specific individuals or devices. ISPs must notify customers about data breaches within 30 days and notify the FCC within seven days. The FCC noted that its rules will not regulate other services offered by broadband providers, including social media websites, and the rules “do not address issues such as government surveillance, encryption or law enforcement.” The privacy proposal stems from the FCC’s decision last year to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers, which allowed the FCC to impose strict net neutrality rules but removed ISPs from the jurisdiction of the FTC, which cannot regulate common carriers. The FCC’s existing privacy rules cover telephone service but not broadband, so the commission had to draw up new ones to account for the differences between telephone service and Internet access. Consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge urged the FCC to accept Wheeler’s proposal despite opposition from ISPs. “The proposed rules will, for the first time, require broadband providers to actually ask consumers for permission before exploiting sensitive private information and tracking them online,” Public Knowledge Senior VP Harold Feld said. “But even this simple ‘ask first’ rule has met fierce resistance from the broadband industry. Broadband carriers demand the right to make billions of dollars selling our most sensitive private information as well.” USTelecom, which represents ISPs including AT&T and Verizon, criticized Wheeler's proposal today. "Consumers are best served when privacy rules are clear and consistent across the entire Internet," USTelecom President Walter McCormick said in a statement. "We are concerned... that the commission, which has no expertise with regard to determining the content of speech, is now attempting to redefine what consumers may regard as sensitive. In this regard, consumers would be better served if the FCC were to defer to the expertise of the FTC in this area, and the two agencies were to pursue a uniform approach.” Expand full story Reader comments 73 You must login or create an account to comment.

Print Email Troy Dreier/For the Jersey Journal By Troy Dreier/For the Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal on October 06, 2016 at 2:35 PM comments Amazon versus Google: Now we've got a battle. Voice activated products will be the next great area for tech. We first got a taste of this when Amazon introduced the Echo, a $180 device that you speak to with natural language commands. Using the Alexa voice interface, you can ask to hear a song, a weather report, or even a joke. It couldn't be simpler. While that's fun, the real value emerges when you connect other wireless home devices. Then you can turn on the lights, control the thermostat, or set the home alarm with voice commands. The list of supported devices will keep growing. This week, Google introduced its challenger to the Echo: Google Home. Selling for $129 and coming in different colors, Google Home is ideal for people who already depend on Google's apps (it can update your calendar, for example) and Chromecast TV device (soon, it will let you play Netflix shows using voice commands). Google Home will work with devices from Nest, Phillips, and Samsung. It's available for purchase now and will ship November 4. While I haven't tried the Google Home yet, I spent the week testing the Amazon Tap ($99), a lower-priced Alexa device. While you can talk to the Echo anytime you want (staring your commands with "Alexa," so it knows to pay attention), you need to tap the microphone button on the Tap before saying anything. The benefit of the Tap is that it's portable. Once it's charged, you can take it anywhere you want. While I was afraid having to touch the device before speaking a command would be a chore, it's not that inconvenient. And I love being able to take the Tap from room to room. It's small and easy to take along. Amazon has a lead in the home automation market, but Google will certainly come on strong. With the Google Home much cheaper, it's a battle to watch this holiday shopping season.  Follow TROY DREIER at http://twitter.com/TDreier or e-mail him at loggedon@mac.com.    Most Read Active Discussions nj.com About Us About NJ.com Advertise with us Contact Us Visit OMJ.com Frequently Asked Questions Jobs at NJ Advance Media Newsletters RSS feeds More on NJ.com Interact Weather Site map Claim your free business listing Sponsor Content Search Place an ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Post a job Post a free classified ad Apartments & rentals NJ.com Sections N.J.

The first Google Tango-based smartphone will reportedly arrive next month. Google's Clay Bavor confirmed to CNET on Thursday that the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro will launch in November. The smartphone will be the first to tap into Google Tango, which features advanced camera technology that can sense items in a room, digitally "see" those items, and navigate indoors. Google Tango has for years been a prototype technology that seemed to have far more promise than applicability. However, in the last year, augmented reality, which can overlay virtual objects in the real world, has taken shape with popular games like Pokemon Go. Google Tango takes that a step further by delivering more sophisticated features in smartphones. See ours hands on from MWC in Barcelona, where we used a Tango device to tour the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. That said, Tango has been slow going and hurt by delays. Google initially hoped Lenovo would be able to launch its Tango device in the summer, but it was delayed to September. Soon after, Lenovo said that the smartphone would ship in the fall, without giving an exact date. //Related Articles Phab2 Pro Hands On: Lenovo's First Project Tango Smartphone Even now, saying the Phab 2 Pro will launch in November isn't all that forthright. Bavor could not confirm an exact launch date to CNET. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro will go up against a number of other buzz-worthy devices, including Google's new Pixel handsets. The Phab 2 Pro is slated to ship with a 6.4-inch quad-HD screen, a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a giant 4,050mAh battery. It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, which is a little underpowered but still optimized for Tango. It's expected to retail for $499 unlocked. Lenovo did not respond to a PCMag request for comment.

By Conner Forrest | October 6, 2016, 10:06 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: James Martin/CNET The launch of the Google Pixel phone marked a decided shift in the company's mobile strategy. Gone are the days of the co-branded Nexus devices produced by companies like LG, Huawei, and Samsung—instead, Google now owns all the branding as well as the entire design and product cycle (even though the Pixel phone was actually manufactured by HTC). The Pixel paves the way for the kinds of tightly-integrated, AI-powered hardware that the company wants to deliver. To help would-be buyers, business leaders, and IT professionals better understand the features of the Pixel phone and its place in the overall smartphone market, we've put together the most important details and resources in this smart person's guide. This is a "living" article that will be updated and refreshed as new, relevant information becomes public. SEE: All of TechRepublic's smart person's guides Executive summary (TL;DR) What it is: Google's Pixel Phone is the first smartphone to feature its AI-powered Google Assistant, and the first phone declared Daydream-ready for Google's VR platform. It comes in two versions: the 5-inch Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL Why it matters: The Google Pixel phone is a new direction for Google, as it controlled more of the design process, and it offers some unique features and specs that could make it a top contender among flagship smartphones. Who does this affect: Consumers heavily invested in the Google ecosystem should consider the possibility of purchasing this phone, while IT leaders must account for how its presence could affect their organization. When is this happening: Google first began releasing smartphones as part of its Nexus line in 2010. The Pixel phone was officially announced on October 4, 2016. How to take advantage of Google Pixel phone: The Pixel phone is available for pre-order and is scheduled to arrive in stores on October 20, 2016. What it is In January 2010, Google released the first Nexus phone as a partnership with HTC. Being that Android, Google's mobile operating system (OS), is open source, OEMs and other manufacturers had a field day adding (often unnecessary) modifications and features—often maligned as bloatware. The Nexus program came about as a way to offer a clean version of Android, as Google intended it—sometimes called "pure Android." Over the years, Google released a slew of Nexus devices—including smartphones, tablets, and even Android TV products. Since these came straight from Google, they were often the first to receive important OS and security updates, and often bypassed any carrier or vendor delays in certifying the software. In October 2016, Google announced the Pixel phone, as a departure from the Nexus branding. The phone was developed in Google's hardware group, led by Rick Osterloh. The key component of the Pixel phone is Google Assitant, an AI assistant that has grown out of Google Now and is exclusive to the Pixel to start. It also includes a fast charging feature that will give users seven hours of battery life after only 15 minutes of charging. The phone is available in two versions: the 5-inch Pixel, and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Here the features and specifications for both models. Pixel (5") Resolution: 1920 x 1080 pixels Pixel density: 441 ppi Dimensions (inches): 5.66 x 2.74 x 0.34 Dimensions (millimeters): 143.84 x 69.54 x 8.58 Weight: 5.04 oz, or 143 grams OS: Android 7.1 Nougat Rear camera: 12.3 MP Front camera: 8 MP Video: 4K capture available Processor: 2.15GHz + 1.6GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Storage: 32GB or 128GB RAM: 4GB Expandable storage: N/A Battery: 2770mAh Fingerprint sensor: Back cover Connector: USB-C Price: $649 (32GB); $749 (128GB) Pixel XL (5.5") Resolution: 2560 x 1440 pixels Pixel density: 4534 ppi Dimensions (inches): 6.09 x 2.98 x 0.34 Dimensions (millimeters): 154.72 x 75.74 x 8.58 Weight: 5.92 oz, or 168 grams OS: Android 7.1 Nougat Rear camera: 12.3 MP Front camera: 8 MP Video: 4K capture available Processor: 2.15GHz + 1.6GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Storage: 32GB or 128GB RAM: 4GB Expandable storage: N/A Battery: 3450mAh Fingerprint sensor: Back cover Connector: USB-C Price: $769 (32GB); $869 (128GB) Both phone sizes are available in three colors: Very Silver, Quite Black, and a limited edition color called Really Blue, which was only available with 32GB of storage. However, the Really Blue model sold out a few minutes after the initial announcement.

(CNET) Google Pixel smartphones: Hardware specifications (ZDNet) The blue Pixel and Pixel XL are really, really sold out (CNET) Why it matters The first thing to note about the Pixel phone is its name—Google has officially dropped its flagship Nexus branding. That's important because, in dropping the co-branding of its pure Android devices, Google is making a statement that it is ready to approach mobile in its own way, and that path is lit by artificial intelligence (AI). More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter In Google's case, AI means its intelligent Google Assitant, first debuted at the 2016 Google I/O developer conference. Google is well aware that any advances in technologies around intelligent chat and the connected home will be centered around the smartphone. So, by creating a device that has AI-powered hardware, Google is creating a daily tool that could help empower more contextual AI services, but also will bolster its effort with Google Home and its chat app, Allo. In addition to its dedication to AI, Pixel is also the linchpin for Google's efforts in virtual reality. At the same event where the Pixel phone was announced, Google also debuted its Daydream View VR headset. For starters, the Pixel phone is the only Android device that is "Daydream-ready," meaning that it is optimized to work with the Daydream View headset. With an impressive feature set, the Pixel phone could also be a major competitor to other premium smartphones from companies like Apple or Samsung. It even has a camera that Google's Brian Rakowski said is the "best smartphone camera anyone has ever made" based on the DxOMark Mobile score of 89 it received. But, with a similarly high price point, Google will need to sell users on the features first.

For starters, this affects Android devotees and iPhone users (and Windows Phone or BlackBerry holdouts) who may be looking to make a switch. The device itself has all the features of a premium smartphone, and the camera will be a major draw to smartphone photographers. For iPhone users, it offers a convenient adapter and process to switch over your most important content. It also has some features and integrations that will be of interest to next-generation technology fans as well. The Google Home integration is key for those interested in the smart home experience, and the Daydream VR support will make the Pixel phone a good option for users who want to explore that technology as well. The Pixel phone could also be a good option for new smartphone users, or small business users, as it includes 24/7 support via chat or a phone call.

The Google Pixel brand has been around for quite some time, starting with the Chromebook Pixel in 2013, leading to another Chromebook Pixel and the Pixel C Android tablet in 2015. However, the Pixel phone was announced on October 4, 2016 at a Google event in San Francisco. That same day, preorders opened for the smartphone, and the limited edition blue model sold out almost immediately. The device is expected to be in stores by October 20, 2016, which is also the projected delivery date for pre-orders from Verizon.

First, if you want a device that is tied to a carrier, Verizon is your only option.

A second option is to order an unlocked Pixel phone directly from the Google Play Store, which you can do here, and then use it with a SIM card on the network of your choice. It is also compatible with Google's wireless service, Google Fi. Both purchasing options allow for purchasing the device outright, or financing it over the course of 24 months.

Google VP of product management Mario Queiroz shows off a Google Home virtual assistant device that could challenge the Amazon Echo at the firm’s annual I/O developers conference in Mountain View, Calif., May 18, 2016.  GLENN CHAPMAN/AFP/Getty Images Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email NEW YORK  Does your home really need a “smart speaker” that can answer questions, call you an Uber, turn off the lights or play music when you ask? You may be about to find out. Two years ago, Amazon introduced the Amazon Echo, an unassuming $180 cylinder that sits atop a kitchen counter or bookshelf, acting as a personal assistant that listens to you and does your bidding. Initially, the gadget’s main purpose was a little difficult to discern. But Echo and its Alexa voice recognition software have since become a sleeper hit, with an estimated three million gadgets sold as of April, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Making the home “smart” Now the Echo is getting some company. On Tuesday, Google announced a similar smart speaker called Google Home, which will be available in November for $129.  Play Video CBSN Google unveils Pixel smartphones Google is hoping to challenge the iPhone with its new Pixel smartphones. CNET senior editor Ashley Esqueda joins CBSN to discuss the new gadgets. It will perform many of the same tasks as Echo, including playing music and fielding questions plus controlling compatible lights and appliances. The Google Assistant that works with Home will also be able to access your calendar, Google Maps and other services if you allow. Apple has opened up its Siri personal assistant so that third-party developers can create new features for it, much the way Amazon has done with its Alexa software. Google Assistant is also opening up to outside apps in December. Sony is working on Xperia Agent, a digital assistant that connects to devices in the home. All these companies are chasing the smart-home market, which could grow to be a $71 billion global industry by 2018, up from $33 billion in 2013 and $25 billion in 2012, according to Juniper Research. That’s growing fast, although it’s still much smaller than the smartphone market, which the research firm IDC valued at about $412 billion in 2015. But while the Echo carved out an early success, it remains to be seen whether voice-recognition smart speakers will truly break into the mainstream. “They’re early, (but) the market is early, and we have a long way to go,” said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner. Learning new skills One key to the Echo’s success was Amazon’s willingness to work with third-party developers, allowing it to add new functions each week, making it easy for owners of the speaker to discover new ways to use it. (It launched with a few dozen so-called ‘skills’ and now has thousands). “Initially we got it for music,” said Brian Bishop, a business analyst in Tomball, Texas, whose family uses two Echos. “Later, when it controlled the lights and fans and outlets, that just made it even better.” Interest in smart homes appears to be rising as more people become enamored with their smartphones. A recent online survey of more than 4,600 adults in the U.S. by Forrester Research’s Technographics found 57 percent of them either had used or were interested in using a smart home device such as lights or thermostats designed for remote control. The Echo’s hands-free operation filled an undiscovered niche in the smart-home universe. Users can just say the wake word “Alexa” and direct it to do a task like turn on lights or set a timer. Since you don’t need to use a smartphone or tablet, that sets it apart from other smart home systems like those offered by Samsung or Apple. Speak to me People seem to have an easier time talking to a speaker that has no other interface than they do talking to a smartphone. Play Video CBS This Morning From Amazon Echo to refrigerators, CNET tests smart home products For eight months, a CNET team tested more than 40 smart home products in a first-of-its-kind "living laboratory." CNET.com editor-in-chief Lindse... “I’ve never used Cortana. I don’t use Google and my wife doesn’t use Siri, but everybody talks to Alexa,” Bishop from Texas said. “I couldn’t really tell you why. That was the only way to communicate, so we all got in the habit.” Buck Wise, an advertising executive in Portland, Oregon, tried several variants of smart home systems, but said the Echo worked best for him because of the hands-free speaker. He has lights, blinds, and his garage door synced with the Echo. “Alexa truly is the brain of our home and it would feel like 100 steps backwards to get through a day without her,” Wise said. What won him over? Commanding the device just by speaking – and without having to fire up an app – basically did the trick, he said. Big ambitions Google has a lot of catching up to do. Amazon first hinted at its Echo ambitions in a Super Bowl ad featuring Alec Baldwin and seen by more than 100 million people. Beginning in April the Echo went on sale at retail outlets including Best Buy, Home Depot electronic stores such as RadioShack and others. The same month, Amazon opened up its smart home capabilities to let all developers of smart home functions integrate with Alexa. It’s also launched two other Echo-like devices, the smaller $50 Dot – which it now sells in six-packs so people can have one in every room – and the portable $100 Tap, to give Alexa even broader reach. Dave Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president for devices, says the goal is for Alexa to keep getting smarter as it continues to build new “skills” over the coming years. “The hope is you can ask Alexa anything and it will be able to respond correctly, quickly and be able to be there,” he said. © 2016 The Associated Press.

Voices If Labour keeps telling working class people they're saying the wrong thing, they'll start talking to Theresa May Everyone has Google, but not everyone has been given the tools to educate themselves. You might have missed the memo on the ins and outs of intersectionality if you didn’t have an expensive private education Holly Baxter @h0llyb4xter Thursday 6 October 2016 17:45 BST Jackie Walker, who is Jewish, was stripped of her role with Momentum for saying Holocaust memorials should be more inclusive In 2012, my friend Rhiannon and I set up a tongue-in-cheek blog for our female friends called the Vagenda. A few weeks later, we were hailed by the press as an example of “feminists on the internet”. We hadn’t studied feminism, but we agreed with the media that we were, indeed, feminists, since we believed in gender equality. We felt no need to eschew the label. About six months later, I saw something interesting online and tweeted “Hey ladybros, what do you think of this?” with some innocuous link included. Needless to say, all hell broke loose. “What sort of piece of s**t so-called feminist website uses a word like that?” someone replied. “Have you thought about how that could make transgender people feel? Aren’t you educated?” It stung because, clearly, I wasn’t. I apologised to the person who had been offended and admitted I’d never thought about it, but would do so in future. Then the same thing happened a few months later when I co-wrote an article that said “in defence of Caitlin Moran, popular feminism has done a lot for the young women of today.” Moran was a racist, I was told (she’d implied she didn’t care much about diversity in the TV show Girls that week), and if we unthinkingly associated ourselves with her then we must not care about racism either. A few months after that, we sat on a panel with other feminist writers when a teenage girl stood up and asked a question about what cultural appropriation meant. “You can Google it,” said the respondent, sharply. “Everyone has Google. It’s not my job to educate you.” Dave Brown on Jeremy Corbyn 8 show all Dave Brown on Jeremy Corbyn 1/8 30 December 2015 Corbyn's reshuffle 2/8 4 December 2015 Corbyn and the Syria bombing vote 3/8 15 October 2015 Corbyn asks questions from the public at PMQs, meanwhile backbenchers plot to oust him 4/8 9 October 2015 Corbyn is unavailable to attend the Privy Council 5/8 1 October 2015 Conference rejects Corbyn’s call to debate Trident 6/8 29 September 2015 At Labour conference Corbyn and McDonnell press for a Robin Hood tax 7/8 19 September 2015 Corbyn’s hopes for a ‘new politics’ look optimistic in the face of a media barrage 8/8 16 June 2015 Corbyn enters Labour leadership race Yes, everyone has Google – but not everyone has been given the tools to educate themselves. You might have missed the memo on the ins and outs of intersectionality if you didn’t have an expensive private education or go to an elite university with an active Feminist Society where these ideas are routinely discussed. It doesn’t mean you wouldn’t be open to learning about it – but it does mean that what comes out of your mouth might not be quite so polished. This week threw up a few strange developments for left-wing politics: Theresa May is sick of the “liberal elite”, she announced, while Momentum is supposedly being run by them. The latter is hard to deny when Momentum chair Jon Lansman is a privately educated Oxbridge graduate and every local meeting of the movement seems to be run by a plummy-voiced young man with no day job and a double-barrelled surname. The kinds of people who always know the right thing to say. Read more Theresa May must be a good Conservative if she's fighting the elite What happens if you’re 62-year-old Jackie Walker, mixed race and Jewish, who spent her childhood being shunted around London by social services, living between foster families, her mentally ill single mother’s house, and children’s homes, while the other kids taunted her with aggressive racial jibes? Walker was, until recently, a vice-chair of Momentum. She was removed from her position three days ago after making controversial comments about how Holocaust memorials should be more inclusive and how she hadn’t found a definition of anti-Semitism she “could work with”. “[She is Jewish, and she] brought it up at a Jewish event, attended mostly by other Jews,” wrote Sam Kriss, who is also Jewish, for Vice. “It might not be opportune to bring it up on Question Time, or in parliament, but if we can't talk about it in this kind of space, where can we?” Where, indeed? The spaces are getting fewer and fewer, and now that they are run mainly by upper middle class white graduates championing the causes of the working classes. Other people attend, of course, but their voices are often drowned out by the self-appointed leaders taking control of the situation, the ones who have always been told they are the leaders of tomorrow.  Read more In memory of Jo Cox, the White Helmets must win the Nobel Prize And now the Tories are going to be the “new workers’ party”, according Theresa May’s conference speech this week. She justified the claim by saying that Labour hates “the public”, finds northerners ridiculous and southerners parochial, has abandoned its central ideology and become a gigantic safe space for “left-wing human rights lawyers”. The line works well for the Conservatives specifically because Labour’s so-called “grassroots movement” is now dominated by PhD students who roll their eyes when people like Jackie Walker open their mouths and wander off message – or, worse, shut them down entirely. When you’re the party of the workers, your members won’t always say the right thing. They won’t have the privilege of a fantastic education or the subtle training in personal PR offered by parents who are lawyers and bankers, whose dining rooms are an early training in how to handle supper with the CEO. It doesn’t mean that their ideas are unintelligent or foolish, merely that they could be unpolished. If you want inoffensive soundbites, honed until they’re stripped of meaning or controversy, then perhaps a fringe event at the Labour conference isn’t where you should be. Farage says UKIP MEP behaviour to that of a third-world parliament Labour voters were lost to Ukip because they want “straight talking” people, not spin. Now the Tory Government that is explicitly stating it wants to reach out to them too. Claiming that it’s “not your job to educate people” doesn’t really work in politics, where social empowerment is found in teaching one another about experiences, theories and ideology. There is nothing safe about a space where participants are berated for not using the proper terminology to describe a complex social phenomenon. And there is nothing noble or compassionate about throwing “uneducated” people under the bus because you don’t want to have a difficult conversation.  As she made abundantly clear this week, if Labour keeps closed down the dialogue with the working class, Theresa May is more than happy to open it.

SUBSCRIBE PPC + SEO = match made in marketing heaven Are your SEO and PPC teams working in silos? Columnist Julian Connors discusses several ways SEO and PPC can combine efforts to improve their strategies and drive more conversions. Julian Connors on October 6, 2016 at 10:23 am More It has been quite a year for the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). We’ve seen numerous algorithm updates, including a final Penguin update and the introduction of Possum. We also saw major changes to the way ads are displayed on desktop SERPs. Google continues to tweak how online consumers receive content through organic and paid listings. In order to meet the demands of today’s search landscape and connect with more qualified consumers, strategists need to create campaigns that treat SEO and PPC as a unified silo, as opposed to separate disciplines. Google’s never-ending quest for SERP perfection The ongoing adjustments to the SERP layout are meant to help Google better align with consumer objectives by improving the content quality and relevance of listings. While this certainly allows Google to become a better service provider for online consumers, it also presents new challenges for SEO strategists. Each adjustment requires strategists to develop new methods for ranking within prime search listings. Integrating SEO with PPC Developing digital marketing campaigns that combine SEO with PPC is not only necessary for achieving prime listing positions, it’s now the only way to maximize traffic and conversion opportunities. As the former Organic Search Manager for a Fortune 500 brand that specializes in home care, I was responsible for developing comprehensive, complex digital campaigns that focused on consumer behavior alignment and conversion optimization. When our team made the effort to combine both SEO and PPC strategies/data, we were able to identify a multitude of critical data points dedicated to consumer behavior, intentions and location/geography. This level of precision allowed us to: modify our organic keyword strategy so that we could create and optimize new content to rank within specific geographic locations, applying exact phrases used by our target audience to align with their intentions; adjust our PPC budgets so that we were only running ads within the most popular markets and effective time frames; and align our PPC ads with their offline marketing schedule to maximize awareness and conversions. Overall, these actions resulted in: 30-percent increase in organic traffic 25-percent increase in paid clicks 35-percent savings in ad spend 20-percent increase in quarterly profits Sharing information to create one rockstar team Most digital marketing agencies are built with SEO and PPC sitting on opposite sides of the building. Both teams work tirelessly, developing keyword strategies, creating unique content and employing a number of tactics that focus on attracting online consumers. Even though each team uses different systems and tactics to drive conversions, there is a tremendous amount of critical data that can be used to create a synergistic and harmonious relationship, bolstering results for everyone. Check out the following ways that SEO and PPC can combine efforts to improve their strategies, as well as to drive conversions like never before. Share keyword data to increase the intelligence of your campaigns Keywords are the foundation for any successful SEO or PPC campaign. For PPC strategists, keywords are used to facilitate creative relationships with consumers who are located further down the conversion funnel. In the world of SEO, keywords are used to dictate the information architecture of a website, as well as its content strategy. Both teams conduct keyword research in order to identify terms that align with their target audience’s online behavior, project traffic growth and drive qualified conversions. Because more consumers are using long-tail phrases and complete sentences when searching than ever before, keyword data must be shared across both teams in order to offer coordinated messages that keep brands top-of-mind and solicit qualified conversions. Set shared goals and combine metrics Using the information both teams collect doesn’t just offer more accuracy around consumer behavior; it can also be used to support your brand’s inbound marketing campaigns. Teams that combine their PPC data with organic user engagement metrics (e.g., average session duration, bounce rate, pages per session) are able to gain unique insight around how consumers are interacting with certain digital properties, as well as how they behave once they leave your site. The metrics your SEO and PPC teams review in order to establish their key performance indicators (KPIs) should be almost identical. When this happens, you are able to apply this information to other marketing channels like PR, social media or email marketing. Remove silos to improve production Approaching SEO and PPC as two separate silos isolates critical information and diminishes the productivity level of even the most well-executed online campaigns. It almost never makes sense to keep these two disciplines apart, as the teams can offer each other particular points of information that are vital for identifying and fulfilling conversion opportunities. Use data that informs cross-channel decisions and justifies action When it comes to gathering enough actionable data to develop robust, intelligent strategies, extracting information from one specific field, like SEO or PPC, is not enough. Although the quality of your organic data may provide insight on how to create functional plans, the amount of verified information organic search can capture may not be sufficient to justify real action. Conversely, information that’s gathered from the search engines themselves as a result of paid search activity is both valuable and based on a substantial sample size that allows you to move forward confidently. If your organization treats SEO and PPC as two distinct entities, try to make sure that your efforts are aligned through shared: reporting; objectives; and communication portals. The goal of merging both disciplines together is not to have the same people performing the same type of work. Instead, it is meant to increase internal awareness of key conversion opportunities. Action & impact: how to maximize SERP visibility Now that we have covered the principles that allow your SEO and PPC teams to work together efficiently, use the following tactics to own as much real estate within Google SERPs as possible. Landing page optimization Optimizing your landing pages to drive qualified traffic and conversions is a fundamental component of any digital marketing campaign. SEO strategists can provide their PPC counterparts with critical information around consumer intentions, objectives and demands to reduce bounce rate and increase click-through-rates (CTR). PPC strategists can then use their insights around consumer online activity to perpetuate paid ads that only appear in front of the most qualified consumers possible. By doing this, both teams are able to support each other in ways that improve user experience, maximize relevant traffic and reduce wasted ad spend. Approach SEO & PPC holistically Running paid ad campaigns that 1) offer precise messages and 2) are located next to your organic listings on Google can increase overall CTR and lead to a higher return on your investment. While managing the online campaign of Sonos in 2015, our team ran paid ads alongside keywords that the electronics company already ranked for organically. This type of positioning was extremely effective for creating the sense that we were more prominent than our competitors and thus, more credible. Because of this, total revenue through organic and paid channels increased by 37 percent year over year. Understand seasonality Share seasonal data and information relating to other offline variables to learn how to approach and optimize for specific times throughout the year when consumer activity peaks. Use this information to create a calendar of events that guides you on how to: create organic content that aligns with specific consumers within specific locations; run paid ads that contain unique messaging based on location and intention; maximize brand awareness during peak activity points like the holiday shopping season; and increase consumer reaction and conversions during seasonal low points. Get in front of the competition SEO and PPC strategists should work together as a cohesive unit to share key points of information that highlight how and what the competition is doing from a digital perspective. Create monitoring systems that identify your competitors in terms of: positioning within SERPs; pricing; key message points/branding initiatives; and primary and secondary keyword terms. Use this information to adjust your ad spend, to improve CTR and to outrank your opponents by taking up more real estate within SERPs.

SUBSCRIBE Dynamic Ad Extensions: don’t let your sitelinks and callouts get out of date Keep your ad extensions up-to-date and applied everywhere with the latest AdWords script from columnist Daniel Gilbert at Brainlabs. Daniel Gilbert on October 6, 2016 at 9:29 am More Even with expanded text ads, there’s still always more information you want to show searchers. That’s why we use ad extensions: callouts add extra info, sitelinks add extra info and links. But the extra info — and the extra links — may change over time. Maybe you want a callout saying your minimum price, or how big your range is. That’s not going to stay the same over time. Or maybe you want sitelinks to be topical. There’s not much point giving a link to Valentine Gift Ideas when it’s April, or Barbecue Accessories when the weather’s bad, or Freshly Baked Hot Cakes when you’ve just sold out. AdWords has ad customizers and ad params for constantly updating ad text, but nothing for updating extensions. So Brainlabs (my employer) came up with a two-part solution that we like to call dynamic ad extensions: a Google Sheet to define the sitelinks and callouts with variable placeholders, and the variables to insert into their text; and an AdWords Script to turn those definitions into real extensions. But why bother with the script? Why not just write out the extensions with a spreadsheet and copy them into AdWords Editor manually? Because you don’t just run the script this once — you can schedule this to run as often as you want. When new campaigns and ad groups come along, the script will give them all the right extensions, and you don’t have to lift a finger. And you’re not just writing one set of extensions — the variables can be changed. They’re in their own cells separate from the ad text, so you can update them however you like. Here are some ideas: Use basic functions and the current time from NOW() (just make sure the spreadsheet has the right time zone!): Change sitelinks by time of day — for example, show the most appropriate menu using =if(hour(now())<11,"Breakfast Menu",if(hour(now())<17,"Lunch Menu","Dinner Menu")) Get seasonal text and final URLs based on the date. Automatically change sitelinks from Summer Dresses to Autumn Coats to Christmas Sweaters. Set up countdowns. Be a bit more fancy, and use Google Sheet’s functions to import data: IMPORTFEED can access RSS and ATOM feeds. IMPORTHTML, IMPORTDATA or IMPORTXML can use any URL that has data in the right format. GOOGLEFINANCE can get currency conversions and stock information (and if you want to see it in action, see our currency converter dashboard). Fancier still, write a Google Apps Script within the spreadsheet to fill in the variable cells: Use UrlFetchApp to get data from your site. For example, rather than a sitelink saying, “Wide Range Available,” you could check the actual number available and put that into the sitelink. The Shopping Content Service lets you get data from your Merchant Center’s shopping feed — for example, you could show your cheapest prices or make sure sitelinks point to things that are in stock. Use the Drive service to get data from your files stored in Google Drive. This could get you any information you can think of. Or, simplest of all, you could just manually update the cells! You still have benefit of knowing all extensions are updated and are applied to all applicable campaigns or groups. You can also add new sitelinks and callouts to the sheet whenever you feel like it. The script checks which of the extensions already exist, and it creates them if they don’t. You can also change which campaigns or ad groups the extensions get attached to (but the script won’t detach extensions from campaigns that aren’t covered any more — you’ll have to do that yourself). Once an extension is created, the script will update it, rather than create a new one (There’s a hidden column that will automagically fill with extension IDs). So if there’s a campaign that’s not covered by the settings in the spreadsheet but uses the same sitelinks, it will still be updated. So, you want to try this out for yourself? First go to the template sheet — in the File menu, click “Make a copy” to get a version for yourself. In your version, replace the example extensions with the details for your extensions: The Sitelinks tab has columns for Dynamic Headline, Dynamic DL1 (for description line 1), Dynamic DL2 (for description line 2) and Dynamic URL. The Callouts tab has a column for Dynamic Callout (for the callout text). You can fill these in with the text you want for your extensions. Where you’d like to have variable text, you use {variable column name:default text}. For sitelinks, you can leave the description lines blank, but not the headline or URL. The next columns give the variables. Callouts only have two variables, var1 and var2. As sitelinks have more text to fill in, they can have up to five variables: the columns var1 to var5. For example, if the Dynamic Headline said {var1:Many} {var2:Seasonal} Dresses, var1 said “302” and var2 said “Summer”, then the script would create a sitelink with the headline 302 Summer Dresses. If var1 is “300000002” — which would be too long to fit — the script would use the default text instead, making the headline Many Summer Dresses. In the Sitelinks tab, the next columns are Headline, DL1, DL2 and URL; in the Callouts tab, the next column is Callout. You don’t fill in these columns — every time it runs, the script will fill them in with the actual values currently being used. Mobile Preferred can be Yes or No, depending on whether you want the extension to be mobile-preferred or not. Entity level is either Campaign or Ad Group, depending on which level you want your extensions. The next columns are used to pick which campaign/ad group the extensions will be attached to: If you want the extensions in just one campaign/ad group, then fill its exact name into Entity name is. If you’d like the extensions in all campaigns/ad groups with a certain word or phrase in the name, then put it under Entity name contains. If you’d like the extensions in all campaigns/ad groups except those with a certain word or phrase in the name, then put it under Entity name excludes. If you’d like the extensions in all campaigns/ad groups with a certain label, then put the label name in Entity has label. Make sure you type it precisely correctly — the capitalization does matter for labels. If the Entity level is Ad Group, then you can also fill in Parent is, Parent contains and Parent excludes — these are like Entity name is, Entity name contains and Entity name excludes, except they are used to filter the campaign name rather than the ad group name. Once you have the spreadsheet set up, go to your AdWords account and copy and paste the script. Then there are a couple of settings at the top of the script: Change spreadsheetUrl to the URL of your version of the spreadsheet. If there’s a problem with running the script — for example, a campaign label has disappeared, or some part of the extension text was too long — then an email will be sent to all of the addresses in emailRecipients. These addresses should be surrounded by quotes and comma-separated. Alternatively, if you don’t want errors to be emailed, you can leave the array empty. The first run will create the extensions. Then you can set up a schedule, so it can run as frequently as you think is necessary: every time the script runs, it will update the extensions and make sure they’re attached to everything that needs them. (Note that if you’ve not run the script before, you can do a preview run to see what the extensions will look like. But it won’t show which campaigns the extensions will be attached to — to do that, the extensions need to actually be created, and they won’t be created in a preview run.)

SUBSCRIBE Why are payday loan ads still showing on Google after the ban? A deep look at how the payday loan industry is able to keep advertising despite Google's policy changes. Ginny Marvin on October 6, 2016 at 12:41 pm More To consumer advocates, payday loans have become synonymous with predatory lending. The small short-term loans often come with astronomical interest rates that can pull consumers who are trying to get by from paycheck to paycheck into a deepening hole of debt. Just this week, the FTC fined a payday lending group $1.3 billion for deceptive loan practices. Industry watchdog groups have been advocating for more regulation and pressing for change, and in May, Google announced it would start to ban payday and high-interest loan ads. The ban started rolling out the week of July 20. There were estimates the move could cost Google millions in lost ad revenue. Yet, more than two months later, it appears the ban is likely having little to no impact on Google’s bottom line. as ads continue to fill the available slots on desktop and mobile. Why? Because it’s not an actual ban, and the advertisers quickly figured out how to change their messaging to meet Google’s policies. In a review over the past month, I have found advertisers showing messaging on landing pages from Google ads that complies with the new restrictions (APR rates no higher than 36 percent and minimum repayment period of 60 days). But the fine print shows the ranges shown on the landing pages are essentially just a way of getting around payday loan policy. And fine print isn’t the only way the companies are evading the rules. Non-Direct lenders aren’t responsible for actual APRs With very few exceptions — Discover Personal Loans and CashNetUSA being two — the advertisers are lead generators, or loan brokers, which means they aren’t doing the actual lending. By being one step removed from the actual lending process, these advertisers can list terms that fall within Google’s payday loan policy on their ad landing pages without having to actually be beholden to those terms. The terms listed on the landing pages (often in fine print at the bottom of the page) from the lead generators’ advertising varies, but often you’ll see some terms that fall within the range of Google’s policy, but when read carefully, make clear that the actual APR could vary outside that range (i.e., higher). Here are just two examples (bolding is mine). From LoansOfSuccess.com: “LoansOfSuccess cannot guarantee any APR, since we are a lending network. Though a Representative APR can range between 5.99–35.99%. The Maximum APR is 35.99. When accepting a loan from a lender, the lender can provide a different APR than our range. Please check the loan disclosure before approving and signing the agreement for your loan.” From WeLoan2U.com: “Consumers, who qualify with a lender, can be offered loans with APRs below 36% and have payment terms ranging from 61 days to 60 months, or more. Cash transfer times may vary between lenders and may depend on your individual financial institution. For details, questions or concerns regarding your loan, please contact your lender directly.” LendingTree took this a step farther by explicitly stating on its landing page that because I clicked through “via a paid Google advertisement,” the offers I’ll see on LendingTree will feature quotes “of no greater than 35.99 percent APR with terms from 61 days to 180 months.” Sounds great, except “Your actual rate depends … and will be agreed upon by you and the lender.” [Click to enlarge]When I called to ask LendingTree if the loan offers I might receive from lenders could potentially be higher than the 35.99 percent APR listed on the landing page, a representative said that the loan rates “shouldn’t be higher than that limit shown, but could be because the rates are up to the the lenders.” QuickLoanTree.com lists APR terms stating “the maximum Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is 35.99%,” yet adds that “the lender can provide a different APR than our range.” The loan calculator on the QuickLoanTree.com landing page also shows a different APR depending on how a user gets to the landing page. The APR of 5.99 percent shown above appears when coming from an AdWords ad. Click from an organic listing on Google or an ad on Bing, however, and it starts with an APR of 6.30 percent. I tried calling QuickLoanTree several times to ask about the terms, and each time I got an automated message that said, “There are no loan agents to assist you over the phone,” and directed me to a different website that I was never able to catch the name of. Direct policy violations are rare In looking at dozens of ads, I only found one that listed terms that directly violate Google’s payday loan policy on its landing page. WeLend2U.com shows an APR rate range of 35.80 percent to 4,999 percent (that’s a comma, not a period) from an AdWords ad on moble. I’ve seen this off and on on mobile for several weeks. Seeing double Ads for LoansOnline.direct and LoansForSuccess.com landed on nearly identical pages, from the image to the headline and lead form. It’s not clear if LoansOfSuccess set up LoansOnline.direct or if LoansOnline.direct copied the site. LoansOfSuccess.com is registered in the US, and LoansOnline.direct is registered in Panama. CashNetUSA using call-only ads and Google Map Maker CashNetUSA is a direct lender that I found using various tactics to attract customers. Below is an example of a call-only ad the company used with the domain name personal-loan.phoneloans.us and a headling stating “PayDay Loans Over Phone” after the phone number. Call-only ads do not link to a website. Clicking on the ad prompts the user to call the business on their phones. When I called the number and was told I had contacted CashNetUSA, I asked if I could get a same-day loan if I qualified. The agent said their loans are paid out next-day, unless I was a Wells Fargo customer, then I could get it the same day. Wells Fargo is one of the commercial banks that provides the capital for CashNetUSA loans. This call-only ad from personal-loan.phoneloans.com connects to a CashNetUSA call center. While not specifically ad related, the other area where I found CashNetUSA using less-than-transparent practices is in Google Maps. Google Map Maker allows anyone to add a business to Google Maps, and the feature can be abused. When I search for “payday loans,” the local pack of results in my area displays one verified location for RepubliCash and two unverified listings that look like Google Map Maker spam. I tried calling My Maine Payday since the number is local. The message? “Sorry, but the user’s mailbox can’t accept more message.” Then I turned to Payday Loan in Portland and went down a rabbit hole. I clicked on the website link and ended up on maine-payday-loans.xyz/location/portland.php. The phone number on that landing page was the same as the number listed in Maps. It connected to CashNetUSA. The agent, not surprisingly, said he did not know why there was a local listing on Google Maps that connected to CashNetUSA because “we are an online only business headquartered in Chicago”. [Click to enlarge]By the way, here’s what CashNetUSA lists for the actual APRs for payday loans in my area on its website. Differing policies within and among search engines By working the system, these companies have made it increasingly hard for consumers to make educated decisions. Within Google’s own search results — ads, local listings and regular organic listings — the offers consumers see can vary. The payday loan ad ban applies to ads only. Mircosoft’s Bing search engine has not instituted a specific ban on payday loans, but its financial products policy notes that ads for payday and other small-dollar loans are among the products that “can raise appreciable compliance concerns and may attract heightened scrutiny.” In some cases, consumers won’t have the option of turning to agencies like the FTC to file complaints. Two advertisers I found, BlueTrustLoans.com and MaxLend.com, list APR ranges of over 471 percent to over 841 percent in the fine print on their landing pages from ads on Bing. In the very, very fine print, both note that they are run by American Indian Tribes “not subject to suit or service of process.” Instead, “potential forums for dispute resolution will be limited to those available under Tribal law and your loan agreement.” At the very bottom in bold on both sites, the fine print ends with, “If you are not comfortable doing business with a sovereign instrumentality that cannot be sued in court, you should discontinue use of this website.” [Click to enlarge] No easy answers This is an industry that has considerable lobbying power. It is currently fighting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s proposed rule to address the debt traps that often occur with these types of loans. The National Association of Federal Credit Unions is among the groups pushing back on the proposed changes. In some ways, Google’s efforts to crack down on predatory lending within its ads has only acted to further mask the actual workings of these companies as they keenly adapt to the policies without having to change practices. And it’s yet another game of whack-a-mole for the search giant. A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land, “We continue to implement our policy and will take action on ads and advertisers that are not in compliance. These actions include removing ads and permanently banning advertisers from using AdWords.” I’m told that since introducing the policy change, Google has disapproved more than three million policy-violating ads before they could enter the ad auction and has taken action on thousands of advertisers’ accounts that were in violation of the payday loan policies. The implementation of the new policy is only a few months old at this point, and Google is sure to continue to fine-tune how it gets implemented on the back end. Whether it will have a material effect on consumers remains to be seen. Google certainly has its part to play — and is still benefiting financially from these advertising practices — but in many ways, this is much bigger than a “Google problem.” And it’s is one of those cases where Google and Bing (and others) should be encouraged to coordinate on ad policies in the interest of consumers online.

SUBSCRIBE After 4 months & 125M+ pages indexed, where are we with AMP? Contributor Kristi Kellogg recaps a session from SMX East 2016 in which Google, Condé Nast and Vox Media share successes and challenges with Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). Kristi Kellogg on October 6, 2016 at 1:43 pm More From left to right: Googler Adam Greenberg, Condé Nast’s John Shehata, Vox Media’s Elite Truong, and Search Engine Land’s Danny Sullivan. Googler Adam Greenberg, who creates global partnerships with the AMP Project, kicked off the “Getting AMPed” session at last week’s SMX East 2016 with a look at AMP from Google’s perspective. Later in the session, Condé Nast’s John Shehata and Vox Media’s Elite Truong shared the publisher perspective. Why did Google implement accelerated mobile pages (AMP)? Greenberg said they wanted to solve the all-too-familiar problems on mobile: Page loads slowly. Scrolling is non-responsive. Content shifts around. Google wanted to make pages fast in a way that was easy for developers to implement, enabled monetization and embraced the open web. Thus was born the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project. Forty percent of people abandon a website that takes more than three seconds to load. That’s an enormous amount of potential loss. Google wants to ameliorate that pain point with AMP. A huge class of content on the web is leaf pages — not home pages, but the stuff that stems off of them. This includes articles, blog posts, recipes and so on. These leaf pages are a perfect match for AMP. AMP has a validatable spec. Its requirements and restrictions ensure the right bits are arranged in just the right way. There is also a web components library associated with AMP. Slide by Rudy Galfi, Google’s lead product manager for AMP. AMP is open-source; everything is out in the open at github.com/amppoject/amphtml. AMP has seen fantastic momentum and engagement. More than 7,700 developers have engaged with AMP, and there have been more than 2,100 pull requests and 98 releases, Greenberg said. More than 125 million documents have been indexed in AMP across over 650 million domains. AMP is fast, also, because of caching. Caching cuts down on the time it takes to pull up content. The AMP cache is free, and alternatively, you are able to use your own cache if you’d prefer. AMP means an elevated performance baseline for all. A blink of an eye takes 0.3 to 0.4 seconds. The median load time for an AMP page is 0.7 seconds. It renders, then, in two blinks of any eye. Meanwhile, there is a 22-second median load time for non-AMP pages. The AMP timeline AMP can be integrated with other platforms, including Microsoft Bing, Nuzzel, WordPress, Pinterest and Twitter. Next steps You can use Google Search Console’s AMP Validation Report to see errors across your site, both for structured data and AMP validation. Go to https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home. Verify the proper implementation according to AMP specs. Implement Google markup validation. Go to https://www.ampproject.org/docs and https://www.ampproject.org/roadmap to learn more about AMP. AMP: Above & Beyond By Adam Greenberg from Search Marketing Expo – SMX Publisher perspective Next up was John Shehata, the VP of SEO at Condé Nast. (Condé Nast owns 20 print and digital publications, including Vogue, W, Allure, Architectural Digest, Ars Technica, Bon Appétit, Glamour, Golf Digest, Golf World, GQ, The New Yorker, Self, Vanity Fair and Wired.) Shehata pointed out that the majority of overall mobile search traffic still comes from non-AMP search results — but if you’re looking at newly published content alone, AMP results account for almost twice as much traffic as non-AMP results. Here’s how to make your AMPs discoverable: This slide is by Rudy Galfi, Google’s lead product manager for AMP. Shehata doubts that AMP is truly not a direct ranking factor. At the very least, he thinks it is an indirect ranking factor. Psychologically, users are more inclined to click on the results that have the AMP results. John Shehata’s Validation Tools More facts about AMP Make sure your analytics are calculating visits rather than pre-renders. Visit the Page Visibility API to test this. AMP shines during events — 50 to 60 percent of SERPs associated with the Sept. 26, 2016, debates were composed of AMP results. Shehata doesn’t think home pages matter in AMP. If you have short codes, it’s much easier for you to convert HTML to AMP HTML. Shehata believes Google is moving increasingly to AMP Rich Cards. Getting AMPed!! By John Shehata from Search Marketing Expo – SMX Vox Media’s move to AMP Elite Truong is the product manager of partner platforms at Vox Media. Over half of the readers, viewers and listeners for Vox Media across eight brands are on mobile. As soon as the company saw AMP was an open-source project for contributors, they were interested. It’s an opportunity to make the content feel like your won content, Truong said. It’s a great source for live news, too. Before embarking on AMP implementation, Truong advises that brands and businesses make sure they have the resources to launch and support it. As an example, it’s taken Vox a year to get through three of their eight brands — and it was a challenge. Make sure your news producers understand the benefits of AMP so you can all work together. To determine whether implementing AMP was a success for Vox, Truong looked at: reader retention; general page views vs. total mobile search traffic; and recirculation (pages per session). Truong displayed the percentage of Google Traffic served through AMP on the three Vox brands that have implemented AMP: SB Nation: 23 percent Vox.com: 15 percent The Verge: 15 percent Truong attributes SB Nation’s stronger results to the fact this site covers a lot of sports events, which thrive on AMP. Looking ahead, Vox will begin implementing premium ad products on partner platforms. Also, when a reader finishes a Vox.com article on AMP, Truong wants to make sure they read another.

SUBSCRIBE Report: Number of Google organic blue links results drops from 10 to 8.5 Searchmetrics released their 2016 study on universal and extended search results showing some surprising changes in the Google user interface and results. Barry Schwartz on October 6, 2016 at 1:14 pm More Searchmetrics has released a new study today showing the impact of the ever-changing user interface of the Google search results. The study says that now, Google is less likely to show 10 organic blue links. Instead, Google shows only 8.5 blue links on average but supplements those links with featured snippets, app packs, knowledge panels, images, videos and more. You can download the full report over here, but here are some highlights: Organic blue links drop from 10 to 8.5 per search query: Searchmetrics says you are less likely to see 10 links on a Google search results page for your query. Universal search results change from 2015 to 2016: Look at how integration of images, videos, product listing ads, news and maps have changed from 2015 to 2016 in the Google search results: Knowledge panels, direct answers and app packs Google has been showing rich results both on desktop on mobile, but how often they show those results depends on the query and category of the search. Around one out of every 10 mobile queries return mobile app packs, and you are twice as likely to see direct answers or featured snippets on desktop as you are on mobile, according to this study. Finally, here is a chart showing the percentage of time you will see a rich result, by type, by desktop versus mobile: “Gone are the days when optimizing for search was all about trying to appear in the classic ten blue organic links on Google’s first page,” said Lars Hartkopf, EMEA marketing director at Searchmetrics. “Now marketers must also plan their strategies to include opportunities around a variety of Universal and Extended Search boxes, understanding how to create and optimize content which Google will consider useful for each.” About The Author Barry Schwartz Barry Schwartz is Search Engine Land's News Editor and owns RustyBrick, a NY based web consulting firm.

Stock Sinks As Buyout Speculation Cools Off a Bit Twitter's list of potential buyers may not be as impressive as rumors suggested. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Oct 6, 2016 at 12:45PM What happened Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock fell as much as 19.5% on Thursday morning -- and is down about 18.7% at the time of this writing -- after Recode reported Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) do not plan on buying Twitter. Twitter headquarters. Image source: Aaron Durand (@everydaydude) for Twitter, Inc. Previously, there was speculation Google and Disney, along with salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), may have been interested in acquiring Twitter. But Recode says "sources close to the situation" assert Google "does not currently plan to make a bid for Twitter" and Disney "is not going to make an offer." Notably, however, Recode confirmed that Twitter is, indeed, still interested in selling. Furthermore, Recode said Salesforce is also still considering buying Twitter. So what With both Google and Walt Disney reportedly out of the running, potential buyers for Twitter may not have to bid as competitively. While this may be better for salesforce.com if it follows through with a bid, it may mean Twitter won't have as much negotiating power if it does solicit bids. In addition, if Google and Walt Disney are truly out of the running, as Recode reports, this highlights two successful market leaders that are uninterested in Twitter, sparking concern over the company's ability to attract other potential suitors. Now what Investors should keep in mind that all of this is speculation. It's not certain Twitter will be bought out. And even if the social platform is bought out, it's impossible to guess what price the buyer will pay. From here, all investors can do is wait for any official announcements from Twitter. Until there's a press release, investors should use caution when reading headlines about a potential buyout.

Rob Jackson Oct 6th, 2016 +9,547 Google announced a boatload of new products this week, but are they worth buying? We give our quick take on the Google Pixel & Pixel XL, Google Home, Google WiFi, Google VR’s Daydream View, and the Chromecast Ultra. Google Pixel & Pixel XL (Verdict: Maybe) Goodbye, Nexus. Google has replaced Google’s “flagship” line with the Pixel line, which seems to be a move away from giving the manufacturer credit in favor of having a device that more fully boasts the Google brand. The Google Pixel does that beautifully by building a solid phone inside and out, but for the launch of such a groundbreaking move, the phone lacks any groundbreaking features. Although it packs the most powerful processor available, features one of the world’s best smartphone cameras, and comes loaded with Google Assistant built-in, you’d be hard-pressed to find a compelling reason the Pixel is a “must-have” device. If you’re ready for an upgrade? It’s definitely worth consideration, but starting at $649 for the Pixel and $769 for the Pixel XL, it’s also on the pricey side. Google Home (Verdict: Buy) Take the power of the new Google Assistant, put it on your countertop, and you’ve got Google Home. The small speaker looks attractive, listens for voice commands, and is ready to answer your questions and follow your beck and call 24/7. Powered by Google’s knowledge graph, you’ll be surprised how many questions it nails right on the head, and the ability to play music on the device or cast video content to nearby TV’s is amazing. The best part of Google Home is that it will get better and better over time. Google has already expressed their interest in helping the service learn about you, develop a personality/relationship, and understand emotion, which will in turn help Google turn their assistant into more of a conversational butler/friend than a robotic utility. I’ve surprised some people by claiming I’m unimpressed with Google Assistant, but not because I don’t love it. I do love it , but people don’t realize their Android phones can do almost everything Google Assistant can, tucked inside a simple feature called Google Voice search (learn tips for it here). Google Home takes Google Assistant to the next level by bringing the power of Android and Google into your home, to share with the people around you, without everyone staring at their own little screen. Google WiFi (Verdict: Buy) If you’ve got a house larger than 1500 square feet, chances are that your WiFi signal varies depending on where you are in the house. That sounds so old school. Plenty of options exist to solve this problem, but in an effort to ensure the smoothest connectivity experience, Google is getting in on the fun. The Google WiFi device costs $129 for one or $299 for a pack of three. The devices should be placed so they blanket your house in signal, with each device covering a maximum of roughly 1500 square feet. If like me, you struggle with the WiFi signal in the furthest reaches of your house, you’ll definitely want to get Google WiFi. On the other hand, before you make the purchase, you may want to call your service provider and make sure they’re giving you the bandwidth and coverage you actually deserve. Google Home+ with WiFi (Verdict: Doesn’t Exist) My biggest and only gripe with Google Home and Google WiFi is that you’ve got to buy them separately. I want Google Home in several rooms in my house. I want Google WiFi in several rooms in my house. Why doesn’t Google have a Google Home Plus option that combines both of these features in a single package? This seems like a no-brainer. Unless I’m overlooking technical limitations, I’ve got to think Google will offer a more universal solution in the future, which will be highly annoying to early adopters that have individual gadgets dotted all over their house. Google Chromecast Ultra (Verdict: Maybe) When the Chromecast launched it very quickly reached mass appeal thanks to its inexpensive nature (only $35) and ability to solve a fundamentally simple problem (I want to show my phone/laptop screen on my TV). I’d recommend that everyone buy a Chromecast, but I rate the Ultra a “Maybe” because it solves a problem most people don’t yet have: support for 4K video. In addition to 4K support the Chromecast Ultra also has an ethernet port for quicker speeds. Whether or not you should buy the Chromecast Ultra depends on a few things: Have a 4K TV? Buy the Chromecast Ultra. Don’t yet have a Chromecast? Buy the Chromeast Ultra. Already have Chromecast? No need to upgrade unless you want 4K support. Google VR – Daydream View (Verdict: Kid’s Only) The Daydream View is easily the best VR Headset when compared to other affordable VR Headsets like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard. It’s easily the most comfortable, looks great, has a machine washable lining, and does what you’d expect. My gripe is that budget VR just isn’t that cool. The excitement of virtual reality relies on an immersive experience and cheap solutions like the Daydream View make you feel like you’re using a vintage red ViewMaster instead of a next generation experience. If you’ve got kids or extra cash to splash around, sure, drop the $79 and enjoy the toy, but if you’re hoping for a true VR experience, save your money and buy the HTC Vive, Oculus, or Sony VR.

 One of Google's self-driving cars was involved in an accident that sent its driver to the hospital Avery Hartmans Oct. 6, 2016, 1:34 PM 7,997 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google's self driving cars Reuters/Elijah Nouvelage One of Google's self-driving cars got into a nasty collision last month — so nasty, it sent the car's human driver to the hospital.  While no injuries were reported at the scene of the accident, Google notes in its monthly report on self-driving car accidents that the driver voluntarily checked himself into the hospital and was evaluated by medical staff and released. The accident was reported by some news media at the time , but the new Google report provides a more detailed account of the incident, which occurred on September 23 in Google's hometown of Mountain View, California. According to the report, one of Google's Lexus-model self-driving cars was going through a green light at an intersection on Phyllis Ave. in Mountain View when the car's autonomous technology sensed another vehicle coming towards it that seemed as if it was going to run through its red light. The Google car began applying the brakes on its own, then the driver switched the car into manual mode and took over — but maybe not quickly enough. What happened next sounds like it was probably very frightening for its human driver: The other vehicle came into the intersection at 30 miles per hour, running a red light and hitting the Google car's right side, effectively t-boning the car. Google said its car was traveling at 22 miles per hour at the time of the collision. Both the Google car and the other vehicle "sustained substantial damage," the report says.  A witness at the time told 9to5Google that the Google employee looked "dazed" while waiting for a tow truck to arrive.  The driver of the vehicle was mostly unharmed after the accident, but complained of neck pain and was encouraged to go to the hospital. He was evaluated and immediately released by medical staff. The accident is the most serious to date involving a Google self-driving car prototype, which Google has been testing for several years.  While the accident appears to have been caused by the other driver, the incident is sure to raise further questions about how safely self-driving cars can be integrated into real-world traffic situations.  In this instance, the Google car sensed it was at risk of getting hit by another car. But it's unclear if Google's self-driving technology currently has the capability to then take steps to avoid a collision rather than requiring a human driver to take over.  Google has said it believes its self-driving car technology will help reduce the thousands of driving accidents and deaths that occur every year.   SEE ALSO: Here are all the companies and divisions within Alphabet, Google's parent company NOW WATCH: Here are all the radars, sensors and cameras Uber's self-driving cars use to get around Loading video...

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Samsung wants its own personal assistant, acquires team that created Siri By Marisa Kendall / October 6, 2016 at 9:58 AM The world of virtual personal assistants is getting crowded. There are those that live in your phone — Apple has Siri and Google unveiled its new Google Assistant this week. There are standalone models such as Google’s new Google Home and Amazon’s Echo. And then there are those that dwell in your online messaging services, such as Facebook’s Messenger bots. The newest addition to the club may come from Samsung. The electronics company on Wednesday night announced it will acquire Viv Labs — the San Jose-based artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri. The move shows Samsung is interested in a personal assistant of its own — according to the company, the buy is part of its plan to develop an AI system that works across all Samsung devices and services. As part of the deal Samsung gets access to Siri creators Dag Kittlaus and Adam Cheyer, as well as Viv’s third co-founder, Chris Brigham.  The team will work closely with Samsung’s mobile business, but will operate independently under their own leadership, according to a news release. “Unlike other existing AI-based services, Viv has a sophisticated natural language understanding, machine learning capabilities and strategic partnerships that will enrich a broader service ecosystem,” Injong Rhee, CTO of Samsung’s mobile communications business, wrote in the release. “Viv was built with both consumers and developers in mind. This dual focus is also what attracted us to Viv as an ideal candidate to integrate with Samsung home appliances, wearables and more, as the paradigm of how we interact with technology shifts to intelligent interfaces and voice control.” The Verge described the Viv assistant as “incredible” when it debuted in New York earlier this year. What makes Viv special appears to be its ability to handle queries on its own by connecting to third-party merchants to buy things and book reservations instead of passing off requests to a web browser. The Washington Post described Viv’s ability to order a delivery pizza from start to finish without requiring the user to type anything, use a web search or download a food delivery app. “At Viv, we’re building the simplest way for anyone to talk to devices and services everywhere,” Kittlaus wrote. “We see a future that is decidedly beyond apps — where you can get what you need quickly and easily no matter where you are, or what device you are near.” Photo: In this July 28, 2016, file photo, a color blending feature of the Galaxy Note 7 is demonstrated in New York.

Google is taking on all comers Andrew Fraser , afraser@stcloudtimes.com 12:35 p.m. CDT October 6, 2016 Google's newest smartphone, Pixel. (Photo: Google, https://madeby.google.com/phone/) Google has always been in several markets, but this year it feels like it's decided to take the fight to everybody. At a press event this week, the company unveiled new products in mobile, home automation and entertainment. Google also announced release dates for upcoming virtual reality and home wi-fi products, which I’ll be comparing to competitors in the next few weeks. Here’s what to look forward to from Google’s newest products: Pixel Google’s fall event was centered around Pixel, its newest smartphone. With the latest iPhone headphone port controversy and Samsung’s heat issues with the Galaxy Note 7, Google has an opening to draw consumers to a new, drama-free phone. Google’s previous phones have been in the Nexus line, but they’ve gone with the Pixel branding for the new models. Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said of the Pixel name, "it's always represented the best of hardware and software, designed and built by Google." The new phone is available in two models, the 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL. While both Pixel devices are powered by a Snapdragon 821 processor, Pixel XL has a higher resolution screen (1440p vs. 1080p) and higher-capacity battery (3,450mAh vs. 2,770mAh) than the base Pixel. Google is proud of Pixel’s 12.3 megapixel rear camera, which was given a score of 89 — the best right now for a smartphone camera — by DxOMark Mobile. Pixel is the first Android phone with the new Google Assistant built in. Google hopes seamless compatibility with its services, like the Google productivity suite and unlimited photo/video storage, will be an attractive draw for buyers. Google has set the price for Pixel and Pixel XL at $649 and $769, respectively. Though these prices are in line with flagship phones from competitors, it would have been nice if Google would’ve been able to get Pixel closer in price to the Nexus 6P, which started at $499. Even a small edge on price would help the phone stand out against top competitors. Pixel is a Verizon carrier-exclusive at launch, so other carriers won’t have it in stores, but consumers on other carriers can purchase an unlocked version of the phone compatible with all domestic carriers on Google’s website (google.com/pixel). Look for Pixel and Pixel XL to be available Oct. 20, with pre-orders open now.  (Photo: Google, http://home.google.com) Home With Google Home, Amazon’s Echo voice assistant and home automation tool finally has a competitor. Home is a connected speaker equipped with microphones that listens for queries or commands and either responds with pertinent information or connects with the web and other smart devices to carry out tasks. Home isn’t particularly different, in theory, from Echo. They both seem to do well at the same types of things. Where Home, like Google’s other products, is unique is the integration with Google services, like YouTube and Google Play Music. Home can send audio out to network Google Cast (Chromecast) devices for playback throughout the home. ST. CLOUD TIMES Putting smart devices in the home Home also connects with Google’s deep search and query technology, which could only be a bonus when considering the capabilities of smart devices. Amazon has this space blanketed with options, ranging from the $180 full Echo to the $50 Echo Dot. Google is asking $130 for Home, so it’s cheaper than the main Echo, but not the smaller Dot. At launch, Home is a little light on third-party partners, but I expect this to be a short-term problem. The Internet of Things needs interoperability to grow, so don’t be surprised if Home gains more partners soon. Chromecast Ultra can stream 4K and is compatible with HDR televisions.  (Photo: Google, google.com/chromecast/tv/ultra/) Chromecast Ultra Just after Roku introduced a $79 4K-compatible streaming box last week, Google has countered with an even cheaper alternative. Called Chromecast Ultra, the $69 device costs twice as much as the original Chromecast, but is faster and adds 4K video playback support from Netflix, Vudu and YouTube. Ultra also supports HDR for compatible televisions and services. In addition to the speed and supported resolution bumps, Ultra features an Ethernet port in its power adapter, making wired connections possible for users that want extra network speed or stability. Ultra will be compatible with Google Home, so users will be able to control aspects of the casting experience through voice commands. Look for Chromecast Ultra in November.

On Tuesday, the company announced a buzzed-about phone, Pixel, and launched preorders for Google Home, its answer to a central question in the smart home biz: How do we get all these disparate doodads to communicate with one another seamlessly and elegantly? Now it’s muscling into more smart home territory with Google Wifi, which aims to improve consumers’ at-home wireless internet strength and reliability. While the arrival of Google Home is a direct challenge to the Amazon Echo and its "Alexa" voice-activated operating system (which has won a fair number of fans since its release in the U.S. in June of last year and is sure to win some new U.K. fans as well now that it’s available there, too), Google Wifi is angling for territory dominated by smaller companies like San Francisco’s Eero, whose Wi-Fi boosting system has been well-reviewed. Eero rivals like Plume, which starts shipping in November, have more to worry about, too. Even the sleek, white body of the Google Wifi units (over at Circuit Breaker, the gadget blog run by our sister site, the Verge, the units’ shape and smoothness were likened to a hockey puck), is reminiscent of Eero, which has more of a rounded-square shape but a similar aesthetic. Google Wifi, which will retail for $129 a unit (or $299 for a triple pack) when it starts arriving on consumers’ doorsteps in December. Like nearly all home tech products, you’ll be able to interface with Google Wifi via a smartphone app (perhaps from your new Pixel?).

What about Google Justice Gautam Patel was left flummoxed on why Google India Ltd was also made a defendant party in the suit by Go Holdings Pvt Ltd and quipped tongue-in-cheek that it was good that the petitioner was not seeking that the online giant also change its name to ‘ogle’. “For reasons that are presently unclear so far, Google India Ltd, the 2nd Defendant, is also said to be liable. “Advocate Amit Jamsandekar for the plaintiff grants that this is not because the word ‘Go’ is also part of Google’s corporate and domain name. “That is all to the good, for the alternative is unthinkable — we might otherwise be forced to ogle the Web,” Justice Patel quipped. Court directive The court directed the defendants to file their reply affidavits and the plaintiff to file its rejoinder to the affidavits by January 31 next year. The Wadia group-led GoAir challenged the use of the word ‘Go’ in the domain name goindigo.in. “The suit has not challenged the use of the word ‘Go’ in the trailing; a small mercy as it happens, for that might be a demand that IndiGo should be rechristened ‘Indi’,” Justice Patel noted in his order on October 3.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Pixel’s momentum may result with Google shipping its own processors By John Hoff - October 6, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We need to understand just how big launching the Pixel smartphone is for Google. This is the first smartphone that the company has actually produced from its own hardware division, with the manufacturing covered by HTC. But this is a Google brand now and it has the company managing inventory, sourcing out components, managing distribution – things that they’ve never done with the Nexus program. What will this mean for Google in the long term? There’s no way to tell that yet, but they might be planning to go deeper into hardware – maybe even producing their own processors. Dave Burke, VP for Android Engineering is happy with how the majority of the creation process of the Pixel was done by Google. He said that with Pixel, “we started from the beginning.” Burke adds that this would have never happened with Nexus, and we believe him in that. But where will it end? Burke thinks that the company will eventually be able to ship its own custom “silicon” if the momentum from Pixel keeps moving forward. Off the bat, observant tech pundits should be able to see that there is an intentional effort to do what Apple is doing with the iPhone – a set of self-developed, self-produced hardware that no partner can make or manufacture as good as they can themselves. This means that Google will have to dive into the world of hardware, and they’re at the deep end of that now – creating accessories, cables, and cases. But it might even reach the point of – as Apple is doing – putting out their own processors for their devices. Now, how soon we can expect that to happen – there is no telling yet. The pricing of the Pixel smartphones seem to be a challenge that Google needs to hurdle to make it big on the hardware side on their first try. But if the momentum is strong enough that Google can make second and third versions of the Pixel, a custom processor or chipset from Google might not be too far away.

Apple has struggled in the cloud for much of the past decade while its competitors — basically every big name: Amazon, Google, Microsoft — have managed to create successful services or hosting platforms. Apple is now hoping to pick up the pace, according to Bloomberg, in part by moving all of its cloud service teams together under one roof. Apple has been perpetually behind Google on cloud services That'll mean having the iCloud, Siri, Apple News, Apple Pay, and Maps teams, as well as parts of the iTunes and Apple Music teams, all at the Infinite Loop campus, rather than spread across multiple smaller sites, according to Bloomberg. One can question how much putting people in the same building can cure years of sluggish development, but Apple apparently thinks it'll speed things up and guard against buggy software. Perhaps more consequentially, Apple is also taking steps toward taking over the hosting of its cloud services, which are currently handled in part by Amazon and Google, according to Bloomberg. It's reportedly developing software, called Pie, meant to put all of its services in a single place; it's also said to be developing a photo storage system that Apple could host on its own. That might be a big help for Apple. Where Amazon and Google both offer limitless cloud storage options for photos, Apple charges its customers for anything beyond the bare minimum. It's led to real usability issues on both the iPhone and the Mac — we wrote yesterday about the iCloud pricing problem, and I discussed it extensively in my review of macOS Sierra, too. Apple getting it together in the cloud isn't simply a matter of bugs, it's likely also a matter of lowering costs so that it can match competitors' compelling offerings.

Google opens computer science lab in Oakland for young people of color Posted Oct 6, 2016 by Megan Rose Dickey (@meganrosedickey) 0 SHARES Next Story OpenStack’s latest release focuses on scalability and resilience Google is officially unveiling Code Next, its computer science lab for youth, today in Oakland. The program, which USA Today’s Jessica Guynn got wind of last month, is designed to offer young black and Latino people interested in tech an opportunity to learn how to code, as well as the fundamentals of computer science. That’s because 51% of black students and 47% of Latino students in the U.S. don’t have access to computer science classes in school, according to a study conducted by Google in partnership with Gallup. Code Next will work with 70 eighth-grade students in Oakland and 70 at its location in Harlem, which is set to open in 2017. Until then, students in New York will able to attend classes at Google’s NYC headquarters. Through Code Next’s curriculum, which was developed in partnership with MIT Media Lab, students will be able to learn how to code, participate in hands-on activities and expose themselves to computer language processing in after-school and weekend programs. The curriculum is includes core math skills necessary for coding, engineering design and leadership development. The program is free to attend, but students must be nominated by their schools and non-profit organizations like Black Girls Code. “We want to get them to a point where they are competent, comfortable and champions in the coding space so that if they choose to get qualified in CSAP, they will be able to do that, which will help facilitate their trajectory relative to college,” MIT Media Lab’s Topper Carew told me. Located near the Fruitvale Bay Area Rapid Transit station in Oakland, Code Next aims to be easily accessible to students from east and west Oakland, Google Student Experience Program Manager April Alvarez told me. “As this idea was coming into fruition, we were looking at the ideal cities and neighborhoods where we were going to position ourselves,” Alvarez said. In Oakland, we thought about Fruitvale because thee’s an ecosystem of partners there committed to CS but also people disconnected from the tech industry.” cod enext code next  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Google’s local partner is The Unity Council, a non-profit organization that focuses on improving the lives, economic conditions, educational opportunities, and health and safety of people in low-income communities. Every year, the organization reaches about 8,000 people in Oakland and Concord. “We’re taking a place-based approach,” Alvarez said. “We’re in the backyard of Silicon Valley and we wanted to make sure we didn’t ask students to leave their community in order to access these opportunities.” Related Articles Oakland-based art and tech studio 💾🌵 takes critical look at A.I. Y Combinator announces basic income pilot experiment in Oakland Salesforce expands $22.5M education investments to Oakland The silver lining of Google's diversity efforts In order to ensure Google would have a positive impact on the community, the company went into this with a community-centric approach, Alvarez said. Google conducted a listening tour and hosted a design hackathon with the community. “We made sure we were designing with the community versus for the community,” Alvarez said. “We’ve had a positive reception and i think it’s because they understand Code Next is about the community and the kids we’re working with.” Code Next will support the students through high school and help them get into college. Once they graduate from college, students will have the choice to opt in to the tech industry if they want to. “These kids will definitely be set up to work at Google and will be highly competitive applicants,” Alvarez said. “They will also be set up to start their own companies — to start their own next Facebook or Apple.” And the tech industry, which is notoriously white, could definitely use them. At Google, for example, black people make up just 2% of the employee population while Hispanics make up 3%, according to Google’s latest diversity report. Those numbers, unfortunately, are pretty much comparable with diverse representation of employees at the average tech company in Silicon Valley.

How to Add a ‘Hidden Room’ to Your Home” to “8 Really Creepy Secret Rooms Found in Houses” to “5 Scariest Secret Rooms Ever Discovered.” After Googling this topic, it took a concerted effort of the will to pull myself out of the YouTube wormhole into which I eventually plunged. I didn’t link to the last two titles here in order to spare you the click-bait experience. You’re welcome. If you really want to watch the videos, you can, well, Google them. There’s a significant market for adding secret spaces to homes. Tellus Build is a construction, renovation and design company with experience developing secret rooms for clients. Brett Riordan, senior vice president of construction, explains that people have a variety of reasons for wanting to install secret rooms, such as for use as “a jewelry safe, gun safe, or safe room in case of emergency.” He adds, “Other times it can be as simple as wanting to create an accent wall where a closet door exists, and not wanting to see the door and hardware.” Someone might also want a private office, collection room, home theater, “man cave,” etc. How Do You Create a Secret Room? You can create a secret room on your own or hire a company that specializes in this type of work. Riordan explains that a more basic project would be converting a closet into a secret room by changing the door and properly concealing it: “A simple solution for a small secret room is taking an old closet and removing the existing door and jamb, then installing a solid core metal door (with pivot door hardware) in its place. You can then use tile or any finish desired to cover the wall and secret door from corner to corner. The pivot door hardware is critical, as the door will be heavy after brick, tile, and/or desired finishes are applied. The pivot door hardware will require you to cut into the slab several inches to accommodate the closer hardware, and the same recess will need to be provided above. Rixson typically sells the best closer or pivot hardware. Clients should plan ahead and think the usage through, as this can be a costly project.” Besides closets and larger rooms, wall safes are common ways to conceal items. While you can have it hidden in any way you want as long as you’re willing to pay for it, bookcases are one of the most popular types of secret doors. Several different kinds are available, such as a single door that swings in or out, double doors that swing out and sliding doors. Fireplaces, cabinets and mirrors are other common options for hiding a secret entry. It’s surprisingly difficult to find photos of actual secret spaces that people have built – or maybe that’s not surprising, considering the “secret” aspect. However, as you check out the links throughout this article, you’ll find several videos that do show how some companies and individuals have constructed secret spaces. How Much Does It Cost? Ah, the million-dollar question. These types of projects get expensive very quickly. Riordan explains, “A full concrete bunker with climate control and secure ‘secret access’ could run you a minimum of $30k and up depending on size, etc. If you utilize an existing closet and create a wall-to-wall ‘hidden door’ for, say, a ten foot wall, you would be looking at $5k to $8k, depending on finishes, etc.” Creative Home Engineering specializes in building and installing secret doors. The cheapest product in the 2015 Pricing Estimates document on the company’s website is a wall mirror that doubles as a door, starting at $2,500. The double slider bookshelf starts at $15,000 and takes eight weeks to build and install. The company’s brochure highlights a number of the jobs they’ve done, ranging from hiding a wall vault behind a bookshelf to concealing a panic room behind an armoire, “Chronicles of Narnia”-style. These jobs were $7,500 and $40,000, respectively. If, however, you’re like me and don’t want to spend more on your secret room than you did on your car, the Murphy Door company is another option. They’ll provide you with custom solution, which can cost thousands of dollars, or you can order a standard-sized, unpainted and unassembled flush-mount bookshelf for $599 (before taxes). How Do You Keep It Secret? I wondered that, too, so I asked Riordan how to conceal the extra space from the outside so that it’s not obvious there is “missing” space in the home. “There are many ways to create the hidden element. If the question is how do you not notice the square footage of the room, that is considered in the planning and design stages of the build,” he said. “For example, if you had a fourth bedroom and framed in the door opening, if done correctly, no one would know the fourth bedroom existed.” How Should You Prepare for the Project? I also asked Riordan what important aspects people should consider before starting a project like this. How you’ll use the room is the most important consideration, he said, followed immediately by your budget. It’s also critical to do your own research about the products and finishes to make sure you understand what’s needed to meet your goal and that you get the proper materials, because, Riordan explains, “poor planning in the finish stage can leave you with a lackluster result, actually drawing one’s eye to the hidden room.” He advises, “Don’t cut corners, especially when it comes to the hardware chosen. Cheap hardware could create more sagging in the door or noise as the products settle in. Remember, the heavier you make the door, the stronger the components need to be to accommodate the weight. If you are looking to ventilate the space, make sure to plan accordingly (is ventilation even feasible in that space?). Oftentimes people don’t think of limitations in the design of the house … for instance, a structural beam could prevent you from running electrical or ventilation piping to the space. Think ahead!” Learning all about creating secret rooms and passages has gotten me excited to build one in my own home – and then I can share the process and pictures with you here! Just kidding. It wouldn’t be very secret if I did that, would it? If you, on the other hand, would like to share your experience building secret rooms and hidden spaces, post anonymously in the comments, and I promise to keep your secret safe.

It is believed to leave Salesforce, the American business software company, as the most likely buyer, reducing the likelihood of a bidding war for Twitter and raising the prospect of it not being bought at all.  Twitter’s shares fell by more than 18pc in early trading in New York, knocking $3.2bn (£2.5bn) off the company’s value, after Silicon Valley website Recode reported that Google and Disney would not be lodging formal bids. While neither company had confirmed they were considering offers, they were both believed to have appointed advisers to explore the option. Google, whose own efforts in social media have fallen flat, has long been rumoured to be interested in acquiring Twitter and was seen as the most likely buyer. Disney was seen as a less plausible candidate despite strong ties between its chief executive Bob Iger and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. Salesforce shares have fallen by around 4pc since rumours of the company's interest in buying Twitter emerged. It missed out on buying LinkedIn when Microsoft reached a $26bn deal to buy the professional social network earlier this year, and is believed to see potential in turning Twitter around. However, this week its chief executive Marc Benioff said: “We have to look at everything, but we’re going to pass on most things.” Jack Dorsey Credit: Bloomberg Twitter has struggled to live up to the lofty expectations generated by its early growth and the tremendous success of Facebook since it went public three years ago. It has not made a profit in its 10-year history and revenue growth has slowed dramatically in recent months. Though beloved of celebrities and other public figures, Twitter has failed to reach the user numbers enjoyed by Facebook or Instagram. Backers believe the influence it exerts across the media, the reams of data it generates and its position as a source of live news make Twitter valuable, but shares have more than halved since it floated.

Today we’re having a peek at some details shared by the Performance Lead on Pixel for Google, Tim Murray. Murray previously worked at NVIDIA as Tesla Software Engineer, Manager of Tesla Ecosystem Software, and Manager of NVIDIA’s CUDA Driver department. Why the glass and aluminum? As GPU compiler developer Fiora Eerieterna hypothesizes, Google likely chose the design of the back of the Pixel for thermal reasons. “TBH [the Nexus] 6P had good thermals,” said Murray, “but it was still A57 on 20nm and that’s rough… The thermals are good on [the Pixel]. Sorry internet.” Murray responded to a number of questions this week on the Pixel, including whether or not they had to clock the processor down at all (they didn’t) and how the heat from the processor does, indeed, leave the device. “Most of the back is aluminum,” said Murray, “also we just got a lot better at performance this year.” Asked whether improved thermals were in part due to the fact that this device does not have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, Murray replied, “that makes a big difference! EAS and deciding to rewrite a bunch of drivers and UI-critical stuff helps too.” For more information on EAS, have a peek at this AnandTech article. EAS stands for Energy Aware Scheduler. Performance Improvements According to Murray, the team behind performance improvement on this first wave of Pixel smartphones spent “most of the time” on performance consistency and touch latency. “Let’s just say it paid off,” said Murray. “I’m proud of a lot of things on that phone, but I’m most proud of the touch latency improvements by far.” Which is better, Pixel or Pixel XL? When asked about which of the two Pixel phones was “more powerful,” Murray said “they’re the same.” “Well, 1080p vs 1440p and battery size is different,” added Murray, “but other than that the same.” Pressed on how the larger display-toting smartphone could perform as well as the smaller, given its identical processor, Murray said, “It’s not really that simple because of thermal mass difference. … Larger battery plus higher thermal mass means it can clock more aggressively.” Stick around for more insight from the Google team and our review of the Pixel smartphone set coming up soon!

Google unveils new products including the Google Pixel Phone making a jump into the mobile device market. (Photo by Ramin Talaie/Getty Images) By Larry Magid | larry@larrymagid.com PUBLISHED: October 6, 2016 at 9:09 am | UPDATED: October 10, 2016 at 6:08 am Most of the attention at Google’s big press conference on Tuesday focused on several new hardware products, but I was more impressed with a software service called Google Assistant that runs on some of the new Google gadgets, and soon, other companies’ new hardware. Like other journalists at the press event, I was glad to get an early look at the two new Pixel smartphones, the new Google Home audio player and smart-home controller, the new WiFi hub, the virtual reality headset and the new Chromecast video streaming device. But what all of these products have in common is that – as good as they are – they’re iterations of other products from Google or its competitors. Yes, the phones are lovely and sport a great camera, but the same can be said for the iPhone 7, Galaxy S7 Edge and other high-end phones that – like Google’s new phones –cost $649 or more. Google WiFi looks really cool in that it enables you to put as many as you want in your house to create a “mesh network” so you’re always in range of a strong signal. But  Netgear and other companies have similar products, albeit at a higher price and without some of Google’s features and apparent ease of use. Roku, Apple and plenty of other companies have video streaming devices and Amazon’s popular Echo audio player/controller hit the market more than a year before the soon-to-be-released Google Home. At $129, Google Home is less expensive than the $180 full-featured Echo and, unlike the Echo, you can link multiple Google Home devices to have the same audio program available in different parts of your home. All of this is great and I congratulate Google’s hardware engineers on what promises to be great products. But what interested me the most about the Google announcement was not the hardware, but how Google plans to use its advanced software and its enormous “knowledge graph” to make this and other hardware deliver some astounding services. Google Assistant is basically an upgrade of its current Google Now or “OK Google” feature that’s available on Android devices. But it’s not only smarter but more context sensitive. In a promotional video shown at the event, the company pointed out that the original Google search was designed “so that everyone could find everything they need” among everything out there in the world. “But today,” it added, “it seems that sometimes it’s easy to feel like you need a little help with the stuff just in your own world.” So, Google Assistant is all about you – your schedule, your photos, your social activities, where you want to visit, where you want to eat, and so on. The context sensitive aspect of Google Assistant allows you to carry on a conversation much as you would with a person. For example, you could say “How long will it take to get to downtown San Francisco,” and after it tells you, you could ask “What restaurants are there.” You don’t have to repeat the name of the city any more than you would if you were having the conversation with a friend. At the press conference, Google VP Brian Rakowski showed how he and his wife planned an evening out. He started by using his voice to ask to see pictures taken last October and, when he saw a photo taken at the Greek Theater in Berkeley he asked Google Assistant what shows are coming up and it read him a list using its almost human sounding computerized voice. He picked a show and sent his wife a text about it and she responded yes and suggested a restaurant. The assistant brought up information about that restaurant and he used his voice to make a reservation. Again, because it was context sensitive he was able to do it as a conversation, “Make a reservation at Marzano for Friday,” he said, and it responded, by asking him how many people in his party followed by “and what time do you want to reserve.” Finally, the assistant said it had made the reservation and would follow up with an email. Google Assistant will run on a variety of hardware products, starting with Google’s new Pixel phones and Google Home but migrating to other devices throughout the Android eco-sphere and beyond. And, because Google’s enormous trove of information is available to its assistant, it should know something about just about every restaurant and venue in the known world. As you’d expect, Google assures us that the information gathered by Google Assistant will remain private, but that doesn’t stop me from being at least somewhat concerned that Google will now be amassing even more information about us. While you have to either press a button or say a keyword like “OK Google” to enable the assistant, there is no question that it is possible for Google to be listening to everything you’re saying just as it is with Amazon Echo, Microsoft Cortana, Apple’s “Hey Siri,” or any other voice enabled service that doesn’t necessarily require you to push a button to allow it to listen (although that is usually an option). Just because something is possible doesn’t mean it’s happening. I believe all these companies when they say that their devices are not listening until you say the trigger word. But it’s still one more thing to worry about, especially as this technology fans out from not just big public companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon, but to start-ups that may not have the ethics or technical know-how to limit what their devices are hearing and who they might be sharing that with.

To demonstrate, the company’s scientists showed videos featuring robotic arms whirling inside its labs. Google’s robotics group built those machines and wanted to sell them to manufacturers, warehouse operators and others. However, executives at Google parent Alphabet Inc nixed the plan because it failed chief executive officer Larry Page’s “toothbrush test,” a requirement that the company only ship products used daily by billions of people, according to people familiar with the situation. The verdict came at about the end of last year, just before the Google robotics unit moved to X, Alphabet’s research lab. Roboticists who worked on the project voiced frustration with Google’s caution, echoing sentiment at other divisions outside Google’s core Internet business, like its self-driving car unit, which display technical prowess, but have yet to ship products. “It was still a prototype, but it had a lot of advantages,” James Kuffner, chief technology officer at the Toyota Research Institute who previously led Google’s robotics unit, said about the arm. “The team worked really hard. If it had been entirely up to me I would have shipped it, but it was not.” Google spokesman Jason Freidenfelds said there are no plans to sell the machines. “We’re using them to do basic research on how machine learning might help robots be a bit more coordinated — a promising field of research, but still very early days,” Freidenfelds said. Courtney Hohne, a spokeswoman for Alphabet’s X, declined to comment. Google built about 50 of the robotic arms capable of lifting about 4.5kg each, according to one person familiar with the project. They were designed by Meka Robotics, a start up Google acquired in 2013, according to another person. The unreleased arm is another sign of trouble at Google’s rudderless robotics division. A slew of start-ups joined in 2013, thanks to an acquisition spree by former Android chief Andy Rubin. He left the following year and Google ported the robotics teams into X for a reboot. Earlier this year, Google moved to sell the largest of these groups, Boston Dynamics, after tensions arose internally. Google has not sold the unit. When Google considers releasing a product, it has to protect its brand, which is among the most valuable in the world, Kuffner said. “There’s risk associated with something that could be sub-par,” he added. “No executive is going to get it right all the time. It’s a hard balance and a hard line to walk because on the one hand you want to launch and ship early, but on the other hand you want to protect your brand.” Although Alphabet abandoned shipping the robotic arms, it has not put them to rest completely. Its latest papers, a collaboration between researchers at several Alphabet units, demonstrate a groundbreaking technique called “collective learning” applied to robotics. After the fleet of arms were trained on Google’s algorithms to open a certain type of door, for instance, they were able to replicate the action with doors they had never seen before. “The skills learned by the robots are still relatively simple — pushing objects and opening doors,” the researchers wrote, “but by learning such skills more quickly and efficiently through collective learning, robots might in the future acquire richer behavioral repertoires that could eventually make it possible for them to assist us in our daily lives.” This story has been viewed 1298 times.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 6 October 2016 | MYT 11:56 PM Twitter shares plunge on report bidders are scarce This file photo taken on Nov 7, 2013 shows a banner with the logo of Twitter on the front of the New York Stock Exchange. - AFP pic NEW YORK: Twitter shares plunged on Thursday, a day after technology website Recode reported that Alphabet’s Google and Disney would not bid for the social network and Apple was unlikely to be a suitor. The company has requested binding acquisition bids within the next two weeks, Reuters reported on Wednesday, and hopes to wrap up sale negotiations before the end of the month. Google was a likely contender for the microblogging service, Recode reported, but those familiar with the deal said the company was not moving forward with an effort to buy Twitter at this time. Twitter’s shares fell as much as 19.2% to US$20.10, valuing the company at about US$14.2bil. They were last down 17.2% at US$20.60. Salesforce.com Inc is now left as the only potential buyer, Recode said, although the cloud-software maker has not confirmed publicly that it wants to make a bid. Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff told CNBC on Wednesday that Twitter was “an exciting product, but obviously the business has a lot of challenges.” The rationale for Salesforce bidding on Twitter is not clear, said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a note to clients. Buying Twitter would reduce the value of Salesforce shares by about US$11 through dilution, while increased debt could cut another US$9.50 from the stock. Salesforce’s shares were up 3.6% at US$70.90 on Thursday. Other potential bidders beyond Salesforce are taking a look at Twitter, CNBC said, citing sources. And Google might not be out of the running entirely, said Patrick Moorhead, analyst from Moor Insights & Strategy. “I think Google needs Twitter and Twitter needs Google. Google has failed multiple times to create a compelling social media platform and they need a company like Twitter,” Moorhead said. “I do not think this is the end of it. This is more likely Google trying to send a message to Twitter that ‘your terms are too rich.’”  Twitter has told potential acquirers it wants to conclude negotiations about selling itself by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct 27. The timeline is ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. The company, run by Jack Dorsey, has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit despite having about 313 million average monthly active users. Twitter missed Wall Street sales expectations in the first and second quarters of 2016 and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company. Up to Wednesday’s close, Twitter’s stock had fallen nearly 12% in the last 12 months, but had risen by about a third since reports emerged in September that the company was in talks with Salesforce. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Technology , Twitter Related Stories Twitter beats estimates, cuts jobs with eye on 2017 profitability Twitter sale process reportedly almost dead Twitter to start talks with potential buyers Top Twitter executives to leave company in reshuffle Tough turnaround for Twitter You May Be Interested Higher profile for AWC, order book hits RM1.2bil Bank Negara takes on currency speculators CMSB plans to use used tyres as alternative fuel for clinker production Trading ideas: IOI Properties, CAM, IHH, WCT Diary Malaysia 2016 Corporate Earnings Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Najib: Contact High Commission if affected by NZ earthquake Raonic shrugs off injury concerns with impressive victory Rynet Malaysia offers training for PHP certification Property Related advertisement Latest News Fitch: Most Asian Telcos to Come Under Pressure in 2017 Most Asian telcos to come under pressure in 2017 Diary Malaysia 2016 Corporate Earnings Foreign funds net sellers at RM800m in week ended Nov 11 Malaysian palm oil/Vegoils: Market factors to watch Monday Nov 14 Most Viewed in Business Ringgit jumps against US$ early Monday Bank Negara takes on currency speculators Trump's election win not good news for Malaysian chipmakers Bank Negara’s audacious move to tame offshore market Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Picture: Dumisani Sibeko Nairobi - Veteran Kenyan radio journalist, Waweru Mburu, was the most trending search term in Kenya in September. Mburu, who was the Head of Radio Citizen at Royal Media Services, died on September 28 at MP Shah Hospital while undergoing treatment for gastric cancer. Google search trends released by Google in Kenya show that the second trending search was the late politician, William ole Ntimama. His family said he died of natural causes on September 2, at the age of 86. Third on the list was South African Kwaito artist Mandoza – real name Mduduzi Tshabalala – after he died on September 18 at the age of 38 while undergoing treatment for a brain tumour. Fourth on the list of trending searches was Kenya’s nominated Chief Justice, David Maraga, after the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) announced in September that Justice Maraga, 65, had emerged the best of eleven candidates shortlisted for the Chief Justice position. The position fell vacant after former Chief Justice Dr Willy Mutunga retired in June. Solar Eclipse was the fifth trending search after an annular solar eclipse occurred on September 1. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the sun for a viewer on earth. Other trending searches were Kenya Airports Authority employee, Ken wa Mwangi, after his controversial Facebook post about his alleged sexual encounters with underage girls enraged Kenyans online; Trey Songz, after the American RB icon visited Kenya for the recording of the fourth edition of the Pan African music show, Coke Studio Africa; US Presidential Debate as people went online to learn more about the first debate between American presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald trump which took place on September 27. Veteran Kenyan radio journalist, Waweru Mburu, was the most trending search term in Kenya in September. SUPPLIED Other trending searches were Jubilee Party launch as Kenyans went online to find out more about the launch of the political party that brought together more than 10 000 delegates from varied parts of the country. People also turned to Google search to find answers to their questions, including “What is constipation?” which was the most trending question, followed by “what is Kimoji?” as people turned to search to learn more about the mobile app that features a series of Kim Kardashian’s images as emoticons. Other “what” searches were: “what is liver Cirrhosis?”, “what is the cure for heartburn?”, “what is parsley called in Swahili?”, “what is the meaning of ‘bae’?”, “what is the normal blood pressure?”, “what is Eid al-Adha?”, “what is emphysema?” and “what is gambling?”. In the “How to” category, the most trending search was “how to cook fish”, followed by “how to gain weight fast”, and also “how to praise a lady”. Other trending “how to” searches were “How to massage a newborn”, “How to get a clear face”, “How to marinate pork”, “how to bake mandazi”, “How to tell if a girl likes you” and “How to start a small business”.

Don't Hold Your Breath Henry T. Casey Staff Writer Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)October 6, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share To paraphrase a certain soup-slinger: No Assistant for you! A leaked and confirmed document detailing the different features coming to the Pixel handsets and all other Android 7.1 Nougat devices shows that Google Assistant is limited to the company's flagship phones for the time being. The Pixel and Android differences leaked in a changelog published on Tuesday (Oct. 4) by Android Police that Google confirmed in a conversation with TechCrunch yesterday (Oct. 5). While Pixel handsets will no longer see the Google Now service (it's getting folded into Assistant), Android devices not "made by Google" will likely be stuck with Google Now. Android users eager to use and play with Assistant can still find it inside of apps such as the messaging client Allo (downloads of which have plummeted as of late). MORE: 40 Best Free Android Apps Other Pixel-exclusive features include Smart Storage, which automatically removes backed-up photos and videos when storage runs low and 24x7 phone and chat customer support. Pixel phones will also be the only Android handsets to get camera features such as Electronic Image Stabilization and Smartburst, both of which Google demoed at its Tuesday (Oct. 4) event and appear to be major advantages for those capturing smooth video and precise snapshots, respectively. Google Pixel buyers will also be the only to get the packed-in Quick Switch Adapter, the company's hardware accessory that makes it easy to import all of your content from an iPhone or other Android device. Pixel users will also be the only to get the Pixel Launcher interface, with its pill-shaped Google widget and swipe-up apps tray. Industrious Android users can find a way to get Pixel Launcher, though, as it's been available to sideload since September. Pixel handsets will also be the only smartphones to get unlimited backup of original-quality photos and videos to Google Photos.  MORE: Google Pixel Hands-on: Beating Siri at Her Own Game A lack of unlimited, original-quality backups to Google photos latter may not be the biggest deal for most users, as Google Photos presently allows for unlimited backup of images with resolution of up to 16 megapixels, and most flagship Android devices are cut off at 12-MP shooting. Unfortunately, Google Photos' free unlimited backup limits video resolution to 1080p, and many phones, including Samsung's Galaxy S7 handsets, can shoot 4K videos. Read More But what exactly can users of non-Google-made Android devices look forward to? When 7.1 Nougat reaches those devices, they'll get access to Daydream Virtual Reality and Night Light, which is similar to iOS's Night Shift, as it reduces the blue light emitted by a Android's display, a feature used by those looking for any solution to fall asleep easier. While we could see Samsung and other smartphone makers figure out ways to replicate the above list of exclusives, this laundry list of exclusives should be enough to make users give the Pixels a serious look, if they haven't already.

Another claim is the camera shutter speed will make it the fastest on the market. There are three colour options available; very silver, quite black or really blue.

Android 7.1 will debut in Google’s upcoming Pixel smartphones, and it’s centered around Google Assistant, an artificially intelligent bot that acts like a personalized, enhanced version of Google Now. Related: Hands on: Google Pixel and Pixel XL Google announced several new products at its October 4 event in San Francisco, including the Pixel, Pixel XL, Daydream View, Chromecast Ultra, and more. Google Assistant, which debuted on the messaging app Allo in September, will soon be in two other surfaces: the Pixel smartphones and the search giant’s $130 Amazon Echo-competitor, Google Home. It’s safe to say it’s a core part of the company’s future. But Assistant is not coming to other Android devices in the 7.1 update, at least not in the near future. In fact, Pixel smartphones have their own unique Android experience, much like how a Samsung phone has its own features compared to an LG phone. Still, there is a decent amount to be excited about in 7.1. Here’s everything you need to know. When is 7.1 Nougat launching? If you want the latest and greatest Google and Android have to offer, you can pre-order a Pixel or Pixel XL from Google’s website and Verizon. They will ship with the Pixel-exclusive features and Android 7.1 toward the end of the month. Android 7.1 Nougat launched in developer preview as part of Android Beta Program on October 20. “We’re continuing the model we used in N and earlier releases,” Google announced in a blog post. “We’re delivering the initial Developer Preview at beta quality for the Nexus lineup of devices.” Fair warning, though, that the developer preview isn’t free of bugs: Google notes that some users might encounter “instability,” “higher than expected” battery drain, and other issues. Devices enrolled in the beta will receive the Android N developer preview “automatically.” Alternatively, it’s available for manual download and installation from the Android developer website. Unfortunately, the beta is only available for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and the Pixel C tablet. Google said support will be added for other devices “in November” followed by Android N’s final public release. The final release will come in December to the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C, supported Android One devices, and the Pixel and Pixel XL. It’s unclear when carriers and other manufacturers will roll out the update, but do not expect it to be anytime soon. Hardly any Android devices are running Android 7.0 Nougat. What’s coming in 7.1 Nougat? It may seem like non-Pixel users are getting the short end of the stick — particularly with the lack of Assistant-integration. Still, there are quite a few new features in the Android version update. Notably, App Shortcuts are back. The feature was briefly introduced during the Android Nougat beta program, but was scrapped. It mimics the 3D Touch features introduced in iOS 9 — press and hold an app icon to quickly jump into specific actions. Pixel Launcher supports the API, and more app developers will be able to for smartphones running Android 7.1. Apps can have up to five shortcuts, according to the Android Developers website. A new restart setting has joined the power menu. Now, when you press and hold the power button on the Nexus 5X or Nexus 6P, you will have the option of power cycling the phone instead of switching it off. A new Moves menu in settings includes a number of toggle actions you can initiate by gesture. You can launch the camera by pressing the power button twice, for instance, or switch in and out of selfie mode by double-twisting your wrist when you are in the app. And you can life your phone to quickly check your notifications. Image Keyboard support also allows developers to allow people to send content directly from the keyboard, like stickers, emojis, GIFs, and more. It is unclear if this will be supported in Google Keyboard. Among those emojis are 100 additions the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee, the industry consortium that oversees the approval of new keyboard characters, approved in July. They comprise 11 new professions available in both genders and various skin tones and ethnicities, and new female and male versions of 33 existing emoji. Related: Goodbye, Google Cast! App gets rebranded as the more inclusive Google Home A lead Pixel engineer tweeted that the devices have improved touch latency — which is also confirmed in the changelog. This means the delay from tapping the screen to receiving a response is likely much smaller than before — a feature iOS and iPhones have particularly excelled at. For the average user, though, it may hardly be noticeable. The very nature of how Android updates and  installed are also different. Updates will install similarly to the process run in Chromebooks — they are installed in the background automatically on a separate partition. When your device restarts, it swaps partitions so you can use the new updated version. Daydream VR mode is also supported in the update, as well as circular app icons, like the ones on the Pixel smartphones. A new Android on the Pixel Nougat on Google’s Pixel smartphones looks slightly different in comparison to other Android phones, like Google’s Nexus lineup. For starters, the notification drawer is black and the brightness slider is blue, as opposed to grey and a teal blue slider on Nexus devices. These color changes are meant to accent the Pixel with Google colors, and that includes the white, filled in navigation buttons. The Settings menu also features a similar black color accent, but you will immediately notice something new — you can swipe left to a new tab to access Google’s support team. You can start a phone call, or a live chat to resolve any issues you have with the device. There is also a screen-share option that lets the support representative look at your phone to make things a little easier. These support features are not included in Nougat 7.1. Pixel Launcher is also tied to the Pixel for now, and it includes a swipe feature to access the app drawer, a new search and voice search icon, the date and weather on the home page, and a dynamic calendar date icon. The latter changes the date on the Google Calendar icon to match with the actual date. There is also a wallpaper picker that improves the process of setting your wallpaper, along with adding more options. Google rebuilt the camera experience for the Pixels from the ground up and so to entice consumers to try it out, Pixel owners will be able to back up the full resolution of their photographs and videos to Google Photos for free. This was already an option in the Photos app, but it would eat up storage in your Google account. Tying into the free back up feature, Smart Storage works in the background and automatically removes old backed up photos and videos from your device to clear up space. These are still backed up to the Photos cloud, so you do not have to worry about losing them. Related: The battle of the entry-level headsets: Google’s Daydream View vs. Samsung’s Gear VR Speaking of photos and videos, the electronic image stabilization demoed at the event will be exclusive to the Pixel as well. This is a new video stabilizing method Google built into the Pixel’s cameras, and it offers smoother video playback. According to a changelog posted by Android Police, there are several Pro features from the Pixel camera that are not included in 7.1 as well — white balance presets, exposure compensation, Automatic Exposure and Automatic Focus locking, and viewfinder grid modes. Smartburst, which takes multiple photos and selects the best one, and hardware-accelerated HDR+ image processing are also only available on the Pixel. Because the Pixel smartphones are “made by Google,” they allow for tighter hardware and software integration — similar to how well iOS is integrated with the iPhone’s internals. An Android Sensor Hub processor in Google’s Pixels feature “tightly integrated sensors,” including the accelerometer, gyroscope, cell, GPS, Wi-Fi connectivity, and more. Part of that integration manifests in a night mode. Initially mentioned as a part of Android 7.1 but omitted from the Android Developers website, it is another feature that was dropped during the beta program of Nougat. Officially called Night Light, it removes blue tints from your smartphones screen at night to reduce the risks associated with the exposure before bedtime. Google said that it is tied to graphics hardware, meaning devices without explicit support — including Nexus devices — will not be seeing it anytime soon. Fingerprint gestures are on the way as well. You will be able to swipe down your finger on the sensor to pull down the notification shade, and swipe up to close it. These gestures will be opt-in. Packaged in the box is a Quick Switch adapter, which makes transferring data from an iPhone to the Pixel easy and fast. The setup process for the Pixel also features a new look. But the biggest Pixel feature that is not coming to Android 7.1 is Google Assistant. It is tightly integrated with Pixel — just press the home button to activate the AI bot. You can ask it to help you with almost everything, from ordering an Uber to playing a song on YouTube, and more. A Google Pixel lead engineer tells Digital Trends that Google is “exploring” ways to bring Assistant to other Android devices, but it may take a while or may never even see the light of day. “Our goal is to make the Google Assistant widely available to users, and we’ll continue to launch new surfaces over the course of the next year,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch.

IHS sees smartphone VR headsets representing 87% of the market’s installed base by the end of 2016.   RELATED: Google Unveils Daydream View VR Headset, Controller   On the mobile side, IHS expects the Gear VR to have the largest installed base of all major branded headsets with 5.4 million this year, but expects the Daydream View to “slowly disrupt Samsung’s dominant market position” and become the most popular headset for VR by 2019.   RELATED: 360 Video: VR’s Path to the Mainstream   IHS also expects consumers to spend $1.6 billion on VR headsets this year, bolstered by more expensive platforms like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Sony PS VR.   “Smartphone VR headsets will represent the largest addressable market for VR content because of cheaper pricing,” Ian Fogg, senior director at IHS Technology, said in a statement. “The smartphone VR base will be a major opportunity for VR content experimentation   “Smartphone VR headsets’ share of the VR installed base will be 87 percent at the end of 2016.”   However, the firm also expects higher-end VR headsets to dominate content monetization, with IHS predicting that consumer spending on VR entertainment will hit $3.3 billion by 2020, up from a mere $310 million in 2016.   RELATED: PlayStation VR Lands on October 13   “There will be a polarization of the VR market between lower volume premium VR headsets, which will have strong paid content conversion rates, and higher-volume cheaper smartphone VR headsets, which will monetise content at a lower rate,” Piers Harding-Rolls, director of games analysis at IHS Technology, noted. “A $3.3 billion VR entertainment market by 2020 will represent less than 1 percent of overall entertainment spending worldwide.”   Want to read more stories like this?

The new headset is a bit different from some of its rivals that are already available. The biggest difference is that Google wanted it to feel more like an article of clothing and not a clunky piece of technology. It was able to achieve that by making the headset out of fabric instead of hard plastic. Google has now provided the list of VR titles which will arrive after the headset is released next month. The company has updated its Daydream View page to reveal 30 titles which are in development and will eventually be released after the headset starts shipping to customers. It talked about some of them during its announcement a couple of days ago. You can check out the entire list on Google’s Daydream View blog. You won’t be able to use just about any Android smartphone with this handset. It will only work with those that are compatible with Google’s Daydream VR platform. Currently, the only two phones that work with this handset are the Pixel and Pixel XL made by Google. Google is giving out Daydream View headsets as a pre-order incentive to Pixel customers. It hasn’t provided a confirmed release date as yet for the headset but did say during the announcement that it costs $79 and will be released in November. Filed in Gadgets.

It has developed in baby steps since its unveiling a year ago at the Mountain View, California-based company’s I/O developer conference, when it debuted in the form of a woven fabric patch. Now a veritable platform more than a year later, Jacquard has seemingly captured the attention of Google’s brightest minds, and the firm has just filed a patent with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office for a “gesture control system” designed to work with so-called smart garments. The patent in question is focused on “interactive textiles” — in other words, jackets, caps, jerseys, purses, shirts, and other bits of clothing able to recognize touch-based gestures — and, more specifically, means of input. A swipe along the collar of a connected shirt, for instance, could pause a video playing on television, while repeated taps on a capacitive kneepad could mute a stereo. The potential’s endless, really: a handbag tap could launch a digital Macy’s catalog; a hat swipe could download the newest issue of GQ; and a glove gesture could set a connected home thermostat to a toasty predefined temperature. Related: Google just reinvented motion control and the fabric in our clothes The conceit of Project Jacquard is simple enough: weaving touch-sensitive components into fabrics using conventional textile manufacturing processes. But achieving that vision took 10 months of intensive research. Engineers had to design custom yarn that could withstand the pulling and heating of the weaving process. They had to develop touch-sensitive threads that could detect the swipes, strokes, and taps of multiple fingers at once, and that could be woven into a patch by a loom. And they had to settle on a means of producing them at scale. A year later, though, they achieved their vision in the form of a Project Jacquard garment bound for brick-and-mortar stores. It’s called the Commuter, and it’s a denim jacket produced in partnership with Levi. Google’s tech assumes the form of a cuff strap: once strapped firmly to the jacket, the wearer can swipe across it or tap it to perform actions like pinning a location to Google Maps, answering a phone call, or dismissing text message. In the near future, it’ll be capable of far more: Google intends to release Jacquard’s API for use by third-parties such as Spotify and Strava. Perhaps not coincidentally, Google’s patent filing comes as Levi preps for a beta test of the Commuter jacket. “We committed to introducing a product this year and we’re excited to have working production samples that developers can use to help build our initial prototypes,” Paul Dillinger, vice president of global product innovation at Levi’s, told Wareable. “This is invisible technology and discrete, intuitive gestures that have the potential to change our relationship with clothing. [We’re] very excited for our consumers to try this out … [and] to see how they respond to this new form of wearable technology.” With any luck, it won’t be long before the rest of us get to see it in action, too.

By Conner Forrest | October 6, 2016, 6:57 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Sarah Tew/CNET Samsung's acquisition of Viv Labs, announced Wednesday, could lead to the firm's development of its own AI-powered intelligent assistant. Viv was created, in part, by Dag Kittlaus, who also helped create Siri, which gained fame after its acquisition from Apple. The news of the acquisition came on the same day that Google announced its latest flagship smartphone, the Google Pixel phone. During its Made by Google event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai spoke of the company's future vision for computing and moving from a "mobile-first to AI-first" approach. Google's AI-first approach is built on its Google Assistant technology, which powers the Pixel phone and also works with its messaging app, Allo, and its Google Home smart home hub. Also, Apple seems to be moving to further integrate Siri into more of its products, working toward an AI-first future as well. SEE: Quick glossary: Artificial intelligence (Tech Pro Research) If you've been following the mobile space, especially the competition between Android and iPhone, you'd know that Samsung is one of the top OEM manufacturers of Android devices. So, if Google has built out its own assistant for use in that ecosystem, why wouldn't Samsung just use that? Because the launch of the Google Pixel phone, and of Google Assistant, has bigger implications for Google's mobile strategy, and Samsung knows it.

Before the Google Assistant, there was Google Now. While they have similar features, the Google Assistant is more full-featured and more contextual. Google Now is platform-agnostic, but the Google Assistant is exclusive to the new Pixel phone, at least for now. The problem with Samsung waiting on the potential availability of the Google Assistant is complex. With the increase in hardware commoditization, the next generation mobile experience will be defined by the contextual information provided by AI. Users won't care as much about what their phone can do, but rather what the software on their phone can do for them. The update cycle for Android devices is complicated, to say the least. After an update has been pushed by Google, there are carrier tests that sometimes need to happen (and Samsung has a lot of carrier partnerships) and the OEM itself often adds its own skin and features to the OS before pushing it to users. This can take a long time. But, Google devices like the Pixel phone, and the Nexus line before it, get the updates first. As AI begins to define more and more of the smartphone user's life, waiting on the whims of Google and other parties involved in the update process essentially makes Samsung a second-class citizen in the Android ecosystem. If Samsung wants to stay competitive in mobile, especially as a premium device manufacturer, they have to own the AI integration for their smartphones. Samsung has also always wanted to be a software player. This was seen in the company's S Voice and S Health apps, but the Viv integration could boost Samsung's software prowess. This also goes beyond the smartphone, as Samsung's CTO noted that the company plans to commercialize interfaces using Viv for its home appliances and wearable products as well. In that way, Samsung products that don't run Android will be able to utilize the same kind of "smarts." The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Samsung will acquire Viv Labs, an AI company that was founded by former Siri creator Dag Kittlaus. As Google moves to an AI-first vision of mobile, Samsung is looking to remain competitive with its own AI assistant, so it won't become a second class citizen in the Android ecosystem. Samsung CTO Injoing Rhee said that the company will commercialize the Viv interfaces, and they could end up on wearables and home appliances as well.

(AAPL) Stock View All Posts This week, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) was looking a lot like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) — not just because Alphabet stole the tech media’s attention with a highly anticipated event, but because that event was all about hardware. Arguably the biggest news to come out of the event was the company’s new smartphone, called the Pixel. This has been dubbed the first “real” Google phone, and I could spend an entire article discussing the pros and cons of its features. But that would be totally beside the point. Source: Google I’m not saying that because of the laundry list of other devices Google revealed either, which include a fashion-forward virtual reality headset, a smart home speaker, a Wi-Fi router and more. I’m saying it because GOOGL stock investors need to remember their north star. Don’t Forget What Makes and Breaks GOOGL Stock This tech behemoth may have its moonshots, but the end game — especially from a business perspective — is always the same. Whether we’re talking software or hardware, Google feeds on data. Remember, revenue from Google is, by and large, ad revenue. Ads, in this day and age, rely on targeting. And targeting relies on data. It’s no coincidence, then, that Alphabet is highlighting the AI capabilities of its individual products and the “Internet of Things” they together form. AI feeds on data just like ads do. While GOOGL may say it’s connecting disparate devices into one network for the sake of consumer convenience, and while Google may tout a “personalized experience” for each and every user, there’s a four-letter word at play here. I say four-letter word because, while Alphabet’s business may depend on data, questions around tracking and storage are already being raised in the wake of the company’s latest hardware announcements. This is important for GOOGL stock investors to realize. While there are plenty of specs to dissect — the phone, for instance, sports a 12.3 megapixel camera, can be powered for seven hours by a mere 15-minute charge, comes with unlimited cloud storage and more — the biggest question mark around the phone and other pieces of hardware is privacy. TechCrunch was especially critical of the “sweeping breadth of [Google’s] ambition to own consumer data” in an article called “Not OK, Google.” The article didn’t just look forward, but backward, noting that other products relying on AI (such as Google’s Allo messaging app) already pose privacy concerns. Bottom Line Consumers love convenience and have see-sawed toward it over privacy for some time. But conversations and questions about that opportunity cost continue to grow, and we could see a tipping point. Alphabet investors must remain aware of this narrative. Don’t let a hardware reveal distract you. Specs are cool, cameras are cool, VR is cool. But for GOOGL stock, it’s all about data. Consumers will have to continue being cool with that for any of these hardware products to gain traction.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeConsumerGoogle New Smartphone Announced; What’s At Stake? (GOOG) Google New Smartphone Announced; What’s At Stake? (GOOG) Google-parent Alphabet Inc recently launched its own-brand of smartphones, Pixel and Pixel XL. What is at risk? Plus, get to know more about the features of the search giant's new smartphones. October 6, 2016 WSP On Tuesday, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) launched its own-brand smartphones, risking its relationship with current hardware partners. Based on the latest statistics, four out of five smartphone users use Android, making it the leading smartphone operating system (OS) across the globe. Google, who is the creator of the said operating system held a hardware event on Tuesday where they launched their newest smartphones – the Pixel and Pixel XL , as part of a batch of new devices aimed at grabbing market share from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Along with these gadgets, Google also introduced “Google Home”, a voice-responsive “smart speaker”, a VR headset, Wi-Fi routers and the latest version of its Chromecast streaming device. Google’s Partnerships at Stake According to analysis firm IHS Markit, Android may not be as dominant as the search giant thinks. In relation to Google’s recently launched Pixel smartphone, industry analysts say there are many factors that can potentially hurt Google’s relationship with manufacturers that currently rely on the software. “We’re putting a stake in the ground for the Android ecosystem in terms of what we think is the best from both the software and hardware point of view, which has been developed and made by Google,” stated James Nugent, Pixel’s product manager. The newly-launched smartphones are Google’s first devices to carry their branding without being associated with another manufacturer. A few years back the Mountain View, Calif.-based company partnered with hardware manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and Huawei to incorporate its software into other devices in an attempt to showcase the viability of Android as the leading OS choice for smartphone users. With the new release of its own hardware, Google has followed in the footsteps of Apple in terms of creating its own ecosystem. This strategy besides putting Google’s relationship with current hardware partners at stake, marks also the beginning of the fight between the two tech giants for the top premium smartphone. Taking on Apple’s iPhone: A Quick Look at Google’s Pixel In an attempt to take on Apple’s iPhone, Google went as far as attacking iPhone’s storage capacity. The company did that by showing a ‘storage full’ message from an iPhone, something Google said its smartphones would avoid with unlimited full res photo and video (4K included) backup using Google Photos’ cloud storage. Google Pixel has a 5-inch screen while Pixel XL is a little bit wider at 5.5 inches, both with elegant aluminum bodies. Both the smartphones have Snapdragon 821, the latest processor from Qualcomm. They are also run by the most recent version of Android 7.1 Nougat. The Pixel smartphones have 12-megapixel cameras which were awarded a rating of 89 by DxOMark, a camera analyst of over 9000 cameras, lenses, and mobile phones. Thanks to their large 1.55 micrometre pixels that help enhance photos taken on low light. The Pixel’s camera is currently the highest ranked smartphone camera, surpassing Apple’s iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge with a ranking of 87 and 88 respectively. Another important Pixel feature is the new Google Assistant. Of course, it works just like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. The Google Assistant replaces Google voice search and Google Now which was previously available to other Android smartphones. Google Pixel (5-inch) and Pixel XL (5.5-inch ) are meant to be the most powerful and most unified Android phones ever. Both models come in three different color options: Very Silver, Quite Black and Really Blue and are the same price as the iPhone 7, starting at $649 for the small one and $769 for the big one, or you can pay monthly for $27 a month. The smartphones will be available from Verizon and unlocked through the Google Store. They will be compatible with all four major U.S. carriers, too, as well as Project Fi.

The mileage suggests that the development of autonomous vehicles may be progressing rapidly. Engineers are dealing now with the most difficult part of programming the vehicles — how to anticipate the unexpected, Google says.   The Google vehicles, for example, can now detect whether a moving object is a child or a bicycle and prepare for unpredictable movements, according to Reuters. The car's driving system calculates the probability of such movements to determine how it will react, according to Reuters. "You have to have a deeper understanding of what's on the road and to the side," Dmitri Dolgov, head of self-driving technology at Google, told Reuters. "Every time you drive, it's different." Those kinds of complex calculations and reactions are the most challenging element of autonomous-driving technology, Dolgov said. "You get to 90 percent autonomy in 10 percent of the time and then spend 90 percent of your time on the last 10 percent," he told Reuters.  The giant California-based company — a leader in the race to autonomy —is focused on making cars fully self-driving, meaning they will likely not have pedals or steering wheels.  View Comments Tags Autos Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Britta O'Boyle and Chris Hall20 October 2016Phone Pocket-lint Android 7.1 debuts on Pixel phones Android 7.1 dev beta started 19 October Final release for Nexus and Pixel is scheduled for early December Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Every year a major update to Android is released. This year's update is called Android Nougat, following the theme of dessert-inspired names. Unlike previous updates, Nougat was first released to developers with a public preview beta programme, meaning early access to the new version of Android. It's now been released to Nexus devices. If you want to know what the Nougat update brings with it, you can read our Android Nougat review with everything you need to know. Android 7.0 Nougat review: Subtle but super-sweet OS update Things are a little more complicated already in 2016, because Google subsequently launched the Pixel and Pixel XL devices on Android 7.1, bringing some exclusive features to its own new phones. Google Pixel exclusive features explored: A cut above the rest of Android? Android 7.1 Nougat: Release date Google started rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to Nexus devices on 22 August. This covered a great number of devices, but it wasn't until early October that the Nexus 6 got in on the action, with that update appearing on 3 October. The LG V20, officially unveiled on 6 September, was the first device to feature Android 7.0 Nougat right out of the box. Android 7.1 Nougat launched with the Pixel phones on 4 October, with those two devices becoming available on 20 October. Google has subsequently confirmed the Android 7.1 beta programme, which started on 19 October. The final release of Android 7.1.x is scheduled for early December. Google has also confirmed it is working with device manufacturers to bring the Nougat update to your devices. Android 7.1 Nougat update: Nexus devices Google started rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat from 22 August. The company confirmed the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player and Pixel C would all be getting an over-the-air updates, which has happened for Android 7.0 Nougat. The Nexus 5 has been put out to pasture. Google has started the Android 7.1 beta programme, bringing Daydream VR support and other goodies to devices prior to full release and that started on 19 October. The Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Pixel C can all get access to Android 7.1 now. Android Nougat: How to get Android 7.1 on your phone right now The beta programme will extend to other devices in November, when you can expect to give it a try on your Nexus 6 and Nexus 9. Google has also confirmed that the Android 7.1.x final release is due in early December, when all the eligible Nexus devices will update - including the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Pixel C, Pixel and Pixel XL - and some Android One devices. Android 7.1 Nougat update: BlackBerry BlackBerry is all about Android now. The BlackBerry Priv launched on Android Lollipop and it took six months to see an update to Marshmallow. With a bit of luck BlackBerry will speed things up for Android Nougat but early 2017 is probably more likely than the end of 2016. Android 7.1 Nougat update: HTC HTC operates a 90-day promise for software updates and the company also says your device will be updated for two years following its release. It has confirmed via Twitter that it has received the "final shipping Android 7.0 Nougat software" and that it expects to roll out to begin in Q4. HTC has said Android Nougat will be coming to unlocked models of the HTC 10, HTC One A9 and the HTC One M9, as well as carrier versions. There was no mention of the One M8 but expect Android Nougat on HTC around the end of November 2016. If Google releases the additional code for 7.1, HTC may well move to bring all of it to those HTC handsets, or might just be offering 7.0. Android 7.1 Nougat update: Huawei Huawei began offering Android Marshmallow devices from November 2015 when it launched its Mate 8 with the software pre-loaded. This might therefore mean the company will do the same this year, launching the Mate 9 with Android Nougat before the end of the year. In terms of updates, it might be a couple more months before older devices see the Nougat update but Huawei is a little quicker than others. We can't be sure if Huawei will offer 7.1 Nougat, but the company already offers one of the 7.1 additions - a swipe action on the fingerprint scanner. Android 7.1 Nougat update: Honor Sub-brand of Huawei, Honor, launched the Honor 7 Enhanced Edition in December 2015, offering Android Marshmallow from the box. The Honor 5X and the standard model of the Honor 7 then both received the Marshmallow update a couple of months later around March so early 2017 for Android Nougat is a safer bet than end of 2016. Like Huawei, Honor already offers a swipe action on the fingerprint scanner, one of the features of Android 7.1. The company has however announced the public BETA test of EMUI 5, based on Android Nougat for the Honor 8, as of 9 November. Android 7.1 Nougat update: LG The Android 7.0 Nougat update has begun rolling out to LG G5 owners in South Korea. Other regions will get the update in the coming weeks. Users with older handsets like the LG G4 may have to wait a few more months but early 2017 is plausible based on this year's update schedule. The company also launched the LG V20 on 6 September, which is the company's first device running Android 7.0 Nougat and the first device to launch with the new software out of the box. Android 7.1 Nougat update: Motorola In the past, Motorola was amongst the fastest to update devices, but that hasn't been the case for Nougat. The company has gone official, however, confirming a wide number of handsets that will be updated Moto G (4th Gen) Moto G Plus (4th Gen) Moto G Play (4th Gen) Moto X Pure Edition (3rd Gen) Moto X Style Moto X Play Moto X Force Droid Turbo 2 Droid Maxx 2 Moto Z Moto Z Droid Moto Z Force Droid Moto Z Play Moto Z Play Droid Nexus 6 The new Moto Z and Moto G4 will be the first on the list, with updates from Q4 2016. It's not clear if this will be Android 7.0 or 7.1, but the testing on the Moto G4 has already started testing with a small number of users in Brazil. Android 7.1 Nougat update: OnePlus OnePlus hasn't been the fastest at updating its devices to Marshmallow. The OnePlus 2 didn't receive the update until the beginning of June and the OnePlus X is only just about to receive it, meaning it has waited until October. The company is teasing, however, tweeting on 4 October to tell owners that it is working on the Nougat update for the OnePlus 3.  Android 7.1 Nougat update: Samsung Samsung phased a roll-out for the Marshmallow update, with some devices receiving it in South Korea at the end of January 2016. Other regions and devices had to wait a little longer with updates still being pushed in March 2016. With so many devices to update, Samsung tends to be a little slower. At the moment, the company hasn't committed to a timeline, but it's thought that the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will be updated to the Grace UX - as found on the Note 7. That update might incorporate the 7.1 Nougat update too. Apparently the company will be kicking off pre-release Android 7.0 software updates on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge from 11 November, with a plan to conclude the Galaxy Beta Programme around mid-December.  The T-Mobile network has confirmed some Samsung devices that will be updated at some point, including: Note 5, S6, S6 edge, S7 and S7 edge. Android 7.0 Nougat update: Sony Xperia Sony has announced it will make Android Nougat available to the Xperia Z3+, Xperia Z4 Tablet, Xperia Z5, Xperia Z5 Compact, Xperia Z5 Premium, Xperia X, Xperia XA, Xperia XA Ultra and Xperia X Performance. The company said the update would come to devices "as quickly as we can" and a press conference held by Sony Slovakia detailed roughly when. Apparently, the Sony Xperia XZ and Z Performance will be first and users can expect the update in October 2016, followed by the Xperia X and X Compact in November 2016. The Xperia Z5 series, Z3+ and Z4 Tablet are expected to receive the update in December 2016, while the Xperia XA and XA Ultra are last on the list with a date of "early 2017".  Sections Google Android Phone Best smartphones 2016: The best phones available to buy today Best smartphones to look forward to in 2017 Best budget smartphones 2016: The best phones available to buy for under £200 Apple iOS 10 tips and tricks: See what your iPhone and iPad can do now Popular In Phone On Pocket-lint What is the Mannequin Challenge?

All three devices have the company's new Google Assistant built-in. What is Google Assistant, how does it work, when can you use it? Assistant is an evolution of Google Now and is designed to offer each individual user a personal experience, being able to have proper conversations and understanding relatively complex tasks. You can get Assistant with the Allo app for Android and iOS devices, but it's built into the core of Pixel phones and Home speaker. Variety reports that Google has said it's now holding talks with home audio manufacturers to embed Assistant into their products as well, specifically the ones that already support Google Cast. Variety also says that Google has in some way demanded that any manufacturer that uses Google Cast, can't use competing technologies such as Amazon's Alexa, however some Bluetooth speakers and AV receivers do use Apple AirPlay as well, but this doesn't a voice assistant in the same way. Mario Queroz, VP of product management at Google has also apparently said Google is looking into ways of allowing manufacturers that don't currently use Cast to built the Assistant technology into their products as well.

A federal judge in San Jose, California, on Wednesday gave conditional approval for the suit to proceed with group status on behalf of people age 40 and older who unsuccessfully sought engineering positions with the internet giant since August 2010. Cheryl Fillekes claims she was interviewed by Google four times from 2007 to 2014 and was never offered employment despite her “highly pertinent qualifications and programming experience” because of her age. She accused the company of “a systematic pattern and practice of discriminating” against older people. U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that while her ruling doesn’t address the merits of the case, Fillekes supported her ageism allegations with statements by other rejected job applicants to show that they were all allegedly “the victims of a single decision, policy or plan.” The company will have another chance to argue that the case isn’t suited for group status after more evidence is collected, the judge said. Freeman denied group status to a man denied a job at Google who also alleged age bias. William Fitzgerald, a Google spokesman, declined to comment on the decision. HP, PwC Suits Wednesday’s ruling comes as other companies fight age-bias cases in which employees seek class-action status. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. were accused in August of cutting “tens of thousands” of employees 40 years and older and replacing them with younger workers. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was sued in February over claims that it prides itself on hiring “millennials,” while turning away older job seekers. PwC has denied the claims. Tesla Motors Inc. was sued last month by an engineer who claims his age, 69, was “a substantial motivating factor” in his February firing, although he didn’t file the case as a class action. Google objected to group status, saying in a court filing that it’s received more than 1 million applications for engineering jobs in the past six years and has no way of knowing who was 40 or older because it doesn’t collect data on birth dates. The company argued that sorting through all the facts about why specific individuals weren’t hired makes the case unmanageable. The company also said that the ageism theory floated by Fillekes is “speculation, not proof” because it interviewed her multiple times after it could have learned she was over 40. Google said that while Fillekes and the other job seekers she has cited as examples in her case were found by staff interviewers to be “Googley” enough to to be a good fit for the company’s culture, they didn’t demonstrate the technical aptitude required for the job. Daniel Kotchen, an attorney for Fillekes, said the next step will be to reach out to Google job applicants to find people qualified to join the case. The case is Heath v. Google Inc., 15-cv-01824, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). Copyright 2016 Bloomberg.

The big move down came after technology news site Recode said Google would not pursue a Twitter acquisition. Google had been seen by some observers as one of the more likely purchasers. In mid-morning trade, Twitter was at $20.20, down from Wednesday's close of $24.87. Twitter, which celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, has yet to make a profit ©Andrew Burton (Getty/AFP/File) Neither Twitter nor Google responded quickly to a request for comment. Recode also reported that Apple was unlikely to offer a bid and that Disney had no plans to bid. Talks remain active between Salesforce.com and Twitter, although some Salesforce shareholders are opposed, said a person familiar with the issue. After falling to its lowest point ever earlier this year, Twitter shares were boosted recently on hopes the company will gain traction or a make a promising match with a suitor. Twitter, which celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, has yet to make a profit. Co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as chief executive last year but has yet to ignite growth, with the number of users stagnating at slightly more than 300 million for several quarters. Twitter was expected to begin accepting bids this week. The social messaging platform would be a big-ticket item, with its value based on the share price topping $17 billion on Wednesday, and the company likely to want a premium to be paid. No suitors have declared interest in Twitter publicly, however. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Stop Video Replay 1:06 Twitter shares fall on reports Google won't bid UP NEXT VIDEO Twitter shares fall on reports Google won't bid Shares in Twitter sank 20 percent to close at $19.87, giving back most of the gains from speculation in recent weeks of a buyout by a major tech or media group. On Wednesday, technology news site Recode said Google parent Alphabet would not pursue a Twitter acquisition. Google had been seen by some observers as one of the more likely purchasers. Neither Twitter nor Google responded to a request for comment. Recode also reported that other potential suitors were also cooling -- that Apple was unlikely to pursue a bid and that Disney had no plans to make an offer. Talks remain active between cloud computing group Salesforce.com and Twitter, according to some reports. After falling to its lowest point ever earlier this year, Twitter shares were boosted recently on hopes the company will gain traction or a make a promising match with a suitor. Twitter, which celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, has yet to make a profit. Co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as chief executive last year but has yet to ignite growth, with the number of users stagnating at slightly more than 300 million for several quarters. Twitter was expected to begin accepting bids this week, reports said. The social messaging platform would be a big-ticket item, with its value based on the share price topping $17 billion on Wednesday, and the company likely to want a premium to be paid.

Google is clearly taking a jab at Apple with a powerful handset duo, but like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the new Pixel phones carry a hefty price tag: the Pixel XL with 128GB of storage costs a staggering $869, with the base 32GB option starting at $769.   Pixel (32GB) in Very Silver, Quite Black or Really Blue: $649 or $27.04/month for 24 months with Google Store Financing   Pixel (128GB) in Very Silver or Quite Black: $749 or $31.21/month for 24 months with Google Store Financing   Pixel XL (32GB) in Very Silver, Quite Black or Really Blue: $769 or $32.04/month for 24 months with Google Store Financing   Pixel XL (128GB) in Very Silver or Quite Black: $869 or $36.21/month for 24 months with Google Store Financing   Now if you're used to upgrading to flagships every year or two, you won't really be deterred by this cost, and Apple's probably conditioned your wallet. This is new territory for Google, however. As a quick price comparison, Google's previous premium handset, the Nexus 6P, cost $649 for the 128GB variant.   But for everyone else who isn't used to paying almost $900 for a smartphone, Google is offering financing options, and you can get a Pixel XL with 128GB for less than $40 a month for 24 months. Google is also throwing in a free Daydream VR headset for Pixel XL purchases.   Sadly, it looks like you won't even get the snazzy Really Blue color scheme with your $869 Pixel XL phone: the color isn't currently available on the 128GB models, and you can only choose between Very Silver or Quite Black.   Both the Pixel and Pixel XL are unlocked, but Verizon has been tapped as the handset's carrier partner. Google's low-cost Google Fi service is also supported by the new Pixel phones. Pre-orders appear to be sold out right now, and you'll have to join a wait list if you want to buy.     Pixel Specs:   OS: Android 7.1 Display: 5-inch 1920 x 1080 CPU: Quad-core 2.15GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor RAM: 4GB LPDDR4 Storage: 32GB or 128GB Battery: 2770 mAh   Pixel XL Specs:   OS: Android 7.1 Display: 5.5-inch 2560 x 1440 CPU: Quad-core 2.15GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor RAM: 4GB LPDDR4 Storage: 32GB or 128GB Battery: 3450 mAh Recommended for You iPhone 7 could come out in a new - Jet White color Samsung Galaxy S8 will ship with an AI digital assistant...

Both Pixel models are powered by the latest Snapdragon 821 processor and run a specialised version of Google’s Android software, which includes support for the Daydream virtual reality platform that was announced at Google I/O in the summer. As a premium market handset the phone offers consumers great new features such as Google Assistant, endless cloud storage & VR compatibility Google Assistant. Pixel is the first phone with the new Google Assistant built in. When you touch and hold the home button or say the “hot word,” the Assistant “jumps into action.” In Google’s event demo, the Assistant is used to bring up photos from a particular time or place from the past, and also plays whatever music you ask it to play, choosing your favourite music app by default. >See also: Why are Google killing the password? Similarly, it integrates the Google Now on tap functionality, allowing the users to swipe up with information on the screen, such as a restaurant name, and provides further information, such as reviews and the restaurant’s address. Also, like a bot, the Google Assistant will take your reservation for that same restaurant using only voice prompts. Endless cloud storage Google will allow free unlimited storage for full-resolution images and videos shot with the Pixel. That’s much like the standard Google Photos backup ability, but takes off the size limit and compression, even on a 4K video shot with the new phone. Benchmark camera experience Both rear camera models score an 89 in DxOMark, the highest rating ever for a smart phone. With 12.3-megapixel resolution with large 1.55-micron pixels Google isn’t shy in presenting this as the best smartphone ever. Virtual Reality One of the biggest selling points for The Pixel is the first Daydream-ready phone and Google announced the Daydream View headset to accommodate the Pixel for VR use. The Daydream View comes bundled with a tiny motion controller. So far, Google has announced a handful of VR games and 360-degree experiences. From the hardware and software front, the Pixel phones are both made out of aluminium with a big glass window at the back, surrounding the camera, flash, and the fingerprint sensor. >See also: Google is applying machine learning to more than 100 projects Android also looks quite unique on Pixel as Google has continued with their new round style stock google app icons, replacing the search bar found at the top of the home screen with the Google “G” button and adding a frosted-glass-looking tray for the apps pinned to the bottom of the phone’s home screen. Another Pixel-specific software change is every photo and video you shoot on a Pixel phone automatically will be uploaded to the cloud via the Google Photos app, in full resolution. The hype around Pixel is finally here and with features that will make old and new Android fans rejoice.   Sourced by Jake Davis, design director, Pocket App Related Topics Google Pixel smartphone Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Read More Latest Popular How mobility leaders are driving modern businesses How Industry 4.0 is changing human-technology interaction The secret cyber-life of 10 year olds UK public sector increase in cloud use Future tech trends: these technologies will transform businesses The path to manageable data Wine cellar, swimming pool and a treehouse: Inside Zoopla’s new office The smart nation: Singapore’s masterplan Turning big data into high-class insights Rolling into the digital age: inside Rolls-Royce’s tech transformation Products Information Age Magazine Since its launch in 1995, Information Age has been regarded as one of the most respected technology titles in the B2B realm.

The work is a surprise new project by Alphabet’s health spin-off, Verily, which says it hopes to release millions or billions of sterilized mosquitoes as a way to battle the spread of dengue and the Zika virus, including in U.S. cities. The plan, endorsed at the highest levels of Alphabet, formerly known as Google and the world’s second most valuable company after Apple, involves new gadgetry for rearing mosquitoes, geospatial software to track them, and plans for pilot tests in which mosquitoes would be released from trucks in urban areas. Big, hard-to-solve public health problems seem increasingly irresistible to Silicon Valley. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg announced he’d give away $3 billion to solve “all disease” within a century. And Verily’s jump into mosquitoes also lands it in territory already staked out by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, whose foundation has spent $40 million on Eliminate Dengue, a mosquito program preparing large-scale interventions in Rio de Janeiro and Medellin, Colombia. Verily’s project, still at an early stage, is the brainchild of Linus Upson, a senior Google engineer who previously headed Chrome, the company’s category-killing Internet browser. Mosquitoes kill more people than any other animal and, Upson says, “the question is what could Google do to solve it." Zika and dengue are spread by Aedes aegypti, an urban mosquito that’s widespread in Latin America and has found its way north. This year the bug began spreading Zika in Miami, causing the first locally acquired cases of that disease in the U.S.   Verily says it is announcing its project because it is hoping to conduct field tests of its mosquitoes, plans that would become public anyway. “People in some parts of the U.S. are asking for help,” says Upson. “But if we are going to release mosquitoes in the real world, we need to talk to communities. This isn’t like launching a consumer Internet service.” Upson declined to say which areas, cities, or countries might be first, saying discussions with partner organizations were ongoing. Verily is part of Alphabet’s “other bets,” including Google Fiber, anti-aging company Calico, and Nest. In the first six months of 2016, these ventures lost $1.6 billion, and some investors will scratch their heads at the idea of the Silicon Valley giant creating mosquito farms. Alphabet’s life science subsidiary has launched an array of new ventures, including miniature glucose sensors and a $700 million joint venture with Glaxo to develop “bioelectronic” drugs, although the company’s ideas have also drawn criticism for being seemingly disconnected and far-fetched. Upson, a vice president for engineering at Verily, spent a year investigating every aspect of mosquito science, e-mailing experts, even sitting in on meetings being held in Hawaii, where mosquitoes are ravaging native birds. “I’ve known they were interested, but the work has been done under a lot of secrecy,” says Scott O’Neill, the Australian entomologist who leads Eliminate Dengue. Verily considered a variety of ideas for controlling mosquitoes. One technology Upson looked at is gene drives, a “selfish” DNA construct that mosquitoes pass to their offspring, but that later poisons them. But that idea is controversial and still in the early stages, says Upson. Verily also passed up a chance to buy Oxitec, a U.K. company that has been testing gene-modified mosquitoes, and was later acquired by Intrexon, a U.S. synthetic biology conglomerate, for $160 million. Alphabet’s health spin-off instead settled on a less radical way of modifying mosquitoes that involves infecting them with a bacteria called Wolbachia. When a male carrying Wolbachia mates with a normal female, her eggs are incorrectly fertilized and offspring don’t develop. Think of it as a form of birth control. Releasing millions of males in a neighborhood or city could cause mosquito populations to disappear. The Wolbachia technique is fairly well studied, deemed safe, and is also lightly regulated in the U.S. as a “biopesticide.” One company, Mosquito Mate, based in Kentucky, has already been testing the technique in Los Angeles and near Fresno, and its trials haven’t generated any public outcry. “This is a great field to be in if your motto is ‘don't be evil,’” says Guy Reeves, an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute, referring to the original motto of Google. “It’s possible to undertake experimental releases without endangering the community consent that is always the basis for effective mosquito control.” The “sterile male technique” can be effective. A decades-long campaign of insect releases has driven back a cattle pest, the screwworm, all the way from Texas to the isthmus of Panama. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also still spreads sterile fruit flies in California. Those bugs are sterilized with radiation. Mosquito control is generally handled by public health authorities, so how Verily could make money at it is not clear. Upson says Google often launches products, like the free Chrome browser, even if there’s no money in it right away. “We don’t need all the answers to get started,” Upson says. “We can see where it lands.” Verily does think it can make mosquitoes fast and cheaply. Its engineers are developing automated ways to rear them and to separate the males from females, a task currently handled manually by shaking pupae through a filter. “It’s labor-intensive, and we want to bring some engineering to it,” says Upson. “We can make it cheaper to do at scale.”     From Our Advertisers In partnership with Dynatrace Emerging Trend Analysis: What is Digital Performance Management?

Google And Apple Reportedly Not Making Offers By Susmita Baral @sushbaral On 10/06/16 AT 11:01 AM Close Twitter’s shares dropped in premarket trading on Thursday after a report said Google would not be making an offer for the microblogging platform. According to USA Today, shares fell 16 percent after the stock inflated upon speculation over third party interest in the social media company. Citing anonymous sources close to the situation, Recode refuted previous speculation that Google and Apple would be making a bid for Twitter. Salesforce was also rumored to be in the run for acquiring the company—the Wall Street Journal, also citing anonymous sources, previously reported that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff sees Twitter as an “unpolished jewel” and the data from Twitter can be an asset to the Salesforce’s sales and marketing software business. But in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday—after Salesforce’s stock fell 6 percent in light of the Journal’s report—Benioff gave a not-so-promising statement. “We look at everything,” said Benioff. “You name it, we look at it. It's in our interest to look at everything. We have to go deep on everything to understand what is possible for our shareholders and what isn't. But in the scheme of things, if you look back at my track record as a CEO I think you'll find I look at a lot of things, [but] I actually pass on most things.” He added later in the interview: “We have to look at everything. We're going to pass on most things. And the reality is our decisions have been very, very good for our company. On the vast majority of the deals we do, the stock goes up.” Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report stated that Walt Disney Co. has hired an advisor to make a bid on Twitter—Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is on the board of Disney. This would “give [Disney] an opportunity to communicate directly with their customers in an increasingly fragmented media landscape,” says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Paul Sweeney. While the list of potential buyers is up in the air, Twitter shopping itself on the market is not. Recode confirms that Twitter is still up for sale and Reuters reports that the company wants to complete talks with buyers by Oct. 27, when it reports its third-quarter earnings. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that there is an internal battle within Twitter regarding the future of the struggling company: Dorsey wants Twitter to remain an independent company while co-founder Ev Williams wants to sell. And then there is Anthony Noto, Twitter’s chief financial officer hired in 2014, who is reportedly the one calling the shots behind the scenes. At Twitter’s quarterly-results conference call earlier this year, Dorsey vocalized his thoughts about selling the company. When an analyst asked why the company should run as an independent company rather than being owned by a larger organization, he cited the future of the company—its room for growth—as the main reason. “As CEO I've just seen a lot of the benefit of our focus and our disciplined execution over the past year, and the changes we're making to the product focused on the use cases that we believe are important, that real-time news and social commentary are actually increasing retention and engagement,” said Dorsey, reports Business Insider. “And I think there's just so much farther to go in terms of our strength as not only a service of importance, but also a company and a business of importance. We're focused right now on what matters most and what we need to fix, and we're seeing really healthy signs that are pointing us in the right direction in terms of what we need to continue to do. I have a lot of confidence in the ability and also that our five priorities are the right ones to drive sustained growth. Over time." Venture capitalist Chris Sacca, an early investor of Twitter and a vocal advocate of putting Dorsey back in charge last year, has given his two cents: the company should be sold. Related Stories Bids For Twitter Expected This Week, Report Says Here's How You Can Create "Moments" On Twitter "It's just an incredible story of underachievement — of potential that was never realized," he told Bloomberg TV's Emily Chang on Tuesday. "I'd be really excited for someone with some product vision to go in there and take some chances." Dorsey took back the reins as CEO last year after being ousted from the role in 2008. Under Dorsey’s leadership, the platform rolled out many changes: it modified how it counts the 140-character limit, introduced the “Moments” feature that allows users to create stories, and brought live TV to the platform. But user growth and revenue has failed to grow as well. Since his return—Dorsey is still the CEO of Square Inc.—the former micro-manager’s “leadership style in the past year at Twitter has been Socratic, not prescriptive,” says Bloomberg. Dorsey has given a lot of command to Noto, who is credited for snagging the NFL deal to live stream 10 Thursday Night Football games this season and is reportedly responsible for the company’s entry into live video. “Noto has been just as responsible, just as influential at the company as Jack,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, to Bloomberg. “He’s been unusually active as a CFO.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Home Markets World markets Twitter shares plunge 19 per cent on report that Google, Disney won’t make bid Twitter shares plunge 19 per cent on report that Google, Disney won’t make bid Twitter shares plunged on Thursday, a day after technology website Recode reported that Alphabet's Google and Disney would not bid for the social network and Apple was unlikely to be a suitor. By: Reuters | New York | Updated: October 6, 2016 8:34 PM Twitter’s shares fell as much as 19.2 percent to .10, valuing the company at about .2 billion. They were last down 17.2 percent at .60. (Reuters) Twitter shares plunged on Thursday, a day after technology website Recode reported that Alphabet’s Google and Disney would not bid for the social network and Apple was unlikely to be a suitor. The company has requested binding acquisition bids within the next two weeks, Reuters reported on Wednesday, and hopes to wrap up sale negotiations before the end of the month. Google was a likely contender for the microblogging service, Recode reported, but those familiar with the deal said the company was not moving forward with an effort to buy Twitter at this time. Twitter’s shares fell as much as 19.2 percent to $20.10, valuing the company at about $14.2 billion. They were last down 17.2 percent at $20.60. Salesforce.com Inc is now left as the only potential buyer, Recode said, although the cloud-software maker has not confirmed publicly that it wants to make a bid. Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff told CNBC on Wednesday that Twitter was “an exciting product, but obviously the business has a lot of challenges.” The rationale for Salesforce bidding on Twitter is not clear, said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a note to clients. Buying Twitter would reduce the value of Salesforce shares by about $11 through dilution, while increased debt could cut another $9.50 from the stock. Salesforce’s shares were up 3.6 percent at $70.90 on Thursday. Other potential bidders beyond Salesforce are taking a look at Twitter, CNBC said, citing sources. And Google might not be out of the running entirely, said Patrick Moorhead, analyst from Moor Insights & Strategy. “I think Google needs Twitter and Twitter needs Google. Google has failed multiple times to create a compelling social media platform and they need a company like Twitter,” Moorhead said. “I do not think this is the end of it. This is more likely Google trying to send a message to Twitter that ‘your terms are too rich.'” Twitter has told potential acquirers it wants to conclude negotiations about selling itself by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27. The timeline is ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. The company, run by Jack Dorsey, has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit despite having about 313 million average monthly active users. Twitter missed Wall Street sales expectations in the first and second quarters of 2016 and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company. Up to Wednesday’s close, Twitter’s stock had fallen nearly 12 percent in the last 12 months, but had risen by about a third since reports emerged in September that the company was in talks with Salesforce.

Apple cloud services teams run by executive Eddy Cue, including Siri, Maps, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple News and parts of iTunes and Apple Music, will move together into the company’s existing Infinite Loop campus in Cupertino, California, the people said. Currently, most Apple services are developed separately from each other in office parks rented out in other parts of Cupertino and Sunnyvale, California. Another person with knowledge of the matter said that Cue’s team will be located in at least three different locations across Silicon Valley. The current structure contributes to software bugs and slow product development, the people said. Bringing the teams together at a single, dedicated campus is designed to improve growth of the services business and fight competition from Google and Amazon, the people added. They did not want to be identified talking about private Apple plans. Apple declined to comment. Another person said that it’s always been part of Apple’s culture to house teams together, where possible. As iPhone growth slows and Apple goes behind the scenes to develop new hardware, the services business has been a bright spot. It grew almost 20 percent in the third quarter and may soon pass the Mac and iPad as Apple’s second-largest revenue source. Still, Apple’s cloud services have been criticized by users because of technical issues and a lack of new features. The company also stumbled in 2008 with MobileMe and in 2012 with Maps. Cloud Space Space for the cloud teams at the current headquarters will begin to open as Apple inches toward the launch of Apple Campus 2, a futuristic, circular structure with multiple floors of open work space. Apple will begin moving employees there in 2017, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in March. Apple broke ground on the new campus in 2013, following a well-documented announcement by company co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. While many Apple executives want to relocate their teams to the new campus, Cue thinks unifying at the old campus is a suitable way to improve his organization, one of the people said. A committee of Apple managers is working on the plan to reorganize Apple across its current and future locations. Apple originally expected up to 13,000 employees at the new campus. Apple anticipates that the number may grow and recently discussed plans to adjust internal office space if necessary, according to a person familiar with the situation.

While some of Apple’s senior vice presidents are expected to see their offices move over to the new campus -- less than a five minute drive from the current headquarters -- management must be at a vice president level or above to get a formal office, one of the people said. Previous plans included office space for senior directors, who report to vice presidents. Another person said that some employees below vice president will be eligible for offices. The new campus will include bench seating, long work tables, and open cubicle spaces, potentially irking employees used to quiet office environments, two people briefed on the new campus’s plans said. Apple’s presentations to the city of Cupertino have indicated that the open floor plan designs are conducive to collaboration between teams. Apple’s Pie Apple is also reorganizing its cloud computing resources to bolster its services business. The company is moving its infrastructure -- things like software to process Siri queries and Apple Music downloads -- onto a single, Apple-made system, according to people familiar with the matter. Code-named Pie, the platform gives Apple more control and may speed up load times. Apple has begun moving over parts of Siri, the iTunes Store, and Apple News to the new platform, one of the people said. Apple plans to move other services, including Maps, to its new system over the next few years. Apple has also developed an internal photo storage system dubbed McQueen to gradually end its reliance on Google and Amazon servers, the people said. The company recently indicated it is taking the cloud more seriously by hiring former Time Warner Cable executive Peter Stern as a vice president leading cloud services.

USA TODAY Twitter headquarters in San Francisco (Photo: Eric Risberg, Associated Press) SAN FRANCISCO —Twitter shares plunged 20.1% Thursday after published reports said would-be suitors including Google would not bid for the struggling social media company. Technology news outlet Recode said Google and Disney would not pursue Twitter and Apple was unlikely to buy it either, deflating the stock that had soared on takeover speculation. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com, considered one of the more likely suitors for Twitter, also seemed to downplay his interest during an analyst meeting at his company's annual Dreamforce event in San Francisco. "We look at everything and we don’t buy most things, and we haven’t agreed to buy that company," he said Wednesday, emphasizing that Salesforce.com has a "disciplined M&A process." FindTheCompany | Graphiq TWTR shares fell $5 even to $19.87 in Thursday trading. "We see diminishing prospects for a takeout," said Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. analyst James M Cakmak. According to Reuters, Twitter has said it wants to finish up talks with potential buyers by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey returned to the helm last year to revive the company's sagging fortunes. User growth and revenue have flattened, prompting Twitter to engage in talks with potential buyers. CFRA analyst Scott Kessler who is maintaining a "hold" rating on the stock, says he's unsure Twitter can command a substantial premium given its growth challenges that any buyer would inherit. Of the 41 sell-side analysts tracking the stock, five rate it a buy, one outperform, 25 hold, three underperform and seven sell, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. USA TODAY Jack Dorsey hasn't fixed the trouble with Twitter Driving interest in Twitter: data and reams of it. "We think it’s best to evaluate Twitter not as a social network with about 300 million users, but rather as a data asset,"  Cakmak wrote in a research note. "You are buying the last available source of data in building out a user interest graph that’s actually able to be acquired." 49 CONNECTTWEET 16 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2e3Gh21

Comments By Patrick Thibodeau Follow Computerworld | Oct 6, 2016 12:21 AM PT RELATED TOPICS IT Careers IT Industry Search Comments An age discrimination lawsuit against Google was approved Wednesday as a '"collective action" by a federal court judge in San Jose. The decision means that certain types of software engineers, age 40 or over, who were rejected for jobs at Google since August 2014, and after an in-person interview, will be able to join the lawsuit. Thousands of others may be eligible. But this was more than an ordinary court ruling. Judge Beth Labson Freeman's ruling may be remembered for the artful flourish of its opening sentence and the challenge it seems to be delivering to Silicon Valley. "How does age factor into one's Googleyness?" Freeman wrote at the beginning of a 17-page decision that sets in motion an investigation of Google's hiring practices and corporate culture. The decision concludes by approving a "collective action" -- a type of class action -- that allows a certain class of Google job applicants to join the lawsuit. An effort will made to contact affected people. This lawsuit was brought by two job applicants, both over the age of 40, who alleged age discrimination against Google. One of the plaintiffs, Cheryl Fillekes, a programmer, was interviewed by Google on four separate occasions, including in-person interviews, and was rejected each time. A second plaintiff, Robert Heath, was interviewed by phone, but not in person. The judge limited the class to people who had an in-person interview, which means that job applicants who only had phone interviews can't join the class. The plaintiffs believe tens of thousands may be eligible to join this lawsuit. Google responded to the court's decision in an email: "We believe the allegations here are without merit and we will continue to defend our position vigorously. We have strong policies against discrimination on any unlawful basis, including age," a spokesman wrote. "Anyone who fits the class definition can opt in to the class," said Daniel Low, a Washington-based attorney for the plaintiffs. "For those interviewed in person with Google for a software engineer, site reliability engineer, or systems engineer position when they were 40 years old or older, and received notice on or after August 28, 2014, that they were refused employment, they will have an opportunity to join in the collective action against Google." The plaintiffs are negotiating with Google to get the email addresses of people who fit the class. Google doesn't have the birth dates of job applicants, so it's likely that the college graduation year and employment dates at other companies will be used as a tipoff for age. "We encourage anyone who receives notice to join the class to help vindicate the rights of those subject to age discrimination," Low said. Low said the case may have importance for Silicon Valley as well as Google. "This is an important step forward for the case, and allows us to seek much broader relief than an individual action would have, and it positions the case to have a greater deterrent effect on age discrimination at Google and in the tech industry if it is successful," Low said. In her ruling, Freeman gave weight to Fillekes arguments that she was a victim of age discrimination. Fillekes makes "substantial allegations," wrote the judge, "that the putative class members were together the victims of a single decision, policy, or plan." The lawsuit claimed the median age at Google was 29, based on data collected by Payscale, which the judge cited in the ruling. "Fillekes also recounts her own experience. Among other things, Fillekes describes an instruction from a Google recruiter to "put her dates of graduation on her resume 'so the interviewers [could] see how old [she is] and various concerns about her years of experience," the judge wrote. The judge said that Google's Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) statement was not enough to protect it. "Having such a policy does not necessarily shield a company from a discrimination suit, particularly in light of the evidence and allegations presented here," wrote Freeman, who said that most, if not all companies, "are well versed in anti-discrimination law and make great efforts to ensure that their written policies comply with anti-discrimination law." The decision does not mean that Google will lose the case. The judge said that evidence from an employer "is not germane at the first stage of the certification process, which is focused simply on whether notice should be disseminated to potential claimants." Google, in an earlier court filing, defended itself. It said that Fillekes was recruited by Google four times, in 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2013, and had in-person interviews. Why "waste Google employees' time" with "five or six onsite interviews only to reject the candidate on the basis of age," the company asked, in its filing. "Googleyness" is a term that job applicants at Google may be familiar with. The firm explains it, on its website, this way: "Googleyness: Share how you work individually and on a team, how you help others, how you navigate ambiguity, and how you push yourself to grow outside of your comfort zone."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's Latest Methodology for Producing a Mirror-Like Finish on the iPhone Revealed | Main | Court Agrees with Apple to Delay the Parthenon Unified Memory Architecture Infringement Case until 2017 » October 06, 2016 Expected Volume for Google's Pixel Phone in Q4 to Top Off at 4 Million Units   On Tuesday we posted a report titled "Google Introduces Pixel the Smartphone and other Hardware Devices Squarely Aimed at Amazon and Samsung." In that report we noted that "as far as the Pixel smartphone goes, will it really sell more than their Nexus line did? Until Google could hit volume, Foxconn won't even look at them. So HTC is who Google is stuck with as a supplier. I think that speaks volumes for now." Today DigiTimes basically confirmed that assumption. DigiTimes, which is considered the number one source for supply chain news in the tech sector, indicated that their research points to low Pixel phone volume for 2016. How low? The estimate tops off at 4 million units which is less than what Apple is expected to sell in a week.   DigiTimes notes in a report today that "The recently launched Google Pixel smartphone is expected to reach 3-4 million shipments in the second half of 2016. While this total pales in comparison to the number of iPhone 7 shipments expected through the end of the year, it will still provide a major boost to Taiwan smartphone maker High Tech Computer (HTC), the manufacturer of the phone. The Pixel shipments will account for 40-50% of HTC's smartphone shipments in the second half of the year."   Even if Google could sell more, it's unlikely that HTC would be able to handle greater volumes. But that's likely not going to be the case anyways. It's likely to be under 4 million for 2016.   The DigiTimes researcher Luke Lin noted that "while many market watchers have compared the Pixel smartphones with the iPhone 7 in terms of specifications, expected shipments are quite another story. Apple's new smartphone shipments are expected to achieve far more volume, as in 20-30 fold more than Google's Pixel in the second half of the year."   While Google pumped up the Pixel phone at launch against Apple's iPhone 7 for reasons of pure hyperbole, the reality is it will likely to hurt Samsung Galaxy or LG smartphone sales.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Kansas City, MO (PRWEB) October 06, 2016 Infegy, a leading social media intelligence technology provider, partnered with leading global brand consultancy Interbrand to analyze social media data provided by Twitter for its 2016 Best Global Brands Report, naming Apple, Google, and Coca-Cola the three most valuable brands. Now in its 17th edition, the Interbrand report reveals the Anatomy of Growth, and features an insider’s view of how great brands grow great businesses. “Accurate analysis of social media data represents an important opportunity for brands to connect with consumer opinion in a way that makes sure they’re really hearing what people have to offer in the conversation,” said Justin Graves, Infegy Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “By working directly with social media data from Twitter, we were able to provide insights into what these consumers think and how they feel, which is a crucial dimension of growth for any business.” Infegy’s Thematic and Emotional Analysis Infegy Atlas leverages advanced linguistic analysis algorithms to deliver comprehensive brand and consumer insights using social data, with instant results. Brands and market researchers can use the platform to understand consumers opinion on any given topic using publicly-available posts from across the internet. Brands can evaluate the elements of a conversation situated around Purchase Intent or Confidence to understand what portion of their query data represents consumers communicating those ideas, in addition to a comprehensive sentiment analysis of each of its conversational themes. Interbrand’s methodology recognizes that any comprehensive forecast of consumer opinion or market trends need a more developed understanding of the drivers behind purchasing behaviors. “Strong brands influence customer choice and create loyalty; attract, retain, and motivate talent; and lower the cost of financing. Our brand valuation methodology has been specifically designed to take all of these factors into account.” Speaking about the report results, Interbrand Global CEO Jez Frampton commented that “[i]t’s clear the best global brands are not just weathering change, but driving it. They understand their Anatomy of Growth is complex, unique and personal; they look inward and outward, expand into new markets, and create better experiences to grow their brands and businesses.” The 2016 Interbrand Report For the fourth consecutive year, Apple and Google topped the list of Best Global Brands. Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Toyota, IBM, Samsung, Amazon, Mercedes-Benz, and GE comprise the rest of brands included in Interbrand’s Top 10 list.

With Google unveiling new Pixel phones equipped with the Google Assistant and Apple updating iOS 10 to add to Siri's powers, Samsung is now stepping up its assistant game by snapping up an up-and-coming artificial intelligence platform. And it's one developed by the original creators of Siri. Credit: VivSamsung said today (Oct. 5) that it's buying Viv, an AI platform that the electronics giant intends to use as the basis for an AI-based open ecosystem across its devices and services. In a press release announcing the purchase, Samsung said Viv would continue to operate independently under the team that also created Siri, which is now integrated into Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems. Credit: VivMore MORE: 12 Best Android Apps You're Not Using Viv started getting buzz earlier this year as a would-be Siri competitor not only because of its founders' resumés, but also because it promises to be a more open platform for connecting with outside apps and services. Viv's other major selling point is its ease of use. Viv's creators are designing the AI agent to be more conversational, giving it the ability to handle multiple requests at once. Viv Demo Samsung currently has a voice-powered assistant of sorts on some of its devices. S Voice lets you operate phones like the Galaxy S7 or Note 7 with just your voice, dialing contacts and dictating text messages. But its powers are far short of what you can do with assistants like the ones from Google, Apple and Microsoft. It sounds Viv is going to give Samsung the opportunity to change that. In announcing the purchase, Samsung says Viv will help it simplify user interfaces and offer up appropriate suggestions and recommendations based on context — which sounds an awful lot like what Apple and Google are doing with their assistants on mobile devices. Samsung also talked about Viv's potential to integrate with its other products, including wearables and home appliances. We've got a ways to go before we see how Viv stacks up against other voice-driven assistants, since the platform is still in development. But it's clear Samsung has big plans. In an interview with Recode, Injong Rhee, Samsung's chief technology officer, promised that Samsung's investments in AI would be evident in next year's flagship Galaxy phones. Recode also reports that Samsung hopes to add the technology into television and other connected devices.

With stagnant user growth and continuing losses, Twitter's board agreed last month to consider a sale, and has told potential acquirers it wants such deliberations to conclude by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Technology website Recode reported later on Wednesday that Alphabet Inc's Google, long considered the most logical buyer for Twitter, and Walt Disney Co would not bid for the social network, leaving cloud software company Salesforce.com as the only known suitor. Twitter shares fell as much as 19.2 percent to $20.10, valuing the company at about $14.2 billion. They closed 20.1 percent lower at $19.87. Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff has publicly expressed his interest in Twitter in recent days, but stopped short of saying the company had decided on a bid. Analysts said he downplayed the possibility in a meeting with investors on Wednesday, sending Salesforce shares up about 4 percent. "I'm not saying I'm buying it, but I'm not saying I'm not buying it," Benioff said on Wednesday in an interview with the New York Times. Even at $20, Twitter shares are well above the $14 they were trading at before speculation about a possible acquisition began to emerge this spring. Many investors and analysts believe Twitter remains expensive for most potential buyers, but the company does not have a clear back-up plan if it is not acquired. Product initiatives under CEO Jack Dorsey, who returned to the company a year ago but also remains CEO of payment company Square, have borne little fruit. Large amounts of employee stock and options are also considered an obstacle for some potential bidders. The rationale for Salesforce bidding on Twitter is not clear, said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a note to clients. Buying Twitter would reduce the value of Salesforce shares by about $11 through dilution, while increased debt could cut another $9.50 from the stock. Other potential bidders beyond Salesforce are taking a look at Twitter, CNBC said, citing sources. Apple Inc has also been rumored as a possible bidder, though Recode reported that Apple would not move forward.

The technology news website Recode cited unnamed sources close to the situation as saying Google will not be among those in the running to buy San Francisco-based Twitter. Other sources said that Twitter should have "low expectations" of Apple being among those vying to buy the company, Recode reported. Twitter shares, which had taken flight on the New York Stock Exchange early in the day and ended formal trading up nearly six percent, dove more than nine percent in after-market trades to $22.58. Long-simmering speculation that Twitter is putting itself up for sale has boiled over in recent weeks, with the share price buoyed by unconfirmed talk that business-cloud software titan Salesforce, Google and other Silicon Valley titans were expected to be suitors. Twitter and Google did not respond to AFP requests for comment. Twitter, which celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, has yet to make a profit. Co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as chief executive last year but has yet to ignite growth, with the number of users stagnating at slightly more than 300 million for several quarters. After falling to its lowest point ever earlier this year, Twitter shares were boosted recently on hopes the company will gain traction or a make a promising match with a suitor. Twitter was expected to begin accepting bids this week. The social messaging platform would be a big-ticket item, with its value based on the share price topping $17 billion on Wednesday, and the company likely to want a premium to be paid. No suitors have declared interest in Twitter publicly, however. The list of companies that may still seek to buy Twitter includes entertainment giant Disney, Microsoft, and the US telecom service Verizon.

They will be the first to launch with Android 7.1 Nougat, but many of the Pixels’ best features, such as the new Google Assistant, won’t appear on other Android devices, including Google’s own Nexus series, when the OS arrives. An Android 7.1 Nougat changelog leaked to Android Police shows which new features will appear in the upcoming operating system, as well as those that are Pixel-only. Google confirmed that the information is accurate is to TechCrunch. The absence of the AI-powered helper will come as disappointment to those who expected to see the Siri/Cortana/Alexa rival on every handset receiving Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Assistant is essentially a more advanced version of Google Now, able to engage in two-way conversations with users, perform complex tasks, and learn and recall personal information from previous conversations for context. Other Pixel exclusives include the free, unlimited photo and video (in their original quality) cloud backup service; the smart storage feature, which automatically removes old, backed up images/videos when the storage is full; and the Pixel Camera and Launcher apps. 24-hour phone/chat support and screen-share functionality will also be limited to the Pixel phones. There are some interesting new features coming to all devices that receive Android 7.1, though. There’s the Night Light blue filter, which changes the color temperature of a display at night. A Daydream VR mode is also on its way, along with support for sliding down on the fingerprint sensor to open the notification bar. Google did say that its Assistant would eventually be arriving on other Android devices, just don’t expect it soon. Ultimately, the company will likely replace Google Now with its more advanced version of the assistant. "Our goal is to make the Google Assistant widely available to users, and we’ll continue to launch new surfaces over the course of the next year," a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. The developer preview of Android 7.1 arrives later this month. Google hasn’t said when it will come to phones other than the Pixel.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      Twitter Inc. shares plunged on Thursday as fears mounted that a much-anticipated auction of the social media company will draw minimal interest from potential buyers. With stagnant user growth and continuing losses, Twitter's board agreed last month to consider a sale, and has told potential acquirers it wants such deliberations to conclude by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Technology website Recode reported later on Wednesday that Alphabet Inc.'s Google, long considered the most logical buyer for Twitter, and Walt Disney Co. would not bid for the social network, leaving cloud software company Salesforce.com as the only known suitor. Twitter shares fell as much as 19.2 percent to $20.10, valuing the company at about $14.2 billion. They closed 20.1 percent lower at $19.87. Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff has publicly expressed his interest in Twitter in recent days, but stopped short of saying the company had decided on a bid. Analysts said he downplayed the possibility in a meeting with investors on Wednesday, sending Salesforce shares up about 4 percent. "I'm not saying I'm buying it, but I'm not saying I'm not buying it," Benioff said on Wednesday in an interview with the New York Times. Even at $20, Twitter shares are well above the $14 they were trading at before speculation about a possible acquisition began to emerge this spring. Many investors and analysts believe Twitter remains expensive for most potential buyers, but the company does not have a clear back-up plan if it is not acquired. Product initiatives under CEO Jack Dorsey, who returned to the company a year ago but also remains CEO of payment company Square, have borne little fruit. Large amounts of employee stock and options are also considered an obstacle for some potential bidders. The rationale for Salesforce bidding on Twitter is not clear, said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a note to clients. Buying Twitter would reduce the value of Salesforce shares by about $11 through dilution, while increased debt could cut another $9.50 from the stock.   Other potential bidders beyond Salesforce are taking a look at Twitter, CNBC said, citing sources. Apple Inc. has also been rumored as a possible bidder, though Recode reported that Apple would not move forward. © 2016 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google should never have promised Nexus upgrades Chris Burns - Oct 6, 2016 13 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google Nexus smartphones are still for sale by Google as of the release of this article – or at least they would appear to be, at first. If one searches for Google Nexus devices in Google’s own search engine, the page Google dot com slash Nexus still shows Google Nexus smartphones, including both the 5X and the 6P. “BUY NOW” buttons are also still in play, allowing the user to select which color device they’d like, only then to be sent to the Google Store’s standard front page, which is currently stocked up full of everything “Made by Google”, including Pixel phones but no Nexus. Google’s new aim, fairly clearly, is to become the best bits of all of what have suddenly become their competitors. They’ve got alternate reality versions of the Samsung Gear VR, the iPhone, and Amazon Echo with Alexa. With that, they’ve appeared to usher their Nexus devices right out of their online store completely. Or nearly completely. Whenever a company selling Android devices promises that they’ll be delivering Android software updates to a new device for a specified period of time, and they don’t, Android fans get angry. Not just owners of the devices themselves, but the Android community as a whole seems to get angry. Case in point: the Verizon version of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. This device was supposed to look and act like the rest of the Nexus family, software support and all, but it carried a whole lot of Verizon software inside, and updates came sometimes weeks after the carrier-free version (and even alternate carrier versions). Now there’s a rumbling about how Google’s Pixel smartphones wont be especially different from Nexus devices with quick updates. It’s not the OS updates that Google is promising, or has promised. It’s the idea that the updates will arrive, at some point. Meanwhile, the Nexus line has not been left behind, we hope. Google still has the Nexus 6 listed as attaining Android version updates through October of this year, while the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P are still set to receive updates through September of 2017. Google seems to still be suggesting that the last day a device is on the Google Store will have nothing to do with its Android version update schedule. Instead, as it’s been for a while now, “Nexus devices get Android version updates for at least 2 years from when the device became available on the Google Store. After 2 years, we can’t guarantee additional updates.” There is one place where the last date the device was sold matters – in Security patches. According to Google, “Nexus devices get security patches for at least 3 years from when the device first became available, or at least 18 months from when the Google Store last sold the device, whichever is longer.” Google hasn’t made any promises for the Pixel for software updates any different than they have for Nexus devices. The Pixel is guaranteed to come with Android 7.1 Nougat, as well as 2-years of OS updates and 3-years of security updates. Same deal. In writing, Google’s promises seem to be holding strong. Google making any sort of promise on how quickly Android updates will arrive on a smartphone will result in the most hyper-fanatical Android fans suggesting they’ve lost faith in the company every time their device does not receive and update at the same time as (or before) everyone else’s. When Apple shipped iOS 10, they did so for every iPhone released all the way back to the year 2012. That includes the iPhone 5, a phone four generations back. Apple released this update to all of these phones, on all carriers, all in the same 24-hour period. Will this claim be able to be made by Google in a few years’ time? Google’s promise is for 2-years of OS upgrades. Is it important that the company attempt to live up to the scale at which Apple updates their smartphone lineup? For some, it’s vital. While iOS and Android are relatively different software experiences, choosing between smartphones can be all about how often they feel they’re getting the newest software features from their manufacturing company. For others, it couldn’t matter less. Just so long as they feel safe using their phone – security updates, that is – they’ll be fine without a 7.1.xx update every few weeks. If the phone works, it works.

Sure, they are missing some features, like a proper water-resistant body. But don't let that bog you down. It won't be amiss to say that they are a fine pair, good enough to compete with the other phones in their price range. They have some features that no other phone, not the iPhone 7 and neither the Galaxy S7, have. The Pixel and the Pixel XL are the high-end premium phones, directly from Google, and they look good enough to shake up the market. But an issue that is bigger than the missing features with the Pixel and the Pixel is the fate of the current Nexus phones. On the night Google announced the Pixel phones, it also seems to have abandoned the Nexus users. Also Read: Pixel, Pixel XL: Google's phones should make Apple, Samsung et al nervous Until Pixel and Pixel XL appeared in the Google Play store, their position was occupied by the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P. But now the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P, less than a year old and still available in the market, have been booted out of the prime position they occupied in the world of Google. And consequently, the Nexus users have suddenly become the second class citizens in the Android ecosystem. A promise was madeGoogle calls Pixel and Pixel XL its first phones. Or rather the first phones designed and engineered by the Google's hardware team in-house. That is only partially true. The company earlier designed, engineered and sold Motorola phones at a time when Motorola was owned by Google. It also took ownership of Nexus phones, which were (and are) for practical purposes Google's own phone.   This ownership of Nexus phones by Google was one of the big reasons why people bought Nexus phones. When Google announced the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P last year, the company took full ownership of the phone. "While we love all the Android devices out there, every year we build Nexus devices to show off the latest and greatest, directly from the people who built Android," said Hiroshi Lockheimer, who heads the Android division at the company. The promise was clear: if you bought the Nexus phone, you were buying a phone that would get Android updates and new features for at least 18 months, directly from Google without any delay Then there was the way Google pitched the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P to consumers. "Always fresh, best in mobile. From the folks who built Android," the company highlighted on the product pages of the phones. "Built to get the best out of the world's most popular OS, Nexus is the ultimate Android experience. You're always among the first to receive software and security updates."   The promise was clear: if you bought the Nexus phone, you were buying the Google phone, a phone that would get Android updates and new features for at least 18 months, directly from Google without any delay and before anyone else. Yes, a lot of these new features would also reach the users of other Android phones. But for that there was no guarantee. But for current-generation Nexus phones, this guarantee was there. And it came directly from Google. A promise brokenBut on Tuesday night as Google unveiled the Pixel and the Pixel XL, it broke that promise. Now, the Nexus users are the second-class citizens and the Pixel users are the VIPs. From now onwards, it will be the Pixel users who will get the latest version of Android before anyone else and get the unique Android features that Google will not release for any other phone, not even for its own Nexus phones.   It is understandable if this has happened 18 months after the launch of Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P. Once that 18-month period was over, Google's liability would have ended. But in this case, it is just utterly weird and seems unfair to Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P users. These are current generation phones. Until the launch of the Pixel and the Pixel XL a couple of days go, these were the best phones that Google was selling. Yet, the Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5X will not get the Android 7.1, which is the latest version of Android and comes with features like Google Assistant, new animations, and a few other enhancements, for another few months even though the Pixel and the Pixel XL are rocking it. And even when it hits the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P, it will come in developer preview version. At the same time, even though it will be Android 7.1, it will possibly lack some of the coolest features like Assistant, Smart Storage, Pixel Launcher. These features will be exclusive to Pixel phones. Now some of this exclusive stuff -- the camera features, for example -- may require specific hardware and hence are only suitable for Pixel phones. That is understandable. But Google's decision to withhold a few software features from the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P is baffling to say the least. Also Read: Google Nexus is dead, so very very dead. And we should all mourn For a company that is pitching a premium phone in the market, it is also a rather surprising move, The Nexus users were the biggest fans of the Google's Android phones. That is the reason why they bought the Nexus phones, at a time when phones sold by other companies offered better hardware and cooler-looking features at similar prices. Yet, Google is leaving the biggest Android fans high-and-dry by (kind of) ditching the Nexus phones.   For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in.ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.   Most Read Slow Jio 4G speed: Here's a method to increase Jio speed but why bother WhatsApp now rolls out video calling feature, for now in beta Jio 4G may remain free until March 2017: Report 32 lakh ATM cards hacked: Is your debit card safe and should you change PIN?

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink ‘Content needs to be compelling’ Prasad Sangameshwaran   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Simon Kahn, CMO of Google Asia-Pacific Be it long duration or super-short ads, small shop or big brand, convey the message well, says Simon Kahn, CMO of Google Asia-Pacific At every event that promotes the digital medium, there are enough and more success stories that are cited about brands using the digital medium to their advantage. Invariably, all of these examples are of the large brands. In an interview with cat.a.lyst, Simon Kahn, CMO of Google Asia-Pacific, speaks about the democratisation of marketing through online content and how Google is reaching consumers across the pop-strata with newer technologies If digital media was the great level playing field, then why don’t we hear enough about smaller brands who used the digital media to their advantage? Actually, I would not think that’s the case. There are many examples of smaller brands which were able to harness digital media, particularly video, to demonstrate their product and the brand ethos. You could be a small shop down the street. But if you put together something that’s compelling, and it’s targeted well at the consumers you want to tap, the results can be incredibly effective. Historically, one of the big challenges that even medium-sized brands have had is in developing the right online assets. What we are seeing now is that the ecosystem is starting to develop. The technology is getting better where you can create that content at a lower cost as well. In digital marketing, is targeting the right audience more difficult than creating compelling content? In that scenario, could the amplification of content take a sizeable share of the budget, thus giving an advantage to the larger companies? I think both can be achieved. Creating compelling content requires great insight, understanding of customers and an ability to translate that into something that really resonates with consumers. Now you might be working for a large company or a small brand, but there have been cases of both creating compelling content. In targeting the content, there is a lot of data involved in reaching the right set of customers. Both large and small companies can achieve it if they do it methodically. The first thing that a small or medium brand would want is to be recognised by their target group. Once your brand is known, then you can build attributes that convey the products and services that you want to sell. Before you even worry about creating compelling content, you should pay attention to the basics — like a website that’s mobile-friendly. Increasingly what’s becoming important is to create a relationship and conversation with customers. That’s why, it’s not about advertising but about creating interesting videos or other online content that helps customers and gives them a reason to come back and engage with your brand. That’s something you could classify as compelling content but you cannot call it an amazing ad. However, it can create a large impact as it helps the customer. When ideas are completely out-of-the-box, doesn’t amplification help in the target audience identifying with the idea, like the case of a tea brand using transgenders? Amplification certainly helps. You can put a lot of money into amplification, but again, if you pick the wrong channel, nothing will be effective. When we often hear that long-format videos work well on digital media like YouTube, why is the channel looking at bring down the duration of the commercial to six seconds with YouTube Go. Isn’t that the opposite of creating long-form advertising content? Will it impact revenues? Actually, the good thing about YouTube is that long form works wonderfully and super-short works wonderfully. The ones in the middle have historically not done as well. if we look at Asia-Pacific, the average duration of the best ads is four minutes. If you look at American insurance company Geiko, it has done these amazing 15-second ads that really draw you in to see what really happened. I think super-short can be quite effective. It’s really the first four-five seconds where you have to create impact and grab the customer’s attention. With the six-second ad, virtually every ad on YouTube Go becomes a paid ad, unlike the earlier version where advertisers did not pay for ads that were skipped? With YouTube Go, the True View is not an ad format that makes sense. We still need to monetise the platform. We still need to pay YouTube creators. Most importantly, we believe that it’s great for consumers, as it’s a product that really works well for them. The war seems to be on bringing down data costs for customers. Whatever Reliance Jio promises to do with 4G, Google seems to be attempting even with a 2G network. Is the vision to deliver data faster and better despite the bottlenecks in the network? I think that what we want to do is what resonates and works best with consumers. We have a variety of consumers — some have big data plans, are less price-sensitive, have access to better networks and are fine with heavy data consumption products. We have products that work for them. One of the things we have done in the last couple of years is to also look at the needs of consumers who are cost-conscious, have access to slower networks.

Home Fe columnist Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone: It begins with the battle for the smartphone Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone: It begins with the battle for the smartphone Almost close to a decade ago, at the Macworld Conference and Expo in San Francisco, Steve Jobs took the mobile handset device world by storm with the launch of the iPhone, a device that combined three products... By: Anup Jayaram | Published: October 6, 2016 7:22 PM Google has managed to achieve something that only Apple has till now done – integrating devices and software to build a powerful ecosystem. Almost close to a decade ago, at the Macworld Conference and Expo in San Francisco, Steve Jobs took the mobile handset device world by storm with the launch of the iPhone, a device that combined three products – a mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls and an internet communications device. That after various iterations is now the iPhone7 that was launched early this September. But, despite accounting for almost 16% – 225 million of the 1.4 billion smartphones shipped globally – of the worldwide smartphone sales in 2015, tricky times could be ahead for Apple. It has seen sales of the iPhone falling from 183.16 million devices in the first three quarters of 2015 to166.38 million in 2016. Revenues from iPhone sales too fell from $122.8 billion in 2015 to $ 108.5 in 2016 over the same period. While that is an internal issue, things could get tricky for Apple with the launch of the Google Pixel. The reasons are not hard to find. For starters, the $ 75 billion Google has managed to achieve something that only Apple has till now done – integrating devices and software to build a powerful ecosystem. Samsung which developed the OS Tizen has not been able to ensure that it is an integral part of devices. The commonalities with Apple are just too many. While the Apple OS – iOS – is a walled garden, the Google OS – Android is open source. Among the biggest users of the Android OS is Samsung, the world’s single largest smartphone vendor. Apple also changed the smartphone paradigm by introducing apps through its App Store. Google has the Play Store which has Android versions of all apps. Also, since the Android user base is much higher, no app developer can ignore it. While having many apps is good, it ended up eating real estate on the mobile device. Apple solved that to a large extent by allowing users to tap into the iCloud. Google has done just that. It is offering Pixel users unlimited cloud storage for full-resolution photos and video. With the world going in for artificial intelligence (AI), iPhone has the voice-activated Siri, while Google has the Assistant. Very soon, Indian users will be able to use the Hindi version of the Assistant. While the commonalities end here, the advantage that Google has is that it can tap into its parent Alphabet that has multiple projects going. This includes connected cars, connected homes and Nest. What that means is that over the next 10 years, the car that drives you – as opposed to you driving the car – will be powered by software, and be powered by renewable energy. The stakes are quite high for both. But, it’s a battle that could lead to making life a lot more easier for a lot of people. Please Wait while comments are loading...

New dev preview now live What's new in Android 7.1? New features to get excited about by Max Parker 20 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments What’s new in Android 7.1 Nougat? Along with the launch of the Pixel and Pixel XL – plus 4K Chromecast and Home – Google very quietly unveiled the next version of Android. Nougat version 7.1 is currently only available on the two Pixel phones, but Google has now rolled out a new dev preview for the Nexus 6P, 5X, and Pixel C. That means owners of those handsets and tablet will be able to get an early look at Nougat 7.1 ahead of a full launch later this year. The preview should be automatically downloaded for those enrolled in the Android Beta programme, but you could download the entire factory image as a TGZ file and flash the image to a phone, or download the OTA zip file. If you don't know what either of those last two methods means, we reccomend sticking with signing up to the Beta programme. Before following any of these methods, we reccomend backing up your device, just in case. Of course, what you get with the final update will depend on which phone you own. See, what’s in Android 7.1 on the new Pixel phones is very different to what will be in Android 7.1 on a Nexus 6P or Moto Z. Related: When will your phone get Android 7? Android 7.1 release date: Q4 2016 Hands-on with the Google Pixel and Pixel XL Android 7.1 on Pixel and Pixel XL It shouldn’t be a surprise that Google’s latest flagship gets top billing when it comes to features. Both of these phones come with Nougat 7.1 installed, and with lots of exclusive features. Here are some of the best: • Pixel Launcher (including new icons, altered search box, weather widget, and new app drawer) – looks like this will be exclusive for a while, which is a shame • Google Assistant – Hardly surprising as this one of the Pixel’s biggest selling features  • Unlimited original quality photo and video upload  • Phone and Chat support  • Exclusive Pixel camera app – this feature some Pro modes, video stabilisation, HDR+ image, and Smartburst  • Filled nav buttons  • Wallpaper picker  There are a lot of nice features here, and most of them are the big selling points of the Pixel and Pixel XL. It’s also a different tactic from Google, who previously let pretty much any Android phone uses its own apps. It’s a kick in the teeth for Nexus 6P and 5X owners, certainly. Non-exclusive 7.1 features Exclusive features aside, these are the features that will be standard in 7.1: • Night Light mode  • Improvement to touch displays  • Seamless updates  (depending on your phone's hardware) • Daydream VR mode (will need a supported phone)  So, it seems clear that Android 7.1 is heavily focused on Pixel phones, but hopefully the Pixel exclusive features won't stay that way for too long. WATCH: Google's event in under three minutes 0 shares Read Comments toboev October 8, 2016, 1:57 pm "Nougat version 7.1 should be available later in the year (probably before most phones have actually got Nougat)" Did I read that right? Nougat will be available before most phones have got Nougat. So most phones won't have Nougat before Nougat is available. And that's news? Doh, I get it now.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close 123rf.com Twitter shares plunge on report bidders are scarce Reuters Oct 6, 2016 (…) 123rf.com Shares of Twitter Inc. plunged on Thursday as fears mounted that a much-anticipated auction of the social media company will draw minimal interest from potential buyers. With stagnant user growth and continuing losses, Twitter’s board agreed last month to consider a sale, and has told potential acquirers that it wants such deliberations to conclude by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Technology website Recode reported later on Wednesday that Alphabet Inc.’s Google, long considered the most logical buyer for Twitter, and Walt Disney Co. would not bid for the social network, leaving cloud software company Salesforce.com as the only known suitor. Twitter shares fell 20.1 percent on Thursday to close at $19.87, valuing the company at $13.9 billion. Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff has publicly expressed his interest in Twitter in recent days, but stopped short of saying the company had decided on a bid. Analysts said he downplayed the possibility in a meeting with investors on Wednesday, sending Salesforce shares up about 4 percent. “I’m not saying I’m buying it, but I’m not saying I’m not buying it,” Benioff said on Wednesday in an interview with the New York Times. Even at $20, Twitter shares are well above the $14 they were trading at before speculation about a possible acquisition began to emerge this spring.

Product initiatives under CEO Jack Dorsey, who returned to the company a year ago but also remains CEO of payment company Square, have borne little fruit. Large amounts of employee stock and options are also considered an obstacle for some potential bidders. The rationale for Salesforce bidding on Twitter is not clear, said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a note to clients. Buying Twitter would reduce the value of Salesforce shares by about $11 through dilution, while increased debt could cut another $9.50 from the stock. Other potential bidders beyond Salesforce are taking a look at Twitter, CNBC said, citing sources. Apple Inc. has also been rumored as a possible bidder, though Recode reported that Apple would not move forward. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Google Pixel Battery Life Is 40% Higher than Nexus Smartphones GO Google Pixel XL comes with a 3,450mAh battery Oct 6, 2016 13:35 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Battery life is one of the most important aspects of any smartphone, especially if it belongs to a premium range. Google’s Pixel XL has a battery capacity of 3,450mAh, while the Pixel has 2,770mAh. A Reddit user has created a table comparing battery life on two Nexus smartphones with battery autonomy on Pixel and Pixel XL phones. Nexus 5X and Pixel have almost the same battery capacity, but the latter seems to have a 2.6% bigger battery than the 5X. This provides the Google-branded phone with an increased standby time of 456 hours, which is 36 hours more than what Nexus 5X can offer. Talk time on the Pixel is 26 hours, compared to 20 hours on the Nexus 5X. In addition, Internet use on Wi-Fi and LTE is considerably longer on the Pixel, while users can spend 30% more time playing videos and audio on Google’s latest smartphone compared to last year’s Nexus 5X. Battery life on Pixel XL is significantly higher than on Nexus 6P Besides the numbers for the comparison between Pixel and Nexus 5X, the table also shows stats regarding the Pixel XL and Nexus 6P, which was also released last year. The two smartphones have the same battery capacity, but standby time is 25.5% higher on the Pixel XL. Additionally, talk time on the recently-released device is 39.1% higher, while Internet use on Wi-Fi, LTE and video playback are also 40% higher on the Pixel XL. Owners of Google's latest phone can spend 30 hours more playing audio on their phones, compared to Nexus 6P users. It’s worth mentioning that the numbers were released by Google and they don’t necessarily reflect real life use. Still, Google does apply the same battery tests on its devices so the numbers aren’t quite dismissible. This impressive performance is mostly due to the latest Qualcomm processor found inside Pixel smartphones, Snapdragon 821. The SoC is said to be two times faster than the SD810, used in Nexus 6P. SD821 is coupled with Adreno 530 graphics processing unit, which takes up 40% less power than the Adreno 430 GPU mounted on the Nexus 6P. Android 7.1 Nougat also comes with some battery life improvements, although they make a difference only in standby mode. #Google#Pixel#Pixel XL#Nexus 6P#Nexus 5X subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Pixel Phones Come With Few Pre-Installed Verizon Apps Google Pixel and Pixel XL Phones Will Work on Republic Wireless Network Google Expected to Sell 4 Million Pixel Smartphones This Year Pixel Smartphones Offered with $100 Gift Card at Best Buy 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background    Battery life comparison between Pixel phones, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P New Android APKs Navbar Apps APK: Updated November 13th, 17:48 GMT MiXplorer APK: Updated November 13th, 17:46 GMT Periscope APK: Updated November 13th, 17:43 GMT XDA Labs APK: Updated November 13th, 17:38 GMT Game Tools APK: Updated November 13th, 17:35 GMT SoundHound APK: Updated November 13th, 17:33 GMT Microsoft Classroom APK: Updated November 13th, 17:17 GMT Reader comments Pictures and Specs of Google's Canned Project ARA Smartphone Leaked Out more on: Project Ara i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Image: IIEA On both sides of the Atlantic, we’re seeing dramatic investments in renewable energy and a rise in interesting, innovative products in the home. The future? Selling power to your neighbour. Renewable energy production is growing at around 30pc every year in the US. Solar farms are growing, public interest is growing and traditional energy production is being phased out. That’s according to Julia Hamm, CEO of the Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA) in the US, who is enthusiastic about a shift in her organisation from parochial solar advocates into a representative body of a more integrated, established industry. State of affairs Hamm is in Ireland today (6 October) to discuss the future of energy production at an Institute of International and European Affairs event in Dublin. She spoke to Siliconrepublic.com about how mature the renewables industry has become in the US, though it’s far from running the energy show just yet. “Solar is driven by specific states, based on a variety of factors,” she said, namechecking California, Hawaii, Arizona, Nevada, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts as prime adopters to date. There, the growth in solar panels on rooftops has proved notable. Interestingly, it is in some of these states that Google’s own solar power tool, Project Sunroof, is starting to take off. San Francisco, Fresno and Boston were the early-stage pilots for a service that establishes who might benefit from solar energy. So successful was the trial that it soon expanded out to Arizona, Nevada, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina and Colorado. ‘The scale in China is way larger than anything we’ve seen in the United States’ JULIA HAMM You pop in your address and Google will work out your house’s solar value, list potential suppliers and work out the savings you could make, if any. To measure the sunlight, Google’s analytics looks at the number of hours the sun hits your roof, considering key metrics like which way your house faces, shaded regions and trees. You can put in your average electricity bills and it will work out the savings behind going solar. The next wave “The next wave of technology we’re seeing pick up speed is energy storage,” said Hamm, as she described “a device for consumers, that is essentially a combination of rooftop energy as well as storage”. “There are even examples of rooftop solar, plus storage, plus a smart thermostat, plus water heating, all in one combination,” Hamm explained. Something similar is happening in Germany, one of the countries home to the more innovative of renewable projects. LichtBlick is a German company working on some pretty incredible products, notably its wonderfully named Schwarm Dirigent service. Surmising that single households can become energy facilities, and many house owners would not be able to tailor energy generation accurately, Schwarm Dirigent finds a way for people to sell off excess electricity to neighbours. Undercutting primary energy suppliers, and doing it all ‘green’, the idea is really impressive. From solar to smart When products like this emerge, it makes sense that Hamm’s organisation changed its first word from solar to smart. “Historically, the bridge between traditional electricity and new solar electricity has been a wide one,” she said. “As we see higher and higher penetration of solar, we need to think more holistically. We need to integrate it into the system.” Given the thirst for capitalist models in the US, various ways to get solar electricity into regional grids have emerged. One such way is the practice of utility providers getting customers to invest in solar farms not even built on their land, rewarded with electricity credits as energy generated through their investment rises. However, this is all small-scale in comparison to what’s happening in China. In the first quarter of 2015, China added more than 5GW of clean energy to its entire grid, more than all of France’s equivalent solar infrastructure. There are even proposals for solar plants in space. “The scale over there is way larger than anything we’ve seen in the US,” said Hamm, who said single solar farms totalling 2GW in electricity generation in China dwarfs what the US can do. “The trend in the US is towards smaller systems,” she said. “The sweet spot on larger projects seems to be moving towards 5MW-20MW systems. They’re easier to manage and build.” Changing of the guard “In the US, if you look at the new additions of power plants in the US last year, the significant majority were in renewables, the rest were gas,” said Hamm. Beyond solar, there are other industries helping to drive this globally. While the US is split into three areas in general (solar in the areas named above, wind in the east and hydro in the pacific west), Ireland is playing its own role. Today, it was announced that the wind industry in Ireland will grow to such a degree in the next three years that an additional 25pc of workers will be needed to satisfy demand. That’s due to almost one-quarter of the country’s energy requirement already being satisfied by wind, with a further €2.5bn being poured into the industry in the near future. The trend is only going one way and, driven by industry, it will see renewables produce more energy than fossil fuels before we run out of the latter. “I’m confident of that,” said Hamm.

That was how Google's boss, Sundar Pichai, began a presentation on Tuesday, at which his company unveiled a range of new hardware products. He believes that the key attraction of both the new Pixel smartphones and the Google Home smart speaker is the company's expertise in artificial intelligence as demonstrated by the Google Assistant. The search company believes that the vast amount of data it has collected over the years, coupled with its expertise in machine learning, will give it a head start in the coming AI battle. Image copyright Google Image caption Google Assistant can find information, carry out tasks and control other internet-connected kit The company hopes that Google Assistant, a conversational chatbot or virtual PA, will soon be a key feature on all sorts of Android devices, not just those it makes itself. If Mr Pichai has his way, we will soon be shouting: "OK Google," to get all sorts of information and services. But on Thursday came news that showed that the biggest player on Android may not be so keen on that idea. Samsung has announced that it is buying Viv, an artificial intelligence company started by the same people who created the virtual assistant Siri, and then sold it to Apple. Media captionViv, the voice-controlled virtual assistant, was demoed in May Viv, according to Samsung, is "a unique, open artificial intelligence platform that gives third-party developers the power to use and build conversational assistants and integrate a natural language-based interface into renowned applications and services". That appears to be a pretty good description of what Google is doing with its AI. But it sounds as though Samsung may decide that Viv will be a key differentiator on its Galaxy phones - and vast range of household appliances - as it battles to retain its position at the top end of the Android market in competition with the Google Pixel. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Samsung has a wide range of electronics that could benefit from Viv, in addition to its handsets And other technology giants are flexing their own AI muscles. Apple of course has Siri, Microsoft has Cortana, and IBM's Watson has been around for a while and is beginning to make its presence felt in a number of commercial applications. We also learned on Thursday UK lenders Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest would use chatbots based on Watson to answer simple customer queries. Image copyright RBS Image caption IBM Watson's virtual agent is able to understand and learn from human interactions Then there is Alexa, the AI at the heart of Amazon's voice-controlled Echo speaker. Amazon has opened up the Alexa platform to outside developers, and there are already a few Alexa-powered devices out there in the market. The Echo is in only a few million homes so far, but talking to her (it?) is already proving a compelling example of the promise - and current limitations - of an AI conversational program. Alexa is pretty good at understanding what you are saying, but not so smart at dealing with follow-up questions. Media captionAmazon says its Echo speakers were inspired by Star Trek And this is where Google believes its AI has an edge, saying its Assistant has contextual awareness that allows it to carry on a conversation beyond an initial question. The company gives as an example the query: "Who is the current British prime minister?" Try this out with Google, Alexa and Apple's Siri, and all three will produce the answer: "Theresa May". But follow up with: "How old is she?" and Siri says: "I'm afraid I couldn't find anything on 'How old is she?'" while Alexa tells you she does not understand the question. But the Google Assistant knows you are referring to Mrs May and comes back with: "Theresa May is 60 years old." Of course, we are at the very early stages of this revolution, and much may change as each AI learns by doing. What is more, none of them has yet convinced a significant number of people that conversing with a smart device is something really useful rather than a bit of fun, which you try and then forget. Both Amazon and Google are betting that this moment comes when we walk through the front door and say: "OK Google, turn on the lights," or: "Alexa, turn up the heat in the hallway." Now we know that Samsung and perhaps IBM's Watson may also be competing to give us similarly compelling AI experiences. Image copyright Apple Image caption Siri can be used on Apple's TV set-top box, but the company does not have a voice-activated speaker The mystery is what Apple is up to. Siri first came to the iPhone five years ago, providing the first experience of a virtual assistant for many. Since then, while the program has appeared on more Apple devices, and is now on its desktop Macs, it has failed to define this new category. Where is the Siri speaker or Siri car? You can be certain that hundreds, perhaps thousands of artificial intelligence experts are at work in Cupertino. But exactly what ambition Apple has to be a key player in the AI future remains unclear.

That same year, consumer spending on VR headsets will reach $7.9 billion and spending on VR entertainment will hit $3.3 billion. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161006005521/en/ New analysis and forecasts on the VR market were released today by IHS Markit INFO, +0.51% a world leader in critical information, analytics and solutions, in a new report Virtual Reality Market Opportunity Report 2016. “While the VR headset installed base will escalate significantly to 81 million by 2020, we predict that expensive, higher-end headsets will dominate content monetisation,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, director of games analysis at IHS Technology. “There will be a polarization of the VR market between lower volume premium VR headsets, which will have strong paid content conversion rates, and higher-volume cheaper smartphone VR headsets, which will monetise content at a lower rate.” Market opportunity “Smartphone VR headsets will represent the largest addressable market for VR content because of cheaper pricing. The smartphone VR base will be a major opportunity for VR content experimentation,” said Ian Fogg, senior director at IHS Technology. “Smartphone VR headsets’ share of the VR installed base will be 87 percent at the end of 2016.” Consumer spending on VR headsets will be $1.6 billion in 2016, bolstered heavily by the launch of high-end headsets from Oculus, HTC and Sony. This will drive average sales price of all headsets to close to $85 from $26 in 2015. The average selling price is expected to climb sharply once again in 2017 to $191 as high-end headsets sell more, the IHS Technology report said. Meanwhile, consumer spending on VR entertainment is forecast to hit $310 million in 2016, growing to $3.3 billion in 2020, as the high-end headsets gain more traction. “A $3.3 billion VR entertainment market by 2020 will represent less than 1 percent of overall entertainment spending worldwide,” Harding-Rolls said. “There is certainly more to be done in terms of premium content for VR platforms and it will take time to deliver on the potential of the technology.” Samsung’s Gear VR to lead in 2016; Google’s Daydream View to counter IHS Technology forecasts Samsung’s Gear VR to have the largest installed base out of all the major branded headsets in 2016 with 5.4 million. However, the launch of Google’s Daydream View – Google’s next-generation smartphone VR headset – will slowly disrupt Samsung’s dominant market position in the smartphone VR market. While the high-price of Google’s Pixel phone means the 2016 impact will be small, IHS Technology forecasts that Google Daydream View will become the most popular headset for VR by 2019. Google will overtake Samsung’s Gear VR due to broad industry support, a compelling $79 price point and the delivery of a premium smartphone VR experience. Sony’s PlayStation VR to outsell high-end competitors IHS Technology forecasts Sony’s PlayStation VR will outsell Oculus Rift and HTC Vive combined in 2016, but will also be supply-constrained as the company plays it safe on stock inventory. In 2016, IHS Technology forecasts PlayStation VR will sell 1.4 million headsets and will generate $134 million in spending on VR entertainment, with the PC-based headsets generating $69 million. Crucially, PlayStation VR comes to market at a cheaper price point than the PC competition and is addressing a much larger audience of PlayStation 4 consoles than VR-ready PCs. The installed base of PS4s will reach 53 million by the end of 2016, compared to 16 million VR-ready consumer PCs. “Sony is well positioned to build an early lead in the high-end VR headset race because of its large addressable market of 53 million PS4s by the end of 2016, its lower total cost of ownership compared to the PC VR companies and its ability to get big franchises into VR,” Harding-Rolls said. “With VR content and users strongly aligned with the games market, Sony already has in place many of the components necessary to deliver to this new VR entertainment segment at the expense of its competitors.” About IHS Markit(www.ihsmarkit.com) IHS Markit INFO, +0.51% is a world leader in critical information, analytics and expertise to forge solutions for the major industries and markets that drive economies worldwide.

The Pixel and Pixel XL were manufactured by HTC, but these devices are 100% Google through and through. So how will the first ever “Phone by Google” sell? An analyst at Digitimes is estimating that Google will sell around 3-4 million Pixel phones before the end of 2016. That would be well under iPhone 7 sales and even sales of the fire hazard known as the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. But it’s also a respectable number for the first phone made by Google. The Verizon exclusivity will likely contribute to the low sales. Have you pre-ordered one of the Pixel phones yet? Do you plan on buying one after reviews?

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Lenovo Phab 2 Pro AR-ready Project Tango phone coming out in November Mobile Phones Lenovo Phab 2 Pro AR-ready Project Tango phone coming out in November By Bindu Nair - Lenovo’s Phab 2 Pro was unveiled to great excitement earlier this year, understandable given its status as the world’s first Project Tango phone. It was set to hit shelves this summer but was later postponed to September followed by fall. Impatient buyers will just have to wait a little while longer now to get their hands on the Phab 2 Pro. Google VR head Clay Bavor told CNET that the handset will go up for sale in the US in November. It’ll be priced at $499 unlocked. The timing is interesting since even the search giant’s latest Pixel phones will be available at around the same time. The Pixel and Pixel XL are notably the first smartphones which can support Google’s new Daydream virtual reality platform. On the other hand, the Lenovo offering focuses on augmented reality. Google effectively has high stakes in both technologies. Come November, consumers will have to decide whether they want to dip their toes into AR or VR. Also Read: Lenovo outs new range of Ideapad, Yoga laptops in India The Phab 2 Pro makes a compelling argument for the former. Users can utilize the device’s 3D depth-sensing and motion-tracking camera in conjunction with the 16MP lens to place virtual objects in the real world, just like Pokemon Go. Moreover, people can also do things like check out how furniture would look in a room and provide contextual data about objects. Take a quick look at the specifications of the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro: – OS: Android 6.0 Marshmallow – Display: 6.4-inch, 2560 x 1440 pixels – CPU: Snapdragon 652 Tango Edition – Storage: 64GB, expandable – RAM: 4GB – Camera: 16MP rear, 8MP front – Battery: 4050mAh Intriguingly, Bavor hinted that individuals might not have to make a choice between AR and VR in the future. This could indicate the development of a phone which supports both Tango and Daydream platforms.

But it doesn't mean what you think it means. Here's how to get it unlocked. Turns out you don't need to be on Verizon to buy Google Pixel 0 Share: Phones by Patrick Holland October 6, 2016 5:00 AM PDT Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech It turns out Verizon is not the only place to buy the Google Pixel or Pixel XL.Photo by James Martin/CNET You saw pictures this week of the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL. You want to buy one, but you read somewhere it's only available on Verizon. Is that true? To quote Walter Sobchak from "The Big Lebowski," "You're like a child who wanders into the middle of a movie." You're not sure what's going on. Let's start by clearing up this Verizon exclusive business. In the United States, the Google Pixel phones are available as exclusives through Verizon, both online and in its stores. However, that doesn't mean the Pixels will only work on Verizon's network. Usually, the word exclusive means "restricted or limited to." In this case, Verizon is the exclusive carrier selling the phone -- meaning, you can't buy one at an AT&T or Sprint store. However, you can buy a Pixel online through Verizon or the Google Store and use it on any major carrier. Just slap in another carrier's SIM card and you're good to go. Whether bought through Google or Verizon, "the phones are already unlocked," confirmed George Koroneos, who is on Verizon's corporate communications team. But if you try to preorder a Pixel on the Verizon website, it forces you to add a plan. So this would not be the best way to get a Pixel if you're not going to use it on Verizon. So here's my recommendation: If you're already on Verizon, buy the Pixel from Verizon. The company offers its customers up to $300 savings (in the form of account credit) for trading in an old device. If you're not on Verizon, buy the phone through the Google Store and choose whichever major carrier (AT&T, Sprint or T-Mobile) you want. It's a simple decision, really. The Pixel starts at $649 outright for the 32GB model (£599, AU$1,079). Both Google and Verizon offer financing for the Pixel. Verizon's financing is $24.08/month for 24 months and Google's is $24.04/month for 24 months. If you preorder the Pixel, both Verizon and Google will throw in the $79 Daydream View virtual reality headset for free. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are currently available for preorder and will be available in stores and online starting October 20. The Pixel and Pixel XL have what Google touts as the best phone camera.Photo by James Martin/CNET Tags Phones Google Verizon Related Stories BlackBerry has one more keyboard phone up its sleeve AT&T to throttle your video quality in the name of 'data saving' ​Apple now sells refurbished iPhones -- with a new battery The best phones you need to consider for 2016 Close   Discuss: Turns out you don't need to be on Verizon...

Google Pixel Phones Come with Fewer Pre-Installed Verizon Apps GO Only three Verizon apps are pre-installed on the phone Oct 6, 2016 13:05 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google’s latest smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, are offered by Verizon, the only US carrier to make these phones available to its customers. Unlocked versions of the two phones are available at the Google Store and multiple third-party retailers as well, including Best Buy, and through Google’s Project Fi. When purchasing a phone through a carrier, users also expect the mobile carrier to install multiple apps that take up space and ultimately can affect the phone’s performance. The purpose behind these pre-installed apps is to improve user experience, but not all people actually need or use them. Apparently, the Pixel smartphones listed on Verizon’s website don’t come with many pre-installed apps, as pointed by a user on Reddit. The mobile carrier claims on the Pixel listing on its website that the phones won’t come with any pre-installed apps from the carrier. However, three Verizon apps are mentioned under the preloaded Play Store apps tab. Apparently, the phones will come pre-installed with My Verizon, Go90, and VZ Messages. In case you were wondering, Go90 is a Verizon-branded video streaming app that offers access to live on-demand video wrapped in a social experience. HTC10 comes with 11 Verizon pre-installed apps When it comes to preloaded Google apps, there’s a whole list of apps that will be featured on Pixel phones, including Calendar, Downloads, Messenger, Camera, Contacts, Maps, Play Store, Gmail, YouTube, Chrome, Google, and many more. By comparison, HTC 10 offered by Verizon has a bunch of Verizon pre-installed apps, including Caller, Cloud, Mobile Hotspot, Emergency Alerts, VZ Navigator, Visual Voicemail, Verizon Protect. Actually, a total of 11 apps are pre-installed on the HTC10 listed on the carrier’s website. Google-branded smartphones and tablets are aimed at providing users with stock Android experience and it seems that Verizon has reduced the number of pre-installed apps so that it wouldn’t affect user experience. Unlocked Pixel phones will be the first to receive software updates from Google, but in the case of variants offered by Verizon, the updates might take longer to become available. #Google#Pixel#Pixel XL#Verizon#HTC 10 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Pixel and Pixel XL Phones Will Work on Republic Wireless Network Google Expected to Sell 4 Million Pixel Smartphones This Year Pixel Smartphones Offered with $100 Gift Card at Best Buy Pixel Is the First Smartphone to Arrive with Google Assistant on Board 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background    Pixel and Pixel XL New Android APKs Navbar Apps APK: Updated November 13th, 17:48 GMT MiXplorer APK: Updated November 13th, 17:46 GMT Periscope APK: Updated November 13th, 17:43 GMT XDA Labs APK: Updated November 13th, 17:38 GMT Game Tools APK: Updated November 13th, 17:35 GMT SoundHound APK: Updated November 13th, 17:33 GMT Microsoft Classroom APK: Updated November 13th, 17:17 GMT Reader comments Samsung Already Capable of Mass Producing Foldable Smartphones but It's Cautious more on: Samsung foldable phone i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.
