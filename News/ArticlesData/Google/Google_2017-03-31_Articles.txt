[Continuously updated] April Fools' Roundup: All the jokes from around the web Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 4:17pm PDTMar 31, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares211 Google News T-Mobile Videos Article Contents 1 Google Gnome 2 Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps 3 Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard 4 Google Assistant 5 Google Wind 6 Netflix Live 7 T-Mobile ONEsie 8 Hulu Hu 9 OnePlus Dash drink 10 Lyft Mono 11 Honor BFF 12 Google Haptic Helpers 13 Amazon Petlexa 14 Contour by SlickWraps 15 Nvidia GTX G-Assist 16 Google's data center on Mars April Fools Day is almost upon us, but some companies aren't waiting to share their pranks. Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrates to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. At the time of writing, it's still March 31 in some time zones, so we'll likely see more gags show up as time goes on.

Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?"

The Ordinary People star raged against ordinary fans getting priced out by the vultures on the One Show on Thursday night. But the Record can reveal that more than 800 tickets for his show at the SSE Hydro were already on sale on controversial sites such as Viagogo, Get Me In!, Seatwave and Stubhub – despite the official Ticketmaster sale only starting on Friday morning. Confused fans searching the internet for official tickets were further bamboozled by the secondary sales sites appearing higher up on Google searches than Ticketmaster. Read More Campaigners hail breakthrough in fight against ticket touts as Lords vote to tighten up rules for sellers US singer John Legend is set to perform at the SSE Hydro (Photo: PA) Even searching for “John Legend Ticketmaster” on Google throws up Viagogo and Ticketmaster’s own secondary site GetMeIn! higher in the listing. On the One Show, which ran a feature on the current crackdown against ticket touts in Parliament, US smoothie Legend slammed those using “botnet” software to harvest tickets: “We are getting feedback from our fans, who are asking why we are charging so much for tickets but we’re not charging £1000 per ticket. “It’s the resale sites that are charging this exorbitant amount and we want out fans to pay a fair market price for our show. “We don’t want these bots coming in and snatching up all the tickets and making them more scarce and selling them to the highest bidder and capturing the value and making it hard for people with regular incomes to come and see the show. Read More Daily Record campaign against ticket touts reaches Parliament but Viagogo don't show up to answer claims Touts are targeting the gig at the SSE Hydro (Photo: SNS Group) “It’s hard because you try all these codes and electronic ways to stop them but it’s still a challenge.” MP John Nicolson, a prominent voice at the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee’s inquiry into ticket abuse, slammed Google for putting profits before the interests of fans. He said: “It’s deeply disappointing that Google are still allowing invalid tickets sold through Viagogo to top John Legend online searches. “This despite the fact that witnesses at our recent Commons Select Committee hearings have told Google that fans could be turned away. “Viagogo don’t care. It looks increasingly as if Google don’t care either.” A spokesman for campaign group The FanFair Alliance slammed the touts who appear to be speculatively selling tickets before harvesting as many briefs as they can when the official sales start. Read More Music fans given 10-step guide on how to tackle ticket touts He said: “Thanks to the Record’s investigations, we are now gaining a much clearer picture of the type of operators who are bulk-selling tickets on the resale platforms. In most instances, the details raise more questions than answers. “These same operators must, presumably, also be managing to bulk-buy tickets at face value, before shifting them on in such large volumes and at such hike-up prices. “These so-called marketplaces are supposed to be trusted and transparent. Evidence would suggest they are anything but.” Read More Top news stories today 'Palace perv' was awarded MBE Keys calls for Sky Sports boycott Rapist strikes two days after release Sturgeon still can't call IndyRef2 Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @Daily_Record Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On John Legend Ticket touts The Hydro News all Most Read Most Recent UK & WorldMarried mum who had group sex with string of schoolboys at her home is jailed for seven years Amanda Tompkins sexually abused young boys while her own children were in the house.

As pranksters begin to unleash their best jokes around the world for the annual day of high jinks, Google didn't want to be left out of the fun.  The tech giant revealed a new feature on its Maps mobile app and for computers that makes getting lost when following directions that much easier. To celebrate April 1, people can now play the beloved Ms Pac-Man game while walking through the streets or just for fun.  Google released Ms Pac-Man for users to play while using its Maps feature for April Fools' Day on Saturday. Players can play the arcade game on their mobile phones or computers. The company first tried out the original maze game of Pac-Man exactly two years ago on Maps and it was wildly popular. Google announced the game on Facebook with the caption: 'She's a map-eater. And today, you can be one too.'   For playing the game on a mobile phone, click the pink button on the right.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'Z S L M N, there's silent letters at the end of that one':...

Share this article Share For iPhone users, players can pick the spot where they want the streets to turn into a game field but Android users are taken to a random spot in the world, The Verge reported. To play on the computer, the game icon will be on the screen's lower left corner and to get the yellow lady rolling, click the image. The screen of streets will morph and Ms Pac-Man appears along with the bug-eyed ghosts. Ms Pac-Man came out in 1981 after the popularity of Pac-Man, which debuted in 1980. The game is very similar to the original arcade game but has different music and the ghosts have different movement patterns The internet company also rolled out Google Gnome for April 1, the 'perfect' technology for homeowners who want to have a smart yard Ms Pac-Man came out in 1981 after the popularity of Pac-Man, which debuted in 1980.  The games are very similar but Ms Pac-Man has different music and the colorful ghosts have different movement patterns.  The arcade game wasn't the only trick Google had rolled up its sleeve. The internet company unveiled Google Gnome for April Fools' Day, the 'perfect' technology for homeowners who want to have a smart yard. The Gnome takes over where the Google Home can't, informing its owners of the weather while they are already outside, what type of plants they can eat and reminding humans that everyone will eventually be turned into compost.      Read more: Google Maps morphs into Ms. Pac-Man for April Fools¿ Day - The Verge Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Most watched News videos Live boa constrictor studded with quills after porcupine attack CCTV captures milkman killing tuk-tuk driver with a BRICK Most adorable kitties get treats when they ring their bells Tourists abuse hotel staff after kids get trapped in lift Jaw-dropping moment a great white shark catches a seal 'Boxing champion' driver threatens dad on dual carriageway Maid hangs from window before dramatically falling seven floors Oddly satisfying deep cleaning of a very dirty car seat Entrepreneur flies impressive Iron Man-like flight suit Gran starts heated debate with anti-Brexit campaigners Trump exits oval office without signing executive orders on trade Dashcam of Police chasing after suspected Stourbridge stabber Latest WikiLeaks release shows how the CIA uses computer...

It has launched an April Fools' Day version of Google Maps on Saturday (April 1) that allows users to play the classic arcade game of Ms Pac-Man on "real" streets. Launch the Google Maps app and you will see the pink Ms Pac-Man on the right side of the screen. Tap on it and you will be “transported” to a random location and must guide the yellow Pac-Man around the roads, eating up dots while avoiding colourful ghosts. Keep in mind: You only get five "lives" to outrun the ghosts. The last time Google turned its app into a game of Pac-Man for April Fools' Day was in 2015. In 2014, Google also introduced a version of Google Maps that allowed users to catch Pokemon on the app. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Singapore READ COMMENTED “Good progress” made in containing oil spillage after recent collisions “Bedding-in” period of several months to be expected for DTL2: Khaw ‘Zero tolerance’ for religious preaching that fans violence: Shanmugam ‘You have made Singapore very proud today’: PM Lee to Yip Pin Xiu ‘Wrecked dorm’ videos an isolated incident: SCDF ‘Smart’ law firms lauded for adopting tech solutions ‘More could have been done’ to inform commuters of test ‘Foul play’ in case of man who died after two punches in face Zika re-emerges: First thing new patient did was to inform pregnant neighbour Woodlands Checkpoint to be expanded Woman being investigated for lying to the police What you need to know as S'pore sees first active Zika cluster of 2017 What world needs is regulated globalisation: Hollande Wet and warm days ahead in April Water price hike ‘absolutely necessary’ but should been explained better: PM Lee Inside Today World Venezuelan authorities urge Supreme Court to review decision Venezuelan authorities try to defuse court row 'coup', urge review Myanmar goes to polls for by-elections, in first vote since Suu Kyi swept to power Paraguay rioters set fire to Congress after Senate re-election vote Australia bolsters security checks for flights from Middle East Business Apple, Amazon, Google join bidding for Toshiba chip unit: media Caterpillar shuts plant in Aurora, Illinois, that employs 800 Beyond jobs, car sales to give insight on consumer health BlackBerry's profit beats expectations on software push Global stocks dip as investors take profits after strong quarter Sports FAS set for revamp, if Team LKT wins The time has arrived to stand up and be counted It’s going to be very different, vows Lim Kia Tong The Big Read: For at-risk and underprivileged youth, sports has a special kind of magic Football, a goal for life Entertainment SAM to close for S$90m revamp Coldplay live up to the hype NAC ups arts funding, but some groups see cuts Finn Jones keeps mum on Iron Fist controversies Last chance to get into Sing!

The Galaxy S8 features a larger display than its predecessor, the Galaxy S7, and sports a voice assistant intended to rival Siri and Google Assistant. But there is no increase in battery capacity, providing the battery more breathing room. The Note 7 pushed the engineering envelope with its battery, which contributed to a series of spontaneous smart phone combustions. The Samsung Galaxy S8, right, and S8 Plus models have screens that curve around the edges and sport a voice assistant intended to rival Siri and Google Assistant. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The Galaxy S8 will come in two sizes, both bigger than last year’s models. Both models have screens that curve around the edges and get rid of the physical home button. The Note 7 recall cost Samsung at least $5.3 billion. Though many customers remain loyal, any further misstep could prove fatal for the brand. “We’re in the process of earning back that trust,” said Drew Blackard, a senior director of product marketing for Samsung. In the United States, Samsung started taking orders Thursday, with shipments scheduled for April 21. The standard-size S8 will cost about $750 and the larger S8 Plus about $850 — both about $100 more than comparable iPhones and rival Android phones. Samsung has blamed the Note 7 fires on multiple design and manufacturing defects in its batteries. Inspectors concluded that the initial batteries were too small for their capacity, and that their external pouch put pressure on the internal structure, leading to damage and overheating. Samsung recalled the phones and shipped replacements, but the newer batteries had welding defects and a lack of protective tape in some battery cells. Samsung recalled the replacements, too, and scrapped the phone. The company says phones will now go through multiple inspections, including X-rays and stress tests at extreme temperatures. The standard-size S8 phone has as much battery capacity as last year’s Galaxy S7, but the phone is 4 percent larger by volume. The larger S8 Plus model has 3 percent less capacity than the Galaxy S7 Edge and the same capacity as the Note 7, but the phone’s volume is larger by 12 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Both models have larger displays, meaning more drain on the battery. Samsung says software and processor efficiencies will let the new phones offer all-day battery life under normal use. The S8 phone’s display measures 5.8 inches diagonally, compared with 5.1 inches on the S7. The S8 Plus will be 6.2 inches, compared with S7 Edge’s 5.5 inches and the Note 7’s 5.7 inches. Both S8 models are taller than their predecessors, but widths are roughly the same to preserve one-handed use. Samsung claims its new voice assistant, Bixby, will do much more than rivals from Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. For one thing, Samsung says Bixby will be able to handle any smart phone task now managed by touch. Bixby also will offer information on books, wine and other products scanned with the phone’s camera. But there’s a major caveat: Bixby will work only with selected Samsung apps, including the photo gallery and messages. Not all touch commands will have voice counterparts right away. Other apps will be able to adopt Bixby, but Samsung has had a mixed track record in getting other companies to support its home-brewed functions. The front camera is getting a boost to 8 megapixels, from 5 megapixels, while the rear one stays at 12 megapixels. As with previous models, the S8 is water and dust resistant and features a memory card slot to supplement 64 gigabytes of built-in storage. The S8 will get an iris scanner to let people unlock the phone by looking at it; the feature was new in the ditched Note 7 phone. Samsung will include premium earbuds from AKG, a brand it acquired when it bought Harman International.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Accessories Our favorite smart lock just became the first ever to work with Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant Maren Estrada March 28th, 2017 at 12:00 PM Share Tweet There’s precious little question that the August Smart Lock is one of the best-looking intelligent door locking systems out there. It’s also one of the most feature-rich smart locks on the market, which is why we’ve repeatedly called it our favorite. Now, August has just issued a big update that adds yet another notch to its belt: the company’s lock can already be controlled with Amazon Alexa or with Apple’s Siri voice assistant, and now August has added support for Google Assistant. “As the first company to support all three major voice control platforms, we are giving our customers the ultimate flexibility to choose their preferred platform and device to integrate with the August Smart Lock,” August CEO Jason Johnson said. Initially, users will be able to lock August with Google Assistant, and they can check the status of their lock as well. In the future, the company also plans to add the ability to unlock an August lock with Google Assistant. Some notes from the press release: With the Google Assistant on Google Home, you can lock the door or check if the door is locked by saying, “Ok Google, ask August if my door is locked” or “Ok Google, talk to August to lock my door.” August is working with the Google team to add additional features such as unlocking that will be available later this year. Using the August Smart Lock with Google Assistant-enabled devices also requires the August Connect Wi-Fi bridge to connect the Bluetooth lock to Wi-Fi. And now, for the best news of all: the latest version of the August Smart Lock is currently discounted on Amazon. While Google Assistant support is being added to both the first and second-generation August Smart Locks, now is the perfect time to upgrade thanks to Amazon’s current $50 discount. Some notes from the product page: No more keys: Open your door and control who comes in – all from your August Home smartphone app Easy install: Attach to the inside of your current deadbolt in minutes. Your home’s exterior is unchanged. Hands-free access: Auto-unlock when you arrive home. Auto-locks after you’re inside. Feel secure: Share temporary virtual keys with guests & monitor access with 24/7 in-app activity feed. Remote access: Control your front door from anywhere from your app. Requires August Connect. Works with: Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Nest, IFTTT, Wink, Logitech Harmony, Logitech POP, iOS and Android devices [and now, Google Assistant!] August Smart Lock (2nd Gen) - Keyless home access - Control with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or… $179.99 Available from Amazon BGR may receive a commission Buy Now Follow @BGRDeals on Twitter to keep up with the latest and greatest deals we find around the web.

To help you stay ahead of the game, we've selected the delicious (and not-so-delicious) fake stuff and put it all in the one place. Turns out, a fair few local companies are adept leg-pullers, so you'll see a mix of international and Australian gags below. Now, let's get started... Lubricate Your Facial Hair With James Squire Image: James Squire Everyone knows how hard it is to keep that hipster beard in check, so why not try a bit of James Squire's "Brewer Dry Hopped Beard Oil" to tame that mane. As the company's Facebook page explains, the oil "has been carefully dry hopped using Simcoe and Citra late in the emulsification process by a heavily bearded and tattooed brewer, so you know it's good". We'll, uh, take your word for it. Unlock Your PC With Stack Overflow's Funky Junky Programmers are good for a laugh, as long as you don't interrupt them while they're in the coding zone. Or, as it happens, trying to log into their computer using Stack Overflow's fancy new security system "Dance Dance Authentication". No matter if you're into tango, waltz or break, you can craft your own, customised moves to lock others out of your accounts. Might get tiring if you're in IT support though. Google Pacs It Up Image: Google Google has used its maps service as a proving ground for April Fools' jokes since the beginning of time (well, electronic cartography anyway). Just hit up Google Maps, click the "Insert coin" button at the bottom-left and the roads and laneways of whatever town or city you happen to be looking at will be transformed into a game of Ms. Pac-Man, complete with ghosts, pills and cherries. Google Gnome Questions Your Existence Retro gaming isn't the only gag Google has running today. Meet the Google Gnome, the outdoor companion to the Google Home. It comes complete with weather forecasting, water hose control and a troubling love of all things Nietzsche. If you're keen to ponder the meaning of life while sorting the compost, the Gnome is the talking automation gadget for you. USB-Powered Gaming, Courtesy Of NVIDIA Image: NVIDIA 3D graphics vendor NVIDIA has concocted the world's cutest dongle — if you think tiny video cards are adorable. Plug this sucker, called the "GeForce GTX G-Assist" into your PC and it'll do anything and everything, from playing games while you're AFK, boosting your stats to defeat difficult enemies and it'll even "purchase gifts for your significant other" with its "NVIDIA Nurture" feature. Yellow Octopus' Danger Ranger: GPS And DNA, Together At Last Image: Yellow Octopus Australia is the world's deadliest continent, according to anyone who hasn't visited the country. That's if we even exist! Existential crises aside, we do have a few nasty creepy-crawlies one would prefer not to meet beside the campfire, so why not just avoid them with Yellow Octopus' "Danger Ranger". A "Dangerous Wildlife GPS Scanner", the Ranger is essentially a Star Trek-style tricorder packed with "67 DNA profiles of dangerous creatures". With its "quad helix" antenna and 16-hour battery life, you'll never have to worry about getting unintentionally romantic with a king cobra again! Which is a tricky thing to do in the first place, considering they're not native to Australia. Pets Are People Too, Says Amazon Why should humans get all the home automation fun? What if your dog wants to order snacks online? It's Amazon to the rescue with "Petlexa", the Alexa substitute that caters to the needs of your furry (or scaled) friends. I'm sure it works great, until your Labrador buries it in the backyard (or worse). The Melbourne International Comedy Festival's Manufactured Gags Robots will eventually take all our jobs, including those in creative fields. And that transition starts today. Comedy is under assault, with the first cybernetic grenade being tossed by the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. This year's event will feature the "world's first" AI comedian called LOL-BOT. Despite the fact such an invention would likely go against the MICF's best interests, it's pretty keen on the metallic joke-slinger, which uses facial recognition software and "stochastic modelling" to come up with its material. I'm guessing it also has a backup mode where it relies on Rodney Dangerfield's stuff if the crowd's a bit on the chilly side. Unlocking The Secrets Of Oat Power With Uncle Tobys Image: Uncle Tobys Looks like Allure Media's own Mark Serrels will never have to eat a spoonful of oats ever again, thanks to Uncle Tobys' "O Energy" batteries. By harnessing "the natural oat energy source" that "creates a thick oat puree which generates a superior reaction", the batteries promise clean, renewable energy for all your appliances and if you're brave enough, your stomach too. OK, so they're probably not edible, but that has more to do with the fact that they don't exist. OnePlus Enters The Energy Drink Business Image: OnePlus OnePlus has Dash Charge for its phones, but what if it could distil this technology into some sort of energy drink so one could "Dash Charge" their life? Well, taking a page from Uncle Tobys above, the smartphone company has managed this impossible feat! With customer quotes such as... "Back in my day, you were expected to get married, buy a house, and sleep for 8 hours each night. Now I see sleep was a lie created to sell sleep aids and special mattresses. Thank you, Dash. You have changed a life." ...how could you resist this specially-formulated miracle tonic? There's even a bizarre ad to go with it! Ford Australia's 'Active Thanks Assist' Tech Image: Ford Australia Apparently, being able to express emotions via your car's rear window can have a positive impact on the temperament of drivers around you, especially if you have the wheel skills of a burrito-wielding Ron Burgundy. It's surprising that it's taken this long for a car manufacturer to offer this built-in, with Ford Australia first off the rank with its "Active Thanks Assist" technology. There's also "Active Sorry Assist" for when you cut someone off, but no "Active Middle Finger Assist" when it goes the other way. Still working on that one, I suppose. National Geographic Offers Animals A Thread Of Hope Image: Harryy Whittier Frees, Library of Congress It's about time animal photographers treated their subjects with dignity. All these "natural" shots are utterly uncouth in 2017. As such, National Geographic has declared it will no longer publish "nude animal pictures". Instead, enjoy this super-cute clothed still from a simpler era, more of which can be found at Neo Geo. Netflix Live, Making The Ordinary... More Ordinary With nothing but a gravely-voiced Will Arnett and the tagline "Toasters toasting. Grass growing. Fans blowing. With Netflix Live, you can experience life's biggest thrills, right from the comfort of your couch", Netflix gave us a sneak peek at... nothing, actually. If you want to see Netflix Live, you'll have to watch it, well, live. Other than a couple of poor-quality smartphone recordings on YouTube, those without Netflix subscriptions will remain in the dark. Though I guess that's the point. The gist? Arnett narrates everyday life. eHarmony Australia Combines Physics With The Physical Image: eHarmony Good looks and charming personality not enough? eHarmony Australia has decided to take a literal approach to the attraction game by adding "magnetism" to its dating apps. The app will turn your phone into "an incredibly strong magnet" making you difficult, if not impossible, to resist. Perfect for all those single robots out there. I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream With Contiki Australia I'm starting to notice a trend with these April Fools' pranks — the elimination of humans in customer service roles. Ignoring the somewhat disturbing subtext, Contiki Australia will soon provide tours personally tailored by "Artificial Intelligence Trip Managers", or ATITA. According to Contiki, ATITA can adjust its personality to "suit each traveller" using its "data mining capabilities" to know "everything about you". I've always wanted to be stalked by my tour guide for that authentic "horror film" holiday. Now, I finally can. ING DIRECT Debuts My First Forgery Image: ING Using its patented counterfeiting technology, ING has come up with the "iTM", a phone with a built-in 3D printer than can produce "cash notes on demand". The iTM promises to eliminate "the need to use traditional ATMs" while at the same time giving your derriere a first-class ticket to the gloved hand of a federal police officer. According to ING, it's also compatible with the likes of Android Pay and Apple Pay. Committing overt felonies has never been easier! Moshi, Breaking Universal Constants Moshi is upping its accessory game by going superluminal. Forget USB Hi-Speed or SuperSpeed — why not try Moshi's Speed of Light? Going by the promotional video, USB-SL can solve every single computer problem. Heck, it can even make your notebook battery charge higher than 100 per cent. Magic? Science? Or a combination of both? Only Moshi's techno-sorcerers know the secret. Sausage Refunds For All, Thanks To ME Bank The boffins at ME Bank have been hard at work on SmellWave technology. Its first application? Cashback on all your sausage purchases. All you have to do is tap ME's Snag debit card on your barbecued meat tube and $2.50 will be deposited into your account. With careful use, you could eat free forever, if you don't mind a tiny, tiny case of atherosclerosis. Old School, Yoyo Fun With Virgin Mobile Image: Virgin Mobile We have lanyards for our glasses to stop them wandering into open toilets and other nefarious places. Can't phones have a similar convenience? While the science behind anti-gravity remains elusive, Virgin Mobile have gone with a simpler solution — the "Pho Yo". No, this isn't a clash of smartphone tech and Vietnamese cuisine, rather a the combo of yoyo and phone. Not only do you assure the safety of your mobile, but you can twirl it around while you wait for the bus. Is it a good idea? That depends on how much disposable income you have. Taste The Bicarbonate With RedBalloon Image: RedBalloon If you're always up for exciting and unique experiences, RedBalloon has some choice selections available starting from today. Bore your palate with the company's exclusive "Water Tasting Masterclass" or if you're chasing rare Pokemon, check out the Pokemon Day Tour. My personal favourite however is the Naked Paintball, if only for the gag-filled product page, which includes such witticisms as "unlimited balls" under the supplies section. Above and below body armour is also provided, which while necessary, would mostly cancel out the naked part. Deliveroo / Huxtaburger, Your Beach Burger Specialists Push bikes and motorcycles can only go so quickly, so food delivery service Deliveroo, with some help from Huxtaburger, has branched out... or should that be branched up? If you're keen from some grub and can't wait 30 minutes, Deliveroo will go to extreme lengths to get your order to you, even if it involves the expense of a parachute and plane rental. My only question: How does the poor delivery guy get back to the restaurant-post airdrop? Someone certainly isn't skipping leg day. Houzz, Blowing Up Unsightly Couches Since 2017 eBay and Gumtree? Why bother selling your old stuff when you can just blow it up? Home improvement site Houzz has supplemented its mobile app with augmented reality munitions, allowing one to simply explode unwanted furniture and unsightly trinkets. All you have to do fire up the "Hide From My Room" tool, crop the subject and tap. Try to avoid targeting your neighbour's annoying dog... or kids. Definitely keep it away from kids. The Great Reddit Experiment Image: Supplied The folks behind Reddit decided to harness the site's massive audience for a creative social experiment. If you hit up /r/place you'll find a scrollable canvas where users can place a single coloured block once every 10 minutes. It appears the delay was shorter at some point, allowing users to craft coherent images. For example, part of the image includes a picture of Wally, of Where's Wally fame. Unfortunately, in typical internet style, Wally now has his own, uh, little Wally. Cool? Move Over Glad Wrap, Try Primo Smallgoods' Bacon Wrap Image: Primo Smallgoods Bacon is the perfect complement to any meal. Sandwiches, pasta, salads, ice-cream — if you can eat it, you can eat it wrapped / sprayed / infused with bacon. Primo Smallgoods has the ideal product to make adding bacon to your diet easier, taking a page from Glad with its Bacon Wrap. Sure, it's terrible for protecting your food and will actually attract pests to your picnic, but doesn't it look scrumptious? Samurai Punk Announces Screencheat 2... For the N-Gage Image: Samurai Punk Aussie developer Samurai Punk made a name for itself with Screencheat, a split-screen competitive shooter where your opponents are invisible, forcing you to peek at other players' screens in order to win. Well, the studio has announced a sequel, exclusive to Nokia's N-Gage phone / handheld console. No idea what the N-Gage is? Best to change "is" to "was"; the gadget died a fast, horrible death many years ago. GrabOne NZ Providing Discounts On One Tree Hill's Zipline Image: GrabOne NZ Here's one for our New Zealand readers. Group deal site GrabOne NZ is offering discounted rides on the newly erected One Tree Hill zipline. According to the deal, One Tree Hill "has stood idle for too long" and thanks to AJ Hackett Bungy, are giving users the "once in a lifetime opportunity to zip over Cornwall Park as you laugh in glee at the slow-moving joggers and dog walkers below". I get the impression some interested parties thought this was an actual thing, given the massive April Fools' warning. Obviously, clicking the "Buy" button immediately takes you to a page revealing the joke. Travel Insurance Direct, Helping You Avoid Bad Tattoo Decisions Image: Travel Insurance Direct You've almost certainly heard (or sadly experienced) a tattoo horror story where that foreign-language inscription doesn't mean what its owner thinks it means. Travel Insurance Direct has you covered with its Tattoo Spell Checker app, which is great and all, except you'll want to use it before the fact, not after as illustrated in the promo picture. If you don't want to bother with the app, Google Translate should do the job just as well. Smell Like A Rabbit With Ubisoft's New Odour Image: Ubisoft Game publisher Ubisoft is getting in on the April Fools' action with its fictional scent "Viril". Anyone familiar with the company's Raving Rabbids franchise will recognise the telltale ears on the top of the bottle. Described as "a perfume for the real manly man", Viril is a "ground-breaking" eau de toilette, made by smelling "countless rabbits". Fair enough, but it's no Sex Panther. Travelodge Dreams Of Bacon Image: Travelodge And we're back to the bacon gags! Travelodge has a new "anti-snooze service" it's cooked up, called "Rise & Sizzle!", where a professional chef will break into your room with a smoking pan of freshly-fried bacon and waft it under your nose. For everyone who can't afford this personal touch, you'll have to make do with bacon-emitting alarms, courtesy of Sensorwake. Actually, Sensorwake's olfactory alarms are a real thing, though they don't appear to provide bacon as an option. Chocolate, toast and espressos yes, charred ham, no. Drop The Bass On Your Foot With Master & Dynamic Image: Master & Dynamic Your current headphones heavy on the bass? How about just heavy? Screw all those new-age materials, let's get back to basics — like, building basics — with Master & Dynamic's MH40C1 cups made entirely from concrete. Weighing 4.81kg, they're the epitome of comfort, but only if you're the bulkiest member of the Fantastic Four. Can't say how successfully they'll be with non-superheroes, but you have to experiment. As M&D CEO Jonathan Levine explains: "Master & Dynamic has consistently chosen the road less travelled. As of today, that road is paved with concrete." Originally published on Lifehacker Australia. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments skrybe @skrybe Apr 1, 2017, 4:10pm I'd actually like to see that Active Thanks Assist as a real thing. But it needs the middle finger option too :) I kinda expected a Blizzard one (or several) but nothing there. Unless you count the horrible adobe flash splash screens at the blizzard site.

By Courtney Linder / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Through her alter-ego, “The Lady Carpenter,” Tenika Chavis earns her living as a residential and commercial contractor, renovating anything from stairs to kitchen cabinets and filling custom carpentry orders for her clientele in the Hill District. Ms. Chavis owns a one-woman general contracting company, TDC Contracting LLC, which pops up neatly on the right-hand side of a Google search result, where businesses are listed. But like countless other local businesses, the search query returns few details — no photos, no website and no address. Google is seeking to end this dearth of information through a nationwide initiative, “Get Your Business Online,” which helps small businesses enhance their presence on Google search, Google Maps and Google+. On Friday morning, at least 60 Pittsburgh-area business owners attended a free workshop on the subject at Ace Hotel in East Liberty. Nationally, 55 percent of small businesses do not have a website, according to an October 2013 study conducted by Google and research company Ipsos. Michael Capsambelis, senior product manager for the Mountain View, Calif.-based search engine giant with an office in Pittsburgh’s East End, said this figure is even lower in Pennsylvania, where less than 50 percent of small businesses have a website.  This phenomenon is “shocking,” Mr. Capsambelis said, noting that despite how swamped a business may be, it is paramount to get online. Eighty percent of consumers use a search engine to look for information on a local business, he said. Plus, businesses that are online grow 40 percent faster than those that are not, he added, citing data from a 2012 Boston Consulting Group report, “The Connected World: The Internet Economy in the G-20.” Stasia Kudrez, a facilitator for Google, led the two-hour workshop. She explained how business owners can verify their Google business listing at www.gybo.com. It’s critical to edit the information there, add photos and respond to reviews, she said. Congressman Mike Doyle attended the workshop, lauding small businesses as the “engine of our economy,” and encouraging them to use Google’s free tools. Louise Silk of Silk Denim, a family business in the South Side Flats which upcycles jeans into denim apparel and accessories, said she already has a website, but hoped to expand her audience. “I’ve been wanting to update my site for a while, and this motivated me to do it,” she said. “Our customers come from around the country, so we have a really web-based operation.” Ms. Kudrez said potential customers — who may be trying to reach the likes of TDC Contracting LLC or Silk Denim — conduct 40,000 searches per second on Google. “If even the smallest percentage of those searches are for you, you want to show up,” she said. “Start thinking about critical moments when customers grab their device and look for help.” Courtney Linder: clinder@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1707.

Welcome to Fast Forward, where we have conversations about living in the future. At SXSW this year, we talked with Sophie Kleber, Executive Director of Product and Innovation at the Huge Digital Agency. In the interview below, we discuss conversational interfaces, making smarter machines, and the bot revolution, among other things. Watch our chat or read the transcript below. Dan Costa: You gave a presentation about how we can make more emotional machines. What exactly does that mean, and why do we want to have more emotional machines? I was asked this question in my talk. When I proposed emotionally intelligent man-computer or machine-computer interactions, people were like, "We don't even have emotionally intelligent humans, so is it like the blind leading the blinder?" The thing is, we're currently at a super cusp between how we interact with machines. The time of what we call "the terminal world"—where we interact through terminals made smaller and smaller, but it's really just screens—that time is over. The interactions that we now have are becoming much more intuitive. Voice is the leading chart of it, but even the Internet of Things, in which computing power wraps your life and does things without you, even small adjustments without you consciously thinking about it, it's a very, very new world of interacting with machines. The intelligence that's starting to come up as well is fascinating. What we've noticed in research that we've done with people who have conversed with Alexa or Google is that the moment that machine starts talking, people assume relationships. It is not that these people say, "Oh, it's now just easier." They also assume that the machine has some sort of empathy towards them, some sort of support. The moment to think about what that means and what that personality is, is now. Then there's this other fear that's coming. It has been coming since 1995, when it was invented at MIT by Rosalyn Picard is the idea of effective computing. That means that machines are able to understand, interpret, and decode emotions and also potentially to react emotionally. There's these two sides to it, right? Yes. It's very, very important that we talk about it now because this the first step into mind reading. By 2021, this is expected to be a $36.4 billion dollar industry, so it's a massive industry of just detecting emotions. If you see what these machines can detect, there's basically three messages. There's facial recognition, voice, and biometrics. Facial is the most advanced because of these micro-movements that we have and micro-expressions that we have. If you see what can be done, it's a little bit like mind reading. It's a massive opportunity and a massive responsibility. Someone I talked to at MIT said it's like nuclear power. Now we have to see what we do with it. That's why we're talking about it now, because the moment is here. The intelligence is coming, the interaction models are changing, so we need to figure it out. People are ready for it, or assume it naturally, so we need to figure out what we do as industry and how we get into it. I think that phrase "terminal-based computing" is interesting. PCMag obviously covered the birth of the PC industry. We moved into the mobile space, but that was basically just a terminal that you could carry with you wherever you went. Now that we've got Siri and Google Now, those were okay interfaces, but with the rise of Alexa and Google Home you find people at home asking questions and getting into conversations. They literally presume that there's some kind of emotional response. They read into it. That's right. That's because as humans we were built to look for those types of responses. I have thought a lot about why Siri wasn't a success and Alexa is a success. I think there's two parts to it. The first one is that Siri was built as an alternative interface to an interface that was already there. Siri's on the phone, there's already an interface, why would I switch it to the voice, right? Because the voice interface was worse than the screen-based interface, it didn't kick off. Alexa doesn't have a screen interface. It's just a puck. It has only the voice interface. Plus Alexa's in the comfort of your home in which you have a much different understanding of privacy. It's yours. You are much more comfortable just talking out loud to a machine versus in public, [where] I'm not going to go ask Siri weird, embarrassing questions. I'm amazed at how many people do that, though. Complete voice dictation on a crowded train. Yeah, it's starting to become a little bit weird because these people forget that they're not in a private space. They don't understand what everyone else can hear. We see how that goes. The assumption of emotions was pretty big. In our user research, we found everything from wanting a basic assistant, just doing the chores and reminding you of stuff to this one guy said, "What if I could come home and I can unload onto my AI? I could just unload what happened in the day and the machine is like, 'Oh yeah, that's great.'" He wanted it to listen. Yes. He literally used the phrase "instead of paying the shrink." Then we asked people in an ideal world, what would you describe the relationship between the machine? They said anything from assistant, to friendly assistant, to friend, to best friend, even mom. Two people had named their AIs and one had named it after their mom and the other one had named it after their child. These are very, very personal relationships, so it's already there. I think when we think about what brands have to, and could do, the first thing we need to think about is what are we trying to achieve here? Are we trying to make Prozac in computer form? I think, luckily, the research in happiness has evolved enough to understand that that happiness is not the goal. People want a fulfilled life, to flourish. A way to flourish is not just being happy. It has to do with meaning. It has to do with meaningful relationships and accomplishment. This concept of resilience says you need to be down in order to get back up and feel like you have accomplished something. Emotions are complicated as f**k. Happiness is complicated. Everything is something that we have to be very nuanced in what we want to achieve. If we assume for a second we want to achieve flourishing, right? Then we have to see okay, what kind of inputs do we have? Then what kind of ways do we have to react? There's two parts. I develop a framework essentially and there's two parts to the framework. The first one is permission to play and desire for emotion. From a user perspective, you have to understand whether in this particular situation there's a desire for emotion. You look at what's the user's emotional state right now? Are they in an okay emotional state? What are their emotional ambitions? Do they want to go somewhere else from that state? What is the nature of the interaction? Is it a transaction? Like if I'm just transacting on American Airlines or whatever there's no way for me to infuse emotions because it isn't in any way an interaction that wires and requires that. I think a lot of brands make a mistake right at that point. They're in a situation where it should be transactional and instead they're trying to have a conversation with their user and the user doesn't want to have a conversation. The last 20 years perfected the internet as a transactional machine. If you look at all the companies that rose to power—Amazon, Google, all these travel sites—these are all transaction-based situations. We've perfected that, so we shouldn't mess with that. In that framework then, you have to see whether or not there's actually a desire for emotional interaction. Then you have to look at what the user's context is like. If we're sitting here and we're having a connection an AI would come in and say, "Oh, you seem stressed. Calm down." It's not going to go over well. It's not the right moment in time. Exactly. Then on the brand side you have to think about a lot of things as well. I think it was in 2014 Facebook actually conducted an experiment. A very controversial experiment. A very controversial experiment. They wanted to understand whether if you look at positive things in your News Feed you get happier and vice versa. If you look at negative things you get sadder, right? They conducted this experiment where they showed thousands and thousands of people neutral to positive messages and vice versa, neutral to negative messages. Then measured the sentiment in their posts, to find out whether they were happier or sadder. Low and behold, of course, they were. If you saw more negative messages you would tend to post something more negative as well. Problem was they did that completely without humans agreeing to it. They did it completely without permission. They kind of fall back to their terms and conditions and said this is fine, but ... Because they're engineers. They're engineers. They were just engineers beta testing. They were just A/B testing a theory. Exactly. They collected data and it was useful data. It was useful data, but this is the danger zone. If you look at it from the other side, in 2014 Facebook intentionally made thousands and thousands of people sad. That is ethically not correct. We are currently teetering on this edge where a couple of companies are playing with it. We see companies going to market that say "we can measure your stress level and now we're just going to apply self-optimization, gamification to it and say you have a streak of being less stressed." No one knows whether this is desired, so we've got to be very careful. You can't design what you can't understand. Cognitive interaction and especially emotions is something that we're only scratching the surface of. Every designer has to be very, very careful not to design something that we can't really understand. That by the way also prevents us from ever designing or in the near future designing Ex Machina, right? Of course. We can't design a machine yet that has ambitions when we don't really understand how ambitions are formed. We can't really understand an emotional crazy manipulator, when we don't understand how emotions work and why they work with one person and not with the other. Then of course there's the laws of robotics that apply as well, which the first law being don't harm a human being or neglect, allow a human being to be harmed. I'm not worried about the Ex Machina thing. I'm more worried about the lack of knowledge and therefore cheap tricks, like when you think about the Hershey Smile Machine where you're going up and if you smile you get a free Hershey's. There is something Pavlovian about that, more than anything else. Exactly. We're not Pavlovian dogs and I'm guaranteeing you this is not a genuine smile. The smile only turns genuine once you have the chocolate. We're turning things around in a weird way because we're playing, we're trying to figure it out. I think you're right about the Hershey experiment, but there is technology that can tell whether or not that smile is genuine or not. Right. The question is who's going to be allowed to get that information? Obviously for the user, it would be great. That could be positive feedback. It could help you run your life better, but should your employer have access to that information? Should brands have access to that information? Then what are the rules about what they can do with that information? Because right now there are basically no rules. If you look at the permission to play, that framework, is it the right context? Do you have active permission from the user? I think at this point there needs to be an active agreement that needs to be made, so I can't just go and scan you from afar and say, "This person is happy or this person is sad," or monitor you in terms of employment. Of course it's tricky because that environment is an owned environment and you enter, you actively agree into that owned environment when you sign up for a job somewhere. They read your emails, or they could potentially, you agree to that. Then what is the purpose again of that understanding? Is the purpose to change your emotions for emotional well-being or is the purpose productivity, which are not the same thing. Employers sometimes try to make them the same thing because it would be beautiful if they could, but they aren't. I think in that framework the other thing is, does the company actually have a value proposition that allows them to play in that space? Because we are just at the cusp of research, a lot of the work that's being done is being done in some sort of well-being, like stress, weight loss, with people who have difficulty decoding emotions. It's very much a well-being, a health kind of space situation, but it's not going to stay there. What's your value proposition that you can play there and then do you actually have the right intelligence? Do you actually know and have the right algorithms to decode what you're seeing? Then understanding of what comes out of it. When you look at that framework, you fill it with basically three different ways that a machine can interact. The first one is it reacts like a machine. It understands the emotional input, but it outputs like a machine. Conversational IVRs do that, right? They route you. They understand your stress level, but they route you or expedite you to a human being so it's like a switchboard much more than anything. Or safety in cars, the car understands that you're dozing off or that you get angry. They react like a machine by either pulling over or stopping the machine. They can read the emotion, they can acknowledge it, but then they react like a machine instead of reacting like a human. Exactly. That's the first option. The second option is this idea of the machine reacting like an extension of self. There's two parts to it. The one is to make the emotions visible for the user so it's a learning experience, telling you your stress level is high. Telling you your anger level is high, or things like that. [It's a] little bit [like] Big Hero 6...diagnostics. It's this idea of just kind of exposing it, but the user is in full control of changing the emotions or acting in any way shape or form. This is the space that we are very comfortable in right now, but the space moves very easily into a space of empathy. The question arises, would we ever be willing to pay for a service like that with the premise that this service is uniquely here for us? The service doesn't take ads like Apple. It isn't doing ads and things like that, and therefore we pay for it to be uniquely for us. Then the last one is the idea of reacting like a human. That is the idea that I as a user enter an agreement with the machine allowing that machine to manipulate my emotion still based or with the premise of my well-being, but I actively enter into the agreement that this machine can manipulate my emotions. You give it some independence. You give it some independence and you give it some permission to give you advice. And to steer you. To steer you, yes. That Facebook experiment was very instructive. They figured out what makes people sad, what makes people happy. I can imagine people saying, "Well, I'll pay an extra $5 a month for a Facebook feed that makes me happy." Right. It makes me "happier," I should say. It makes me happier, exactly. I didn't know this, but in the research I found when you ask Alexa or tell Alexa, "Alexa, I'm really sad," she actually reacts like a scene from Big Hero 6. She's like, "I'm sorry you feel that way. Sometimes listening to music or taking a walk or calling friends or talking to friends helps. I hope you feel better soon." She's not qualified. This is like Google 101 research. I found this on the internet, but people are already thinking about it, engineers are thinking about it right now. It's not cognitive psychology. It's not designers. It's not even marketers, but it's engineers are thinking about these kinds of things. It comes very close and the idea that a machine that you could very soon ask a machine for this type of advice is here. It's not tomorrow. This is right now. Are there any brands or companies that are doing this well? That are providing a service that can do one of these things well? There are a couple of companies. Because we currently really just moving from research into commercial applications, there are a few companies who do interesting things in these spaces. AutoEmotive is a company that does it in the driving space, in the auto space to say okay, we're going to detect all of these things, but when you look at it it's still a little bit like a wire, it looks like a physical computing experiment a little bit.They're pretty well-funded as a start-up. Affectiva, of course, does a lot of it in the commercial space by showing people ads and having people reading the micro-expressions. It's market research, but it's important and interesting. There's one company, it's called SimSensei, and it looks a little bit like talking to a SIM, but the idea is this. In PTSD treatment and things like that, especially young men, soldiers have huge difficulties talking to therapists because of the stigma of the shrink and so forth. They've developed an emotionally reacting or empathetic bot to start these conversations. While they're saying okay, these conversations aren't necessarily the only therapy, they are just an auxiliary to real therapy, this has a huge success with this type of target audience. They feel much more comfortable talking to a machine because they think it's just out and over. It's like the guy in the research who was like, "I talked to my bot and it's done and it's out. It's over." There's a way into something that previously many people didn't have access to or had a stigma around it, where it actually starts being interesting . That's fascinating. Let me get to my closing question. I ask all my guests this. What trend, technological trend are you most concerned about going forward in the future? I do have to say it's the trend of understanding the emotions because, of course, that's why I'm talking about it. You have concerns. You're worried about this. I'm worried about this. Yale University and MIT just recently entered into an agreement to put $27 million dollars aside to think about the ethics of this. When you see some of these detections and see what comes out, it is very intimate and it is very close to mind reading. I don't know your thoughts, but I know your feelings. There's something to that that we have to see how we get comfortable with it. I do, however, think that there's this constant adaption curve between what technology can do and what humans want. It's kind of like playing tennis, right? Something comes out in terms of a technology capability and we're like, "Okay cool." Then at some point we toss the ball back and we're like, "No, not cool. We don't want it." I think a similar thing is going to happen here as well and potentially there's an idea that with the idea of exposing these emotions we become more in tune with them as well. We're talking about mind reading, but even less than mind reading it could be mass manipulation, technological-based manipulation. Right. Which is concerning. It's concerning, and if you look at the balance you know we're talking about $27 million here and then an expected $36 billion on the other side. This is a little bit of chump change to put aside for the ethics of it. I do think that all technological advances make us think and make us adapt as humankind in an extremely lightning speed. I think that this is another piece of that. In terms of positivity, positive trends, what do you see? What trend do you think that gives you great hope and that you're really excited about? I am very excited about the idea of not having to interact with machines as a screen anymore because I do think that where we're going with conversational UIs and additional UIs and non-UIs, like truly non-UIs as well is we are coming back to an idea of why we originally invented machines. That is an idea to for us as humans have more of the thing that we value most, which is time and live the life we want to live. Just now that we are out of this idea of serving a machine because we have to learn their commands, but actually having a machine listen more. We're coming closer to that original promise, so I'm very, very happy to see where that goes. Is there a gadget that you use everyday that you are just in love with, that changed your life? My Philips Hue. Really? Yes. It's so crazy. Yeah, I have it at home only in one room and I love being able to wake up with light versus waking up with an alarm, which is always a horrendous sound. I love changing the moods and things like that and I love the potential that it has as well once it's connected and once it might be able to be connected to my biometrics to just do things by itself. I think lighting is such a fantastic small mood changer and to be able to connect these things. I've heard a lot of people say that. I was very dismissive of intelligent light bulbs because they were very expensive and I didn't see the utility. Once I installed them in my house, I use them every day. Yeah, it's crazy. If people want to follow your work, find out what you're working on, where can they find you online? The best for my work is Twitter. I'm @BIBILASSI. Then of course at Huge Inc., we have a blog where we post on Medium. It's called Magenta. Sometimes when I get a real brain spark I post it there, too.

Media Creation | 29 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (1) Photo Editing as One with Luminar by Jeff Carlson Back when most photographers used Adobe Photoshop to edit their images, many developers created plug-ins or stand-alone applications to focus on specific tasks. For example, Nik Software’s Silver Efex Pro plug-in specialized in creating black-and-white images, as did Macphun’s Tonality application. Whether you wanted more control over removing digital noise or applying lots of pre-made effects, there was a separate tool (often purchased separately or as a bundle) for you. Recently, though, photo editing is shifting back to all-in-one tools. Google purchased Nik Software and has been working its technology into Snapseed and Google Photos (though the Nik tools are still available for free; see “Google Gives Away Its Nik Collection Photo-editing Apps,” 31 March 2016). And Macphun has released a new application, Luminar, that takes the technologies from its solo applications and combines them into one master tool. (Tonality and the other utilities remain for sale separately or bundled as Creative Kit.) Luminar is a bold bet intended to compete against Photoshop — still the biggest gorilla in the jungle for professionals and enthusiasts — while also beckoning those who haven’t yet moved on from Apple’s long-discontinued Aperture. Luminar is also trying to appeal to casual photographers who want more image editing capabilities than Apple’s Photos. Plus, with its $69 price, Luminar hopes to appeal to the folks who don’t want to pay Adobe’s monthly or yearly subscription fee to use Photoshop. Before we get into the details, though, indulge me in one quick declaration about its core capabilities: Luminar is more than capable as an image editor — it has all the adjustment controls for manipulating tone and color that you’d expect. Trying to cover them all in this article would bore us both. In my testing, none of Luminar’s edits were inconsistent with what you’d see when editing in other applications. The tools are all there; it’s what you do with them that makes a difference. If you want to compare features with Aperture, Lightroom, and Creative Kit, Macphun has created a handy chart. What’s most interesting about Luminar is its approach to juggling all of those tools. Like other Macphun applications, Luminar prominently features presets for one-click editing. And for the individual tools, Luminar refers to everything as “filters” that exist in “workspaces.” Other editing applications also use that terminology, but Luminar’s execution sets it apart. First, a disclaimer: In early 2016 I wrote a short guide for Macphun about its Aurora HDR application, which the company still gives away as part of purchasing bundles. I also contract with Adobe to produce tutorials and other educational materials. Presets -- I tend to gloss over or outright ignore presets, probably because of how I learned to edit photos in other applications. I prefer digging into the adjustment controls to nudge a photo’s appearance so it’s closer to what I remember seeing when I captured it, rather than applying a preset that dramatically shifts the look of the image. Some of Luminar’s 60 presets help with the kind of nudging I like. Image Enhancer, for instance, acts as a general make-better button, while Sky Enhancer and Detailed address specific goals or fixes (pulling drama out of bland upper areas and sharpening soft images, respectively). However, it’s increasingly common for photographers to want to apply stylized looks to photos. I often see Instagram photographers who have developed a signature look for all of their shots. The idea isn’t necessarily to reflect what was captured, but instead to evoke a mood, like adding a tinge of earth tones to every shot. Each of Luminar’s preset displays a preview of your image with the effect applied, so you get a sense of how it will affect the photo before you make a choice. Applying a Luminar preset saves a lot of time adjusting the same settings for each image. The app’s six categories of presets — Basic, Street, Outdoor, Portrait, Travel, and Dramatic — are fine starting points, but it’s better to create your own based on your editing preferences. It’s easy to make new presets, share them with other Luminar users, and install presets others have created. Editing with Filters -- One of the things I like about Luminar is that it’s relentlessly non-destructive. When editing photos, you don’t want to actually change the pixels in the original image, something older software did and many of Photoshop’s legacy controls still do. Non-destructive editing not only makes it easy to revert to the original and start over, but also change different aspects of what you’ve edited to that point. For example, if you increase the color temperature and then later increase the saturation, the photo could end up too warm. You can go back and lower the color temperature to balance the warmth while maintaining the saturated colors you want. Luminar enables this flexibility by making nearly every adjustment a filter, from basic controls such as Tone to specialized ones like Adjustable Gradient, which manipulates several types of edits — exposure, contrast, vibrancy, and warmth — in the top and bottom areas of the frame. To use a particular editing effect, add a filter; the interface even explains what each effect does. You can also read more detail about each filter in Macphun’s documentation. This approach isn’t unique; Lightroom has editing panels whose adjustments can be turned on and off, and Photos includes more adjustments than most people realize because they’re not initially visible in the Adjustments panel. Luminar takes the concept further by making almost everything a filter. That leads to some interesting options. You can duplicate each filter, enabling you to stack multiple instances of an effect, or perhaps colorize two instances of the same effect with different hues. Filters can also have their own blend modes, something typically available only to layers. A blend mode applies the filter’s effect to a certain range of colors or tones. For example, the Multiply blend mode removes white from the scene, darkening it dramatically without having to adjust the exposure. One feature I miss is an easy Auto option for calculating the best adjustments to make a photo look good. This isn’t due to laziness on my part (though that’s sometimes true) but is because I’m curious about how the software thinks an image should look. In Lightroom, I often click the Auto button in the Basic adjustments panel to establish a starting point for my editing. Sometimes the software overexposes a shot compared to what I’d prefer. I’ll then adjust the settings to my liking, or choose Edit > Undo and manually start from scratch. The closest workaround in Luminar is to choose a preset such as Image Enhancer and work your way up from there. To the app’s credit, the Tone filter also includes a Smart Tone slider that performs some of these tasks. Perhaps I just need to retrain myself, but I’d find it helpful to have an Auto button on the Tone filter, or on any filter, for that matter. Tools and Layers -- In addition to the filters, Luminar includes a handful of tools that perform specific actions. The Clone & Stamp tool, the Erase tool (which is like Photoshop’s content-aware technology), and the Denoise tool all operate like stand-alone modules, taking over the screen and presenting controls for just those actions. When you finish making the edit, such as removing an object from a scene using the Erase tool, Luminar adds that edit as a new layer — yet another instance of non-destructive respect for the original image. As with layers in other applications, you can use layers in Luminar to build up effects, isolate edits to specific areas, and more. When a new layer is created, by a tool or by manually adding one, all of Luminar’s filters are available to it. For example, suppose you want to brighten just one area of a photo instead of the entire image. One way to do that would be to create a new adjustment layer (which affects the appearance of the layers below it), and add a filter such as Tone or Exposure. Next, you’d use the Radial Mask tool to drag an oval over the area you wish to highlight and click Invert so the adjustment is applying to the area within the circle. You could then add other filters to change the appearance. Luminar supports the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. When using the Clone & Stamp tool, for instance, there’s a handy brush size slider in the Touch Bar, which is far more convenient than taking a mouse trip to the options bar and changing the size there. (You can also press the bracket keys to make the brush size larger or smaller, a faster method and a standard convention among many similar applications, but that’s not obvious to new users.) However, the size slider is not present when using the Brush Mask tool, which would be equally helpful, so it looks as though Touch Bar support isn’t yet complete. Workspaces -- The final piece of Luminar’s editing experience is its Workspaces feature, which takes advantage of the modularity of filters to create collections of filters that you use regularly or in specific situations. Not every photo needs every filter; if you’re working on a black-and-white image, why clutter the interface with Hue and Saturation controls? Luminar offers workspaces for four common photo types, each of which includes filters you’d use for such an image: B & W, Landscape, Portrait, and Street. You can also set up Workspaces for convenience, such as by putting your preferred controls at the top of the Filters panel to reduce unnecessary scrolling. Lightroom Plug-in and Photos Extension -- It’s worth calling out the fact that Luminar does not attempt to manage your photo library. I normally wouldn’t even bring that up, since Luminar is an editing application, but Macphun has said that a future update will add library management, too. If you’re accustomed to managing, opening, and editing photos in Lightroom or Photos, it feels almost archaic to edit image files in another app. In the meantime, Luminar includes a plug-in that lets you use Lightroom’s Edit In command to send a copy of an image to the Luminar application. When you finish, the edited version shows up in your Lightroom library. If you instead use Photos to manage your photo collection, you can take advantage of Luminar’s editing tools using a Photos extension. That loads Luminar inside the Photos interface and offers the same controls you’d find in the stand-alone application. When you save your changes, the extension applies the edits to the image in the Photos library. Note that when you’re using either the Luminar plug-in for Lightroom or the Luminar editing extension in Photos, you can’t go back in and adjust your settings later. Both options create a final edited version of the photo. In Lightroom, the copy sits alongside the original in a stack (Lightroom’s method of grouping photos). In Photos, you can revert to the original and start over if you don’t like the result, or you can edit on top of the edited version. Compare that to opening photos from the Finder and editing them directly in the Luminar application. In that situation, you can save the results as Luminar files that can optionally retain their edit history. You get more editing flexibility, but if you use Lightroom or Photos to manage your photos, you need to track those Luminar files (with an .lmnr filename extension) separately. When Macphun delivers the update that adds image management (which so far isn’t pegged to a date, but is just a promise), you will, in theory, be able to go back and access the entire edit history for any photo in your library. That’s how Lightroom works now if you use its built-in editing tools. All in One and One for All -- For pure convenience, having all the editing tools you want close at hand is better than reaching into every corner of your workshop to get them. Too often, when companies try to build all-in-one tools, the result is either lackluster or overcrowded. Luminar strikes that delicate balance of including most everything you want in a photo editor without being overwhelming. It’s a powerful app that can also be picked up pretty easily by photographers looking for more than Photos offers without committing too (and paying for) the full capabilities of Photoshop.

Hats off for a great review of Luminar that serves your readers well. Your insights into using presets as starting points, plus explaining the flexibility of filters/layers and workspaces were spot on. I also loved the idea of stacking multiple instances of the same filter - good insight that I often forget about! The "Auto button" is a feature I've also recommended and am advocating for w/ the dev team - nice suggestion! One thing I'd add which I think is super-unique and really flexible is the idea of using Filter Masking within a single layer. In other words, any filter you want to apply to an image can be selectively applied with a brush/mask, without creating additional layers. Opens up a world of possibilities! Cheers!

Perhaps you have heard about the mysterious world of AdWords. Or maybe you live under a rock, and neither of these is true. Let’s look at it this way: You need a new project management tool and you’re ready to explore your options. Maybe you’re even ready to download a product spec sheet or submit a form for more information. Possibly even make a purchase. You’ve got some down time on a Tuesday evening while sitting on the couch at home, so you grab your phone, which is obviously sitting right next to you, and you open up your favorite search app — Chrome or Safari — and you Google “top project management tools for business.” The first three or four results on the page — ones that you’re likely to click on — are paid ads, also known as AdWords. As a business owner, if you’re not running Google AdWords you’re missing out on a huge opportunity to acquire new leads. Roughly 80 percent of all online searches happen on Google. Searching often correlates with intent; intent to begin the research process, learn something new, contact a company, and potentially make a purchase. When done right, advertising through Google AdWords is an effective tactic within your marketing strategy. Before integrating AdWords into your marketing, ask yourself the following questions: Do you have the resources to maintain it? AdWords is not a “set it and forget it” service. Without ongoing campaign maintenance and optimization, your AdWords campaigns will perform terribly and you’ll essentially be wasting your money. On the other hand, a well-optimized campaign can help you beat competitors while actually spending less. Pro Tip: Do not hire an intern to maintain your AdWords campaign. AdWords is a very elaborate system — it’s best to leave it to the pros. Do you have a responsive website? Given that over half of all searches take place on a mobile device (yes, even in B2B markets), if you send your new audience to a poorly optimized website, they’re going to hit the “back" button faster than you can say, “AdWords.” Have you clearly defined your goals and objectives? Because of the time, effort and expertise it takes to run an AdWords campaign, it can be a large expense. Just like any marketing initiative, it is critical to define your goals up front so you can determine your success. Define your target conversion rates and cost-per-acquisition. Do a bit of math to ensure that your investment will generate a return for you. AdWords will not save your business If you’re selling a terrible product and have poor messaging, AdWords won’t save you. Those fundamentals need to be in place prior to investing in AdWords. AdWords is just one tool within your marketing toolbox. Be sure that all your efforts are integrated to produce the best results for your company.

[Continuously updated] April Fools' Roundup: All the jokes from around the web Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 4:17pm PDTMar 31, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares211 Google News T-Mobile Videos Article Contents 1 Google Gnome 2 Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps 3 Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard 4 Google Assistant 5 Google Wind 6 Netflix Live 7 T-Mobile ONEsie 8 Hulu Hu 9 OnePlus Dash drink 10 Lyft Mono 11 Honor BFF 12 Google Haptic Helpers 13 Amazon Petlexa 14 Contour by SlickWraps 15 Nvidia GTX G-Assist 16 Google's data center on Mars April Fools Day is almost upon us, but some companies aren't waiting to share their pranks. Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrates to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. At the time of writing, it's still March 31 in some time zones, so we'll likely see more gags show up as time goes on.

Google explains why the Android Wear 2.0 rollout was delayed for some watches Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/30 9:44am PDTMar 30, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 32 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 Android Wear News You might have heard about Valve Time - the tendency for video game company Valve to release games and features long after the intended date. Google is also guilty of this, with apps and features still rolling out weeks after being announced. Many Android Wear users were left wondering why their watches had not received the much-anticipated 2.0 update weeks after the rollout supposedly started, but know we know why. Google has confirmed to Wareable.com that the update was delayed to fix a bug. We haven't asked Google ourselves, but this is the statement provided by Wareable: "We have started rolling out the Android Wear 2.0 update to Fossil Q Founder, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10 and Tag Heuer Connected. For other devices, the update is currently being delayed due to a bug found in final testing. We will push the update to the remaining devices as soon as the issue is resolved." Considering Android Wear 2.0 was initially slated for a late 2016 release, and was even delayed, it's rather annoying that all the bugs were not properly ironed out already. But pushing a buggy update to users probably wouldn't have worked out very well. Source: Wareable Tags android wear android wear 2.0 bug delayed rollout subscribe ...

Morten Ulv How would developers have their aps ready? Morten Ulv How would developers have their apps ready? :) Đức Thành It's nothing serious, but this is just another example of poor planning. Please don't turn this into a habit, Google. I love Google, but honestly nobody wants to hear your excuses when you are doing business. Especially when all of this could be solved very easily if you just wait until the final product is ready *before* announcing a release date. demarcmj It's already become a habit. Đức Thành Worse, it might become an addiction. mattcoz Stop being ridiculous, if they planned for the possibility of bugs then it would never get released. Nothing is ever released completely free of bugs. They never announced a date for the update of older devices. Đức Thành I was being very reasonable, in fact. You are correct that it is nearly impossible to plan for the possibility of bugs, but that wasn't the point. The point is Google should learn how to do estimations more accurately, and move the release date to a more appropriate time, preferably later than how they usually do it. If you are going to release it late anyway (and this has happened a bunch of times, there's no reason Google can't learn from it), why not announce the ETA a little bit later and take more time to prepare, instead of making the service users wait in anticipation? There is always unknown risks and it's probably not possible yet to account for all the possibilities things could go wrong, but risks are something that can be managed. NexusMan It was announced 2 weeks ago I'd get it by the end of this month...And I got it yesterday. Đức Thành Well that's not too bad then? I was making the comments based on the observation that Google missed the deadline they set for themselves for some of the devices. Two questions though: What is your device and does the timely update for your device also apply for all other devices? Actually, if the answer to that last question is "no," I've got one more question: Have you read the article? (Not trying to be rude or anything, just curious.) NexusMan In February, in a blog post, Google announced "Android Wear 2.0 will be available for all supported watches in the coming weeks." Still not sure what your complaint is. Yesterday was "the coming weeks" from February and unless the world ends, there are still more weeks to come. mattcoz The point is, no matter how long they wait to there is a chance something will crop up afterwards. It happens, that's why it's only an estimate. Đức Thành The point is Google can learn to make better estimations. NexusMan You're right. They should just do like Samsung and release devices that catch on fire. Rush everything...Software, devices and batteries to market. Who cares if it's ready? Đức Thành If that was sarcasm, I think you might have missed my point. To clarify, my point wasn't for Google to "release products on time according to the announced ETA," but to "make sure most of the preparation for the product launch are well taken care of *and then* announce an ETA for the products." Whether there was a misunderstanding or I not, I hope I have made it clear. NexusMan I didn't miss your point. My point is stuff happens. Frawlz You would have thought this is what the beta was for...... Stephen Cornwell Until it's released it's still pre-release software, as the quote says the bud we was found in final testing we're talking about a release candidate, which is where bugs are found. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Bugs are found at every stage. Even after release. With each phase a wider range of devices are exposed to the software raising the likelihood for a bug to surface. JD With Google its always beta Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Popular opinion is that the bug is Qualcomm/SnapDragon related, hence the earlier release of the update for Intel chipset watches: Fossil, Tag Heuer, Casio. The other guess is that this bug has something to do with battery drain or faulty power management, something some of the new LG watches (Sport, Style) seem to suffer from. Still, using the Dev Preview on my Huawei Watch I haven't experienced any bad battery, I still get around 1.5 days with always on screen and tilt to wake using my own watch-face/launcher. Corbin Davenport Maybe, the Polar M600 is also getting the update now, and it has a MediaTek processor. Matt Mine isn't. I contacted Polar the other day and support said they had no new news about when it was going out. Matt "We were told it was going to be released mid to late March. Unfortunately we don't have an ETA on that release data but it should be very soon." That was March 22. Matt Of course now I see the latest article. Nicholas Polydor BTW, @corbin_davenport , the site is Wareable.com not Wearable.com (not that I'm sure why they spelt it that way, mind!) TheJester Polar comfirmed me the update until end of next week on twitter. Rob Smith I have Polar M600, and I got update last night! Andy Webber Could be something introduced after the last beta. mattcoz Most likely the case, and they were probably focused on testing for the SD2100 leading up to the release. Jordan L Solid analysis. Also, I get about 1.5days on my Huawei Watch w/ Dev Preview, using a WatchMaker face too. King_Android "We found a bug, that we are trying to iron out" = The quickest way to stop us nerds from complaining so much. demarcmj Google was good at updating stuff when they only had a few devices to worry about. They have been progressively becoming worse and worse as the amount of "stuff" to manage has grown. This "bug" non-explanation is the same excuse they gave for making Nexus 6 users wait on 7.0. In that case, as well as this, there was a lengthy beta program that is ostensibly supposed to be used to iron out the bugs. mattcoz That's generally how it works, and no beta period ever irons out all the bugs. kenspiracy Honestly, with everything I've heard about how AW2.0 handles notifications, I'm not even sure I want the update on my Moto 360. Leonardo Baez If it is 1st gen it wont update kenspiracy It's not. Stephen Cornwell I've been running it for months, the notifications are much better than 1.0. jstew182 I have been searching for a while now trying to find a good video showing how notifications work on 2.0. Does the name of the person still stay at the bottom of the screen when they message you or does it show an icon or what? thespacecowboy How about not launching a product/release until it's ready? This was updated/posted early February, nearly two months ago. https://developer.android.com/wear/index.html Middlefinger Dont be daft, this is Google we are talking about. mattcoz Maybe the bug didn't present itself until after the release when testing on older hardware. Đức Thành Sorry but that's not an explanation, that's an excuse. Then why not test the software on those older hardware? mattcoz That's when the bug appeared, during testing. jubby2000 Wareable* Mitch Brown I am all for Google doing quality control. I would rather wait longer and get something that works. Anyone who has run a Windows based system knows what working with bugs in the system is like. That's what I like about Android, I experience very few problems working with Android or Chrome OS. Can't say the same for Windows 10. Aditya Singh I have fossil q founder 2.0. When will my watch get android wear 2 ? George Garrett Must be a serious bug. Huawei replaced my Nexus 6p after they said the Android 7.0 update nuked a third of my battery capacity; and that was an actual release. The wear 2.0 update must've done something terrible. Stoneule Hilarious. Once again Google is finding ways to destroy Android Wear. Incredible really. In fact is there anything from io2016 that wasn't a complete disaster? I'll say it for the 100th time, get rid of Sundar. Google needs new leadership JD Oh Google no one cares for your BS excuses. You're not a startup anymore. Nick Coad Cool, now explain to me why the LG Sport and LG Style are so shit. NexusMan Because they're made by LG. Teja Seriously, Android Wear is where Google is not good enough to compete with Samsung Gear both in terms of battery life and software experience. Sad. roflcopter pilot delays happen. unfortunately so does shitty communication. Sean Thomas AW 2.0 announced at IO 2016....just going to be rolling out to devices by IO 2017. Good job Google lmao. Rob Smith I got AW 2.0 for M600 TODAY! Martin Buerkle Yeah big bummer. I got the 2nd Gen Moto 360 and got it because It seemed to be getting the update on schedule. And the new Google Sport of course was sold out day one and the thickness is really ugly. Hopefully Google gets their act together, many products and apps are suffering from human incompetence.

An investigation by The Times first revealed that YouTube was displaying adverts by the British government and some big companies alongside extremist material, including hate speech and antisemitic content. The UK government, followed by several companies, withdrew their adverts from Google. The boycott has expanded internationally and could cost Google up to $750 million (£601 million) in sales. This week Australian companies withdrew advertising from YouTube after learning their ads appeared next to undesirable content. The Australian government is following suit. Senator Scott Ryan, Australia’s special minister of state, said: “The Australian government has decided to make immediate changes to its advertising placement policy and is suspending non-corporate… Want to read more?

The trick works on mobile apps and, it would appear, will also be active on the web browser version of Google Maps when the time is right. A version of 'Ms. Pac-Man' has been available for Android devices via Google Play since 2011, on iOS since 2008. — Picture courtesy of Bandai Namco Entertainment America Inc. / iTunes Pressing a "Ms. Pac-Man" icon or changing the map view to Insert Coin activates the video game mode, in which users are given five chances to outrun the Pac-Man ghosts, Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde, and consume enough power pellets to get them back. A similar April Fools’ Day joke ran in 2015, using Pac-Man as its motif. Then, as now, Google rolled out the special Maps mode on the 35th anniversary of its arcade cabinet inspiration. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Lazada launches ‘Lovezada’ dating app (VIDEO) Major internet providers say will not sell customer browsing histories Google Maps channels ‘Ms. Pac-Man’ for April Fools Snapchat adds more accessible search feature Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Find the stations with the cheapest petrol with MyPetrol app China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Stephen Hawking appears as hologram in Hong Kong Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Google allows users to share their locations in mapping app Google Street Maps takes cameras into the bowels of the earth: Volcanoes Google announces Maps update to highlight areas of interest (VIDEO) Google Maps adds multi-stop routes, memories to mobile Google ups detail on Maps, Earth imagery Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

As such, companies like Google took to the internet to “announce” several upcoming products that are too good (and funny) to be true. Which April Fool’s Day product announcement from Google was your favorite? As per tradition, Google had product announcements from multiple departments within the company. These include Google Gnome, a Home smart assistant speaker to be used outside which packs with it much more sass than the standard model, VR Haptic Helpers, an on-call team who come to your home to help make VR more immersive, as well as Google Wind, a project based in Holland that uses windmills to blow away bad weather. On top of all of these hilarious announcements, if you launch Google Maps, you will see a button to turn your neighborhood into a Ms. Pac-Man game. And if that isn’t enough, the Chrome team has announced a new line of mobile accessories exclusively for Chromebook users so that they can use Google Cardboard and even take Groupies! If you haven’t yet, make sure to go read our full April Fool’s Day roundup article. It showcases all of these hilarious fake Google products as well as several others from companies such as T-Mobile, OnePlus, and even iFixit.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrates to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. At the time of writing, it's still March 31 in some time zones, so we'll likely see more gags show up as time goes on.

Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?"

Instead of the classic "doodle" — a fun picture or game on the www.google.com search bar — smart phone users got a surprise in the maps app: Ms. Pac-Man! Here's how to get started. When you open the app, it should look like this. Google Maps screenshot, courtesy of Tyler O'Neil For a better view, flip it sideways.

[Continuously updated] April Fools' Roundup: All the jokes from around the web Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 4:17pm PDTMar 31, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares211 Google News T-Mobile Videos Article Contents 1 Google Gnome 2 Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps 3 Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard 4 Google Assistant 5 Google Wind 6 Netflix Live 7 T-Mobile ONEsie 8 Hulu Hu 9 OnePlus Dash drink 10 Lyft Mono 11 Honor BFF 12 Google Haptic Helpers 13 Amazon Petlexa 14 Contour by SlickWraps 15 Nvidia GTX G-Assist 16 Google's data center on Mars April Fools Day is almost upon us, but some companies aren't waiting to share their pranks. Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrates to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. At the time of writing, it's still March 31 in some time zones, so we'll likely see more gags show up as time goes on.

[Continuously updated] April Fools' Roundup: All the jokes from around the web Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 4:17pm PDTMar 31, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares211 Google News T-Mobile Videos Article Contents 1 Google Gnome 2 Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps 3 Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard 4 Google Assistant 5 Google Wind 6 Netflix Live 7 T-Mobile ONEsie 8 Hulu Hu 9 OnePlus Dash drink 10 Lyft Mono 11 Honor BFF 12 Google Haptic Helpers 13 Amazon Petlexa 14 Contour by SlickWraps 15 Nvidia GTX G-Assist 16 Google's data center on Mars April Fools Day is almost upon us, but some companies aren't waiting to share their pranks. Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrates to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. At the time of writing, it's still March 31 in some time zones, so we'll likely see more gags show up as time goes on.

The high-tech glove, which lets users hail a ride without pulling out their phone, is one of the April Fools’ Day jokes rolled out by tech companies in advance of April 1. By Marisa Kendall | mkendall@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 31, 2017 at 5:28 pm | UPDATED: March 31, 2017 at 11:53 pm Things were starting to get weird in Silicon Valley on Friday. Ghosts chased Ms. Pac Man through the streets of Google Maps. A cat ordered sushi using an Amazon Echo. And Alamo revealed a new fleet of cars that drive themselves, plan your vacation and take pictures of your trip. Just kidding. As usual, companies in the Bay Area and beyond engaged in their annual April Fools’ Day hijinks this week, with more expected on the big day Saturday. The wide range of pranks — many mocking Silicon Valley’s tech-obsessed culture — are part of a long tradition that gives businesses ranging from small startups to global corporate giants a chance to show off their senses of humor. Google  launched a Pac Man feature on Google Maps on Friday that let users waste hours at work helping Ms. Pac Man gobble up dots and avoid a pack of colorful ghosts. The company followed up hours later with the release of Google Gnome, its smart personal assistant for the yard, which looks like, you guessed it, a garden gnome wearing a red, pointed hat. Google Gnome can answer questions like “which way is the wind blowing?”, turn your garden hose on and off, and even take control of lawnmowers or leaf blowers, according to its webpage. Lyft got things going Thursday, giving fans a sneak peek of  “autonomous ride-hailing” with a new gadget called Mono. When wearing the device, essentially a high-tech glove, users can request a ride without even bothering to pull out their smartphones. “With Mono, we want to make the entire ridesharing process as seamless as possible,” Lyft wrote in a blog post, “whether you’re a bellman who can’t whistle or a mom with her hands full; a nudist who needs a ride or a millennial who just can’t even.” Related Articles Silicon Valley ignores April Fools’ Day — April Fools! April Fools’ Day: Memorable pranks in Silicon Valley Taking a swipe at the autonomous vehicle craze sweeping Silicon Valley, rental car company Alamo promised a “self-driving, self-vacationing” fleet of cars that pilot themselves, create vacation itineraries and even snap pictures of your trip. “With the ability to flip their seats around to face backseat passengers, travelers will have unlimited options for activities in the car, including taking naps, reading a book or playing cards,” the company wrote. Netflix users who tuned in early Friday were treated to a preview of “Netflix Live,” a 48-minute recording featuring actor Will Arnett narrating mundane goings-on like making toast and putting together a puzzle. Man Crates, a Redwood City-based startup that ships gift boxes catering to men, got in on the act with Man Freights, which lets users ship themselves off to someone in a human-size crate. Just head down to the company’s San Jose shipping location, customer service rep Shawn Samson said Friday, and the team will box you up and give you a bicycle helmet. For protection, of course. “We’ll drill some holes for air,” Samson said, refusing to admit the idea was a hoax, “and then ship you via FedEx.” Eaze, a San Francisco-based medical marijuana delivery app, said customers who placed orders Saturday would have their products delivered by an exotic animal — possibly a bear or an ostrich. The company also (no fooling) will be donating $1 per delivery to the Wildlife Conservation Society. Ownage Pranks, which broadcasts a popular YouTube channel of prank call videos, launched an app that lets users send prerecorded prank calls to their friends — or enemies. There were plenty more. Amazon debuted its Petlexa technology, which lets virtual home assistant Echo communicate with animals. Santa Clara-based Chegg, an online platform where students rent, buy and sell textbooks, unleashed Chugg, a  neon orange energy drink that boasts 11,200 calories in a 12-ounce can. Honda created car horn emojis so drivers can “safely express emotions.” San Francisco-based real estate website Trulia launched listings for pets. And Stack Overflow, a New York-based networking platform for developers, implemented “dance dance authentication,” — a security system that requires you to bust a few dance moves to unlock your computer or smartphone. “We built the DDA protocol based on tens of thousands of hours of dancing videos,” a narrator said in a Stack video. “To ensure viability, we dog-fed the UI internally, developing the core choreographic technology using a deep house neural net.” Tags:  Amazon Google Marisa Kendall Marisa Kendall is a technology reporter for The Mercury News, where she covers venture capital and startups.

This year’s April Fool’s is no different, and in a way this year’s “prank” is actually a rather fun one. If you were to head on over to Google Maps on your desktop, or launch the app on your smartphone, you’ll notice a button at the bottom left corner of your screen that when you press will launch a game of Ms. Pac-Man. The best part of this is that instead of using pre-generated maps, Google Maps will actually use the roads around your area (or any area that you choose) to play the game on. All users have to do is use the arrow keys on their keyboard to move their character around, or if you’re playing on a smartphone, just swipe your way around the map. It’s a fun game and if you’re looking to get some laughs or just a couple of minutes of entertainment, the game should be more than up for the task. In fact you could even challenge yourself by changing locations and maps if you want to make things interesting. This isn’t the first time that Google has turned to Pac-Man for its “jokes”, and who knows, maybe this could prove to be popular enough where Google could keep it around for the future!

Google Wants This April Fool's Day To Be The Very Best, Kicks Things Off With A Google Maps Pokémon Challenge Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2014/03/31 9:04am PDTMar 31, 2014 588 Plus 1 on G+ 10705 Share on Facebook 1 Share on Twitter Total Shares11294 Google News The kids who obsessed about Nintendo's Pokémon in the late 1990s are now the up-and-comers at some of the world's biggest technology companies. If you don't believe us, then check out the following video: Yup, Google is back to its April 1st tricks, and they're going all-out this year. The video sets up an augmented reality game that lets you go out into the world and catch "real" Pokémon through you phone's camera. That's the April Fool's joke. But since this is Google, it doesn't just end with the video - as of right now, Google Maps on Android and iOS is actually populated with Pokémon creatures all over the world. Zoom in to major cities and you'll see Nintendo's little critters hanging out on the standard map view (you have to zoom in really far). Some places, like the Google headquarters, also have pixelated buildings overlaid on the map. Tap a Pokémon and you can "catch" it, adding it to your own personal Pokedex (a monster catalog from the game series). "Catching" a Pokémon will populate your Pokedex with a portrait, game-accurate statistics, and flavor text. Pokémon fans, feel free to go completely nuts.    There are 150 Pokémon that can be caught, though we're seeing some of them that aren't from the original Red/Blue/Yellow generations. You can get back to your Pokedex by tapping the Search field while it's empty. The location of each Pokémon is not searchable, but they're persistent, showing up in the same places for each user. That means it should be possible for players to work together and catalog locations for each Pokémon. That's right - you can catch 'em all. If you can't find a Pokémon near you location, search for "Googleplex" and zoom in. There are a bunch of them just waiting to be caught. Thanks, Eirik!

[Continuously updated] April Fools' Roundup: All the jokes from around the web Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 4:17pm PDTMar 31, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares211 Google News T-Mobile Videos Article Contents 1 Google Gnome 2 Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps 3 Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard 4 Google Assistant 5 Google Wind 6 Netflix Live 7 T-Mobile ONEsie 8 Hulu Hu 9 OnePlus Dash drink 10 Lyft Mono 11 Honor BFF 12 Google Haptic Helpers 13 Amazon Petlexa 14 Contour by SlickWraps 15 Nvidia GTX G-Assist 16 Google's data center on Mars April Fools Day is almost upon us, but some companies aren't waiting to share their pranks. Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrates to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. At the time of writing, it's still March 31 in some time zones, so we'll likely see more gags show up as time goes on. Let us know in the comments below if you find any more that we didn't cover.   Tags April Fools Day bubble wrap dash energy drink Google google assistant google gnome google maps google wind hulu mrs pac man netflix netflix live oneplus pack-man T-Mobile video subscribe ...

Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day. I just wish everyone kept up the pranks for the entire month like I do. Oddly enough..

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars OFFBEAT All of Google’s jokes for April Fools’ Day 2017 Emil Protalinski@EPro March 31, 2017 5:32 PM Tags: April Fools, april fools' day, Google April Fools’ Day is upon us, and like every year, Google is doing its best to outdo itself. The restructuring that put Google under the new Alphabet parent company didn’t have an impact on last year’s gags, so we’re expecting the usual: Jokes ranging from ridiculously lame to very clever, spanning the simple blog post or video to the elaborate gag or new feature. Google’s various divisions always create more practical and impractical jokes than any other tech firm, and it’s simply hard to keep track of them all. As a result, we have put together our usual annual roundup. Ms. Pac Maps Pac-Man in Google Maps was so popular in 2015, a Google spokesperson told us, that this year the company is introducing Ms. Pac-Maps. The game is available on Google Maps for Android and iOS, and should also be rolling out on the desktop. Compared to the previous version, the scoring system has been updated, you can now save your score by signing in, the game is much more easy to find on Android and iOS (right above the compass), and the fruit are different from the Pac-Maps variation. The game will be live until April 4. Waze expands to Mars Waze has been “approached by a leading extraterrestrial exploratory organization to build a more thorough and informative map of the fourth rock from the sun.” The Google-owned company is leaning on its leading map editors from the U.S., Russia, and Italy to help map out Mars. And don’t worry, your service won’t be affected since Waze has fired up a “special space-focused server” on its web-based Waze Map Editor platform for this small group. “So far, landing sites are simply marked as Places, dust storms/volcano activity are Major Traffic Events, and broken-down Rovers as potential road hazards.” Google Cloud Platform also expands to Mars It’s like this company hasn’t heard of any other planets. Google Cloud Platform is adding a new region: “we’re looking to the future cloud infrastructure needed for the exploration and ultimate colonization of the Red Planet.” The company’s first interplanetary data center, nicknamed “Ziggy Stardust,” will open in 2018. It will power “a dedicated extraterrestrial cloud region” that will serve as “an important node in an extensive network throughout the solar system.” The whole thing started as a 20 percent project with the “Google Planets team,” which found a suitable location in Gale Crater, near the landing site of NASA’s Curiosity rover. Best of all, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is launching a new Earth-Mars Multi-Regional location so users can store planet-redundant data across Earth and Mars. Google Wind Google Netherlands has huge ambitions. Because it rains so much in the country (about 145 days a year), the Cloud Platform team has decided controlling the weather is a great idea. By leveraging machine learning and weather patterns, Google Wind controls the network of windmills across the country to disperse clouds when it’s about to rain. They can already provide sun and clear skies for everyone in the Netherlands, and maybe the rest of the world one day. Google Gnome If Google Home is for the home, then Google Gnome is for the backyard. The voice-activated, hands-free tool is really just a rip-off Google Home that can tell you what animal is in your bushes, use proprietary high-intensity lasers to trim your hedges, inform you which way the wind is blowing, and really tell you anything else you want to know about the outdoors. Oh, but don’t ask it indoor questions. Google Gnome doesn’t like that. Haptic Helpers Virtual Reality is too dependent on visual and audio experiences. Google’s Haptic Helpers take VR to the next level by simulating more than 10,000 unique experiences: “Smell the roses. Listen to the ocean. Feel a fluffy dog!” Bubble Wrap Keyboard The Google Japan input team has a modern twist on sending Morse Code: Use bubble wrap! To use it, pop specific bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet and then feed it through a bubble wrap reader to send the message.

Rugged, spill-proof exterior. 2-in-1 convertible form factor. Support for Google for Education administration and features. Cons Low-resolution screen. No USB-C ports. Bottom Line The Dell Chromebook 3189 is a durable convertible laptop, with a long-lasting battery, a multimode hinge, and enough processing juice to help power online and classroom learning. By Joel Santo Domingo As its name implies, the Dell Chromebook 3189 Education 2-in-1 (starts at $349; $389 as tested) is a convertible laptop made with students in mind. It delivers all-day battery life, and is built tough enough to handle all the abuse that school-age children can dish out. And since it supports school-administered Google for Education accounts, this reasonably priced chromebook can be shared among students and managed by teachers or school IT staffers, making it a welcome addition to the classroom. //Compare Similar Products Compare Asus Chromebook Flip (C302CA-DHM4)   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Chromebook 11 Non-Touch   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 15 (CB3-532-C47C)   %displayPrice%%seller% CTL J5 Chromebook   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad 11e Chromebook   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 14   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 14 for Work   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Chromebook 13 G1   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo N22-20 Touch Chromebook   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook R 13 (CB5-312T-K5X4)   %displayPrice%%seller% Hanging Tough The Chromebook 3189 has a rounded edge surrounding its black, polycarbonate exterior, but is otherwise devoid of any design flair. It measures 0.8 by 12 by 8.2 inches (HWD) and weighs 3.16 pounds. That's a bit thicker and heavier than the Asus Chromebook Flip, our top pick for chromebooks, but the Chromebook 3189's rugged construction is the reason for the added heft. View All 10 Photos in Gallery Since it's MIL-STD 810G tested and rated, the Chromebook 3189 can withstand extreme temperatures, rapid changes in altitude, blowing sand and dust, shock and vibration, and drops up to 30 inches onto a wooden surface. The rounded edges are rubberized, and there are two long rubber strips on the bottom panel to help prevent the laptop from sliding around. The chiclet-style keyboard is sealed against liquids, and the top lid is scratch-resistant. This chromebook is designed to survive all day in the classroom, as well as trips back and forth from home in a school bag packed with textbooks along with school and sports supplies. Made to Touch The 2-in-1 convertible form factor means that you can pivot the screen 360 degrees around its dual hinges, allowing you to use the touch screen in traditional Laptop mode, Tent mode (with the keyboard pointed away, and the hinge pointing upward), Stand mode (with the keyboard flat on the table, and the screen angled in front), or Tablet mode (with the keyboard folded away 360 degrees, and the screen up and exposed). The touch screen is responsive, and comes in handy for both data entry and on-screen drawing and note-taking. The 11.6-inch display has a low 1,366-by-768 resolution, which is the minimum required for chromebooks. Full HD screens, like the one on the Asus Chromebook Flip and the Acer Chromebook 14, are still rarities, and we don't consider full HD an absolute necessity for use in a school setting. Using a lower-resolution screen on the Chromebook 3189 eases the strain on the Intel Celeron N3060 processor, since it doesn't have to process the extra pixels. Native 720p and downscaled 1080p videos displayed smoothly on the panel in our tests, though downscaled 4K videos stuttered and paused often for processing. In addition to easing the burden on the processor, the lower-resolution screen also uses less power than a full HD or 4K screen, leading to better battery life. Like its predecessor, the Dell Chromebook 11 Non-Touch, the Chromebook 3189 has a multicolored Dell Activity Light on the top-right corner of the lid, that a teacher can use to make sure all students in the class are on the same page, are online, or are ready (say, for an exam to start). Or it can be used by a student to signal the teacher in lieu of a raised hand. An API for the light is available online, so you can integrate various colored lights into your teaching programs. The keyboard is optimized for Chrome OS. That means that instead of the standard F1-F12 keys, the top row of function keys are labeled with icons for forward/back, reload, full-screen, toggling Overview mode (to show all windows at once), screen brightness, screen lock, and volume controls. There's a dedicated Search key in place of the Caps Lock key, since you would likely use the search function more often in the web-based Chrome OS. Key action is smooth, and the keyboard itself is very sturdy. There's no keyboard flex at all, something that will help the laptop survive being shared among grade-school students. Like the keyboard, the one-piece touchpad is also sealed against spills. There's a good selection of connectivity ports, including a headset jack on the right side of the laptop, as well as an HDMI port, a microSD card reader (which accepts up to 256GB cards) for extra local storage, a power connector, and two USB 3.0 ports on the left panel. There are no USB-C ports, which are pretty rare on chromebooks right now. Integrated 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 handle wireless connections. Like all chromebooks, this laptop runs the stripped-down ChromeOS operating system. It basically uses the Chrome browser as its main interface to the web, eschewing storage-space-filling programs like Microsoft Office. On the flip side, if your school uses Windows programs developed in-house, or off-the-shelf apps, you may be out of luck trying to run them on ChromeOS. Also, the Chromebook 3189 doesn't yet support Android apps, though compatibility could be added in the future, as ChromeOS automatically updates itself over the internet when available. A Look Inside Our review configuration has 32GB of fast SSD storage. There are also Chromebook 3189 models available with 16GB ($329) and 64GB ($409) SSDs. We think 32GB of storage is large enough for Chrome OS, because students will likely save their work in the cloud-based Google Drive that comes with each Google for Education account. As long as your school has more than four users, Google includes unlimited storage online, or 1TB each for one to four users. Google for Education is free to all accredited nonprofit education organizations. The 4GB of RAM, which is standard for all three versions, isn't expandable, but it should be sufficient for basic web and office app functions. In testing, we were able to keep a half dozen actively updated websites and a streaming audio site running simultaneously. The Intel Celeron N3060 is the only processor available on the Chromebook 3189, and it is fast enough for tasks like browsing education sites, light drawing and coloring in grade-school art classes, and viewing videos from sites like PBS.com. It might be a little light on power compared with, say, the Intel Core m3 chip in the Asus Chromebook Flip, but the Chrome OS and browser runs well on this budget-priced CPU. We weren't able to run our Windows-based benchmark tests on the laptop, but it felt snappy while leading and navigating between websites. We could easily edit a letter in Google Docs, stream music from Spotify, and chat in Slack simultaneous, for example. As long as you keep the number of active tabs below 12, you should be fine. Windows systems in this price range are likely to have Celeron or lower-power processors, like the Intel Atom CPU in the Asus Transformer Mini (T102HA-D4-GR). Our Editors' Choice budget Windows 2-in-1 convertible, the Lenovo Yoga 710, goes for $549, and like the Asus Chromebook Flip comes with a speedier Intel Core m3 processor. See How We Test Laptops The 42WHr battery pack is sealed into the chassis, and can't be swapped out. That's not likely to be an issue, though, since the Chromebook 3189 lasted an impressive 11 hours and 39 minutes in our battery rundown test. When fully charged, the laptop will last an entire school day, and still have enough juice for homework afterward. It's still an hour longer than the Asus Chromebook Flip (10:23), which has a higher power drain from its full HD screen, but there are other chromebooks that returned longer run times, including the Acer Chromebook 15 (14:17) and the CTL J5 Chromebook (12:21). Ready for School The Dell Chromebook 3189 Education 2-in-1 is an attractive choice for the school environment, thanks to its relatively low price, decent feature set, durable construction, and long-lasting battery. For non-students, we still prefer the Asus Chromebook Flip, our Editors' Choice chromebook, since its metal exterior, faster processor, and larger full HD screen make it a better fit in a home-entertainment capacity. If you're willing to give up the convertible hinge, the $230 Lenovo N22-20 Touch Chromebook is a utilitarian clamshell chromebook that will save you a few bucks. And if you absolutely must have Windows, the Asus Transformer Mini is a decent (if slowish) alternative for about the same price. That said, if you're filling out a purchase order for a few dozen (or a few hundred) units at a time for your educational institution, the Chromebook 3189 should be on your short list.

By Corazon Victorino On 03/31/17 AT 8:23 PM Close Just a day after announcing that it is delaying the release of Android Wear 2.0 to other smartwatches, Google appears to have finally addressed the problem with the smartwatch operating system and is now rolling it out to more devices. Starting this Friday, five more wearables are getting updated to the latest version of Android Wear.  Previously, IBTimes reported that the Mountain View giant has decided to delay the rollout of Android Wear 2.0 to more smartwatches after learning of a software bug that’s plaguing the OS. Google then did not give a specific time frame or date as to when the new OS would be releasing to other devices. Interestingly, a day after the announcement, Google is now saying that Android Wear 2.0 is already available to five more smartwatches.  The high-tech timepieces that will be getting the update starting this Friday are the Fossil Q Wander, Fossil Q Marshal, Michael Kors Access, Nixon Mission and the Polar M600. Aside from the five, Google has confirmed that the update has already been made available for the Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10, Fossil Q Founder and TAG Heuer Connected. Adding up all of these, Google is already rolling out its new operating system to almost half of the 19 older wearables that have been confirmed to receive the update, as pointed out by Engadget. Given that the latest version of Android Wear is already coming to five more devices, the hold up is unlikely to last that longer. It’s possible that Google would be updating the remaining units out of the said 19 as early as next week.  Google first announced Android Wear 2.0 almost one year ago during its 2016 I/O developers conference. The new smartwatch OS was then expected to release in the fall of last year, but it was delayed to early 2017. On top of the delay, Google has decided to limit the release of the software to select smartwatches, leaving many other older devices out of the equation.  More smartwatches are getting updated to Android Wear 2.0 starting this Friday.

[Continuously updated] April Fools' Roundup: All the jokes from around the web Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 4:17pm PDTMar 31, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares211 Google News T-Mobile Videos Article Contents 1 Google Gnome 2 Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps 3 Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard 4 Google Assistant 5 Google Wind 6 Netflix Live 7 T-Mobile ONEsie 8 Hulu Hu 9 OnePlus Dash drink 10 Lyft Mono 11 Honor BFF 12 Google Haptic Helpers 13 Amazon Petlexa 14 Contour by SlickWraps 15 Nvidia GTX G-Assist 16 Google's data center on Mars April Fools Day is almost upon us, but some companies aren't waiting to share their pranks. Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrates to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. At the time of writing, it's still March 31 in some time zones, so we'll likely see more gags show up as time goes on. Let us know in the comments below if you find any more that we didn't cover.   Tags April Fools Day bubble wrap dash energy drink Google google assistant google gnome google maps google wind hulu mrs pac man netflix netflix live oneplus pack-man T-Mobile video subscribe ...

Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?"

As car factories fell silent, as homes fell dark, as rubbish piled up in the streets, people would ask in frustration: ‘Who governs? The government? Or the unions?’ The answer was a long time coming. It was only after the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, with a mandate to tame the union leaders’ power, end the culture of industrial militancy and reassert the sovereignty of the British government, that the question was finally consigned to the history books. Four decades on, I believe it has returned to the heart of British politics.  For, as in the Seventies, the Government finds itself heading for confrontation with a group of remote, unaccountable and increasingly militant opponents, who treat our nation’s elected leaders with contempt and set their own interests above those of the British people. Tech giants' defiance of social responsibility and contempt for national security is becoming one of the defining issues of our age, writes Dominic Sandbrook (file photo) I am talking, of course, about the gigantic multinational technology companies — Google, Facebook, Apple, Uber and the like — whose defiance of social responsibility and contempt for national security is becoming one of the defining issues of our age. Two days ago, the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, summoned representatives of the major tech firms to Whitehall, to express her frustration at their failure to stop terrorists using their services to communicate among themselves and to distribute extremist material. I doubt Ms Rudd offered her guests beer and sandwiches, the symbol of successive Prime Ministers’ futile attempts to rein in the militant union leaders in the Seventies. But I suspect Thursday’s meeting will produce exactly what all those meetings with the union bosses produced 40 years ago: very little. The firms may have promised to crack down on terrorist videos online. Yet that pledge came on the same day the BBC reported that Britain is losing the battle to eradicate extremist websites from the internet. A pledge to track down on terrorist videos online came on the same day the BBC reported that Britain is losing the battle to eradicate extremist websites from the internet (file photo) Yesterday, it revealed that there has been a rise in worldwide searches for extremist key words, reaching half a million last year, including 54,000 searches in Britain alone. What lies behind this latest confrontation between the Government and the big technology firms is the fallout from the dreadful attack in Westminster ten days ago. We now know that the killer, Khalid Masood, sent a message on WhatsApp — the online messaging system owned by Facebook — just moments before his car ploughed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. But we don’t know what it said or to whom he sent it, because the company’s encryption software means the security services cannot access it. So when, last weekend, Ms Rudd said that the Government would like to have the powers to read encrypted messages on social media platforms like WhatsApp, I struggled to see the problem. There has been a rise in worldwide searches for extremist key words, reaching half a million last year, including 54,000 searches in Britain alone (file photo) That doesn’t mean, by the way, that I care nothing for civil liberties. After all, we in Britain are famous for valuing our freedom and bridling at government interference. Yet, as most of us recognise, we want to enjoy that freedom without a madman blowing us up or running us down. When terrorists strike, we don’t simply shrug our shoulders and say: ‘That’s life.’ We wonder why our security services failed to stop them; we try to learn the appropriate lessons, and to make sure it doesn’t happen again. This doesn’t strike me as knee-jerk authoritarianism, just common sense. But, of course, the tech companies and their ultra-libertarian cheerleaders see things rather differently. Cue the hysterical shrieks that the East German Stasi had bugs in everybody’s bedrooms, and that this is the slippery slope to George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, with its Big Brother surveillance. This is, of course, the world view promoted by the Guardian newspaper’s pin-up Edward Snowden, now a grateful guest of Vladimir Putin in Moscow, who leaked tens of thousands of British and American intelligence files to the media in an attempt to discredit the U.S. government’s electronic spying programmes. Ministers have long been campaigning against the easy availability online not just of hardcore pornography, but of images of child abuse and violent jihadist propaganda (file photo) Yet what really baffles me about Mr Snowden and his supporters is that they elevate one principle — liberty — while ignoring all others. I like liberty as much as anybody, but I like security that protects me from being killed, too. Of course, I would prefer not to have my phone and email conversations tapped — but which of us would genuinely elevate our privacy above the lives of innocent men, women and children? I can already hear the howls of protest from the libertarian fringe. But do they really think that the men and women who drive into GCHQ every morning from their suburban Cheltenham homes are itching to become a British Stasi? RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Latest WikiLeaks release shows how the CIA uses computer... Tech giants bow to Amber Rudd's demands to get tough in... Male nurse, 44, who laughed as he showed colleagues a video... Share this article Share Behind all this is a deeper and more serious issue. We will be debating the tension between liberty and security for as long as we are debating anything at all. The bigger question, though, is the looming conflict between national governments and the vast technology giants that think themselves above the nation state. This is not the first time, after all, that the British government has come up against their intransigence: ministers have long been campaigning against the easy availability online not just of hardcore pornography, but of images of child abuse and violent jihadist propaganda. The technology companies, of course, claim that these are nothing to do with them. But they provide a platform for them: surely they cannot duck their responsibility for ever. Thus far, the Government’s early efforts have achieved nothing. What firms such as Uber, Google, Facebook and Apple have in common is that they avoid paying their fair share of taxes (file photo) Two years ago, for instance, David Cameron demanded so-called ‘back doors’ to be built into message encryption software so that the security services would be able to monitor conversations between suspected terrorists. Under pressure from the American-owned technology companies, however, Mr Cameron backed down. And we now know that this was part of a pattern. Last week, the Mail revealed the extraordinary story of how Mr Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, put pressure on London’s then mayor, Boris Johnson, to halt plans to curtail the business model of the American minicab app company, Uber, which has mercilessly eaten away at the livelihoods of black cab drivers in London, and threatens the survival of taxi services in other British cities. What makes this so shocking is not just the fact that Mr Cameron appears to have been influenced by his friendship with Uber’s senior vice-president, Rachel Whetstone. It’s that like so many multinational technology firms, Uber pays tax at a rate so low — effectively just 1 per cent — that it might as well not be paying at all. It is a familiar story. Google, for example, employs almost 2,500 people in this country, but pays a tax rate of just 3 per cent. Indeed, what firms such as Uber, Google, Facebook and Apple have in common is that they avoid paying their fair share of taxes, yet track their customers’ behaviour and hoard their data. In other words, they cynically profit by leeching off every detail of our lives. But the tech firms track their customers’ behaviour and hoard their data. In other words, they cynically profit by leeching off every detail of our lives (file photo) And yet they have the brass neck, the flagrant hypocrisy, to invoke the principles of privacy and freedom when the security services come to call! You can see why Government ministers have become convinced that these over-mighty subjects simply do not care about the wider national interest. Take WhatsApp, the secure online messaging service used by Khalid Masood before the Westminster attack. Its chief executive is a fortysomething U.S. computer programmer named Jan Koum, who is estimated to be worth $9.1 billion. In Koum’s own words: ‘We want to know as little about our users as possible. We don’t know your name, your gender . . . we have not, we do not and we will not ever sell your personal information to anyone. Period. End of story.’ Alas, such pious assurances proved worthless when WhatsApp started sharing more than a billion users’ phone numbers with Facebook, so the latter could target its adverts at individual consumers. Yet this is the same company that has flatly refused to help the Government look at Masood’s phone messages! Little wonder that earlier this week the Defence Secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, accused the technology barons of ‘earning huge revenues but not [being] willing to play their part defending the open society from which they make their money’. If that sounds harsh, just remember that after the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in London four years ago, a Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee blasted one internet company for its failure to inform MI5 that Michael Adebowale, one of the killers, had posted messages which should have sent shivers down our spines. But because the system was automated — in other words, operated by algorithms — no human being had even bothered to find out what was going on. The truth is that companies like these are simply not interested in what national governments want. They see themselves as above the ordinary responsibilities (file photo) The firm was not named by the Parliamentary Committee. But we now know that it was — surprise, surprise — Facebook, which is based in the United States. Bear in mind that these are not just companies: they are global behemoths with unparalleled reach and power. They wield immense influence over millions of ordinary Britons’ lives. Most of us use their products on a daily, even hourly basis: even Amber Rudd, ironically, uses WhatsApp. Yet you would have to go far, I suspect, to find more flagrant examples of corporate irresponsibility. Remember how Apple reacted when the FBI asked them to unlock the iPhone of an Islamist terrorist who took part in an attack that killed 14 people in California in 2015. Did they co-operate? Well, I imagine you can guess the answer. In the end, the FBI, desperate to find out whether the man had associates plotting more attacks, paid a hacker over $1 million to access his mobile phone. In the meantime, Apple smugly sat on what the technology barons and their allies laughably regard as the moral high ground. Perhaps the best example of Silicon Valley’s smug self-righteousness is Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook, who wastes no opportunity to pose as a champion of privacy against the police and intelligence services. When the FBI asked for help unlocking the terrorist’s phone in California, he noisily refused. In a blistering open letter to all Apple customers, Cook warned of the ‘chilling’ privacy breach posed by the agency’s request. If they had to comply over terrorism, he claimed, they might have to do the same for investigators in a tax or divorce case. The truth is that companies like these are simply not interested in what national governments want. They see themselves as above the ordinary responsibilities — such as paying their tax dues — that apply to the rest of us. ‘We will not help any government, including our own, hack or attack any customer anywhere,’ the president of Microsoft declared this week. That, I think, says it all. Not even if there were another 9/11-style atrocity? Not if there were a war? The truth, I think, is that these companies are run by people who see themselves not as members of a national community, but as members of a secretive, super-national digital elite, floating above the common herd on clouds of their own hot air. They are, in fact, precisely the kind of people of whom Theresa May famously said last autumn: ‘If you believe you’re a citizen of the world, then you’re a citizen of nowhere.’ Her words might have been written specifically to describe the tech giants. Indeed, a moment later Mrs May said: ‘If you’re a household name that refuses to work with the authorities even to fight terrorism… I’m putting you on warning. This can’t go on any more.’ Yet the tech giants have not changed their ways. As the past few days have shown beyond doubt, they have no stake in British society and little commitment to the greater good. There is a nice irony in the fact that this issue has come to the fore in the very week that Mrs May sent her letter to Brussels triggering Britain’s exit from the European Union. After all, we have heard much in the last year about ‘taking back control’. But firms like Google and Facebook have much more influence over our daily lives, and far more power for good or ill, than entire legions of EU bureaucrats. Isn’t it time our Government took back control from them, too? Mrs May has shown herself admirably keen to stand up for national identity and the nation state, and I suspect that taking on the technology bosses would prove a very popular battle. Above all, though, it is a battle she must win. It is no exaggeration to say that our national security may well depend upon it.

The telecom giant has partnered with Evie Launcher to bring a new application called ‘AppFlash‘ — a universal search bar that will come pre-installed on the home screens of all Verizon Android handsets for quickly finding apps and web content.   AppFlash is simply a Google search bar replacement, but instead of collecting and sending telemetry data including what you search, handset, apps and other online activities to Google, it will send to Verizon. What’s worse? Just like other pre-installed bloatware apps, Android users can’t uninstall AppFlash quickly, unless they have rooted their phone. AppFlash allows you to search inside apps or browse through listings of nearby restaurants and entertainment. The built-in Google Search can also do all these stuff. So, there’s nothing this app does that a Google search can’t. Then what’s the need for this app? Of course, selling your data to advertisers or other big data companies and make money — thanks to the US Senate that allowed ISPs to collect and sell your data without permission and banned the FCC from ever passing any rule that would limit these powers. Here’s what the privacy policy of AppFlash reads: We collect information about your device and your use of the AppFlash services. This information includes your mobile number, device identifiers, device type and operating system, and information about the AppFlash features and services you use and your interactions with them. We also access information about the list of apps you have on your device. With your permission, AppFlash also collects information about your device’s precise location from your device operating system as well as contact information you store on your device. AppFlash information may be shared within the Verizon family of companies, including companies like AOL who may use it to help provide more relevant advertising within the AppFlash experiences and in other places, including non-Verizon sites, services, and devices. What’s more? There is a ‘Suggested Apps’ section on the AppFlash main screen, which means that those apps have paid Verizon a good price to list on the main screen. How to Get Rid of ‘AppFlash’ on Your Verizon Android Phone Users can get rid of this bloatware in two ways: you can either root your device and remove the app in question, or only disable the app. 1. Root to remove AppFlash from Android: Since the company has made AppFlash a default app on the home screen of its Android handsets to help users search content and browse the internet, the app can not be uninstalled. So, in order to uninstall AppFlash, you are required to root your Android device and then delete the app from your storage memory. 2. Disable AppFlash without Root: Since rooting is a dangerous process that void your device warranty, you can simply disable AppFlash. Disabling bloatware apps on newer phones is easy, as Android has a built-in way to do this, which doesn’t require any root access. Just head on to Settings → Apps (or ‘Applications’ on some phones) → AppFlash. Now open it and click ‘Disable,’ ‘Force Stop’ and then ‘Clear Data’ as well. http://thehackernews.com/2017/03/verizon-appflash-evie.html?m=1 Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Attention, Ms. Pac-Man fans. If you don't already have Google Maps installed on your smartphone, you're going to want to do that today. You can now take a trip down memory lane and play the classic arcade game right inside Google Maps. There goes your weekend. "You can chomp fruit, avoid ghosts, and collect Pac-Dots along city streets in Google Maps worldwide—all as Ms. Pac-Maps," Product Manager David Hendon wrote in a blog post. The feature is available now through Tuesday, April 4, so you better get chomping before it's too late. Just tap on the Ms. Pac-Maps icon on iOS and Android to enter the maze and start chomping away. You can also try it out on your desktop by clicking the Ms. Pac-Maps button at the bottom left of Maps. Be sure to sign in so you can save your top score on the leaderboard and share it with friends. This isn't the first time Google has brought Pac-Man to the masses. One year ago today, the web giant made it possible to play Pac-Man inside Maps. Perhaps this is a new April Fool's Day Eve tradition? In 2010, meanwhile, Google celebrated Pac-Man's 30th anniversary with a homepage doodle that let people play the game right from Google.com.

Google's just kick started its day with a re-release of its 2015 Easter egg on Maps to keep things light early on.. Users can play "Ms. PAC-Maps" on a street of their choice by simply clicking the game's logo in the bottom left corner. It is rather peculiar that the game is the exact replica of what was launched last time around, but users can still enjoy playing it nevertheless. According to Google, the game will be playable until the 4th of April The other Google Maps Easter egg that we saw way before this, in 2013, was the Treasure Hunt game, which also was fun at the time. Google had also made a Pac-Man doodle back in 2010 to celebrate the game's 30th anniversary, and the aforementioned doodle ended up keeping users hooked for hours.

April Fools' Day 2017: A Roundup Of Pranks, Joke Products And Nonsense [Updated] Logan Booker Apr 1, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  april fools Australian Stories clips Share Image: Uncle Tobys The first day of April is always a difficult 24 hours to navigate if you want to avoid being tripped up by some zany product or service announcement from the likes of Google, Microsoft or, as we've seen today, Uncle Tobys and James Squire. To help you stay ahead of the game, we've selected the delicious (and not-so-delicious) fake stuff and put it all in the one place. Turns out, a fair few local companies are adept leg-pullers, so you'll see a mix of international and Australian gags below. Now, let's get started... Lubricate Your Facial Hair With James Squire Image: James Squire Everyone knows how hard it is to keep that hipster beard in check, so why not try a bit of James Squire's "Brewer Dry Hopped Beard Oil" to tame that mane. As the company's Facebook page explains, the oil "has been carefully dry hopped using Simcoe and Citra late in the emulsification process by a heavily bearded and tattooed brewer, so you know it's good". We'll, uh, take your word for it. Unlock Your PC With Stack Overflow's Funky Junky Programmers are good for a laugh, as long as you don't interrupt them while they're in the coding zone. Or, as it happens, trying to log into their computer using Stack Overflow's fancy new security system "Dance Dance Authentication". No matter if you're into tango, waltz or break, you can craft your own, customised moves to lock others out of your accounts. Might get tiring if you're in IT support though. Google Pacs It Up Image: Google Google has used its maps service as a proving ground for April Fools' jokes since the beginning of time (well, electronic cartography anyway). Just hit up Google Maps, click the "Insert coin" button at the bottom-left and the roads and laneways of whatever town or city you happen to be looking at will be transformed into a game of Ms. Pac-Man, complete with ghosts, pills and cherries. Google Gnome Questions Your Existence Retro gaming isn't the only gag Google has running today. Meet the Google Gnome, the outdoor companion to the Google Home. It comes complete with weather forecasting, water hose control and a troubling love of all things Nietzsche. If you're keen to ponder the meaning of life while sorting the compost, the Gnome is the talking automation gadget for you. USB-Powered Gaming, Courtesy Of NVIDIA Image: NVIDIA 3D graphics vendor NVIDIA has concocted the world's cutest dongle — if you think tiny video cards are adorable. Plug this sucker, called the "GeForce GTX G-Assist" into your PC and it'll do anything and everything, from playing games while you're AFK, boosting your stats to defeat difficult enemies and it'll even "purchase gifts for your significant other" with its "NVIDIA Nurture" feature. Yellow Octopus' Danger Ranger: GPS And DNA, Together At Last Image: Yellow Octopus Australia is the world's deadliest continent, according to anyone who hasn't visited the country. That's if we even exist! Existential crises aside, we do have a few nasty creepy-crawlies one would prefer not to meet beside the campfire, so why not just avoid them with Yellow Octopus' "Danger Ranger". A "Dangerous Wildlife GPS Scanner", the Ranger is essentially a Star Trek-style tricorder packed with "67 DNA profiles of dangerous creatures". With its "quad helix" antenna and 16-hour battery life, you'll never have to worry about getting unintentionally romantic with a king cobra again! Which is a tricky thing to do in the first place, considering they're not native to Australia. Pets Are People Too, Says Amazon Why should humans get all the home automation fun? What if your dog wants to order snacks online? It's Amazon to the rescue with "Petlexa", the Alexa substitute that caters to the needs of your furry (or scaled) friends. I'm sure it works great, until your Labrador buries it in the backyard (or worse). The Melbourne International Comedy Festival's Manufactured Gags Robots will eventually take all our jobs, including those in creative fields. And that transition starts today. Comedy is under assault, with the first cybernetic grenade being tossed by the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. This year's event will feature the "world's first" AI comedian called LOL-BOT. Despite the fact such an invention would likely go against the MICF's best interests, it's pretty keen on the metallic joke-slinger, which uses facial recognition software and "stochastic modelling" to come up with its material. I'm guessing it also has a backup mode where it relies on Rodney Dangerfield's stuff if the crowd's a bit on the chilly side. Unlocking The Secrets Of Oat Power With Uncle Tobys Image: Uncle Tobys Looks like Allure Media's own Mark Serrels will never have to eat a spoonful of oats ever again, thanks to Uncle Tobys' "O Energy" batteries. By harnessing "the natural oat energy source" that "creates a thick oat puree which generates a superior reaction", the batteries promise clean, renewable energy for all your appliances and if you're brave enough, your stomach too. OK, so they're probably not edible, but that has more to do with the fact that they don't exist. OnePlus Enters The Energy Drink Business Image: OnePlus OnePlus has Dash Charge for its phones, but what if it could distil this technology into some sort of energy drink so one could "Dash Charge" their life? Well, taking a page from Uncle Tobys above, the smartphone company has managed this impossible feat! With customer quotes such as... "Back in my day, you were expected to get married, buy a house, and sleep for 8 hours each night. Now I see sleep was a lie created to sell sleep aids and special mattresses. Thank you, Dash. You have changed a life." ...how could you resist this specially-formulated miracle tonic? There's even a bizarre ad to go with it! Ford Australia's 'Active Thanks Assist' Tech Image: Ford Australia Apparently, being able to express emotions via your car's rear window can have a positive impact on the temperament of drivers around you, especially if you have the wheel skills of a burrito-wielding Ron Burgundy. It's surprising that it's taken this long for a car manufacturer to offer this built-in, with Ford Australia first off the rank with its "Active Thanks Assist" technology. There's also "Active Sorry Assist" for when you cut someone off, but no "Active Middle Finger Assist" when it goes the other way. Still working on that one, I suppose. National Geographic Offers Animals A Thread Of Hope Image: Harryy Whittier Frees, Library of Congress It's about time animal photographers treated their subjects with dignity. All these "natural" shots are utterly uncouth in 2017. As such, National Geographic has declared it will no longer publish "nude animal pictures". Instead, enjoy this super-cute clothed still from a simpler era, more of which can be found at Neo Geo. Netflix Live, Making The Ordinary... More Ordinary With nothing but a gravely-voiced Will Arnett and the tagline "Toasters toasting. Grass growing. Fans blowing. With Netflix Live, you can experience life's biggest thrills, right from the comfort of your couch", Netflix gave us a sneak peek at... nothing, actually. If you want to see Netflix Live, you'll have to watch it, well, live. Other than a couple of poor-quality smartphone recordings on YouTube, those without Netflix subscriptions will remain in the dark. Though I guess that's the point. The gist? Arnett narrates everyday life. eHarmony Australia Combines Physics With The Physical Image: eHarmony Good looks and charming personality not enough? eHarmony Australia has decided to take a literal approach to the attraction game by adding "magnetism" to its dating apps. The app will turn your phone into "an incredibly strong magnet" making you difficult, if not impossible, to resist. Perfect for all those single robots out there. I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream With Contiki Australia I'm starting to notice a trend with these April Fools' pranks — the elimination of humans in customer service roles. Ignoring the somewhat disturbing subtext, Contiki Australia will soon provide tours personally tailored by "Artificial Intelligence Trip Managers", or ATITA. According to Contiki, ATITA can adjust its personality to "suit each traveller" using its "data mining capabilities" to know "everything about you". I've always wanted to be stalked by my tour guide for that authentic "horror film" holiday. Now, I finally can. ING DIRECT Debuts My First Forgery Image: ING Using its patented counterfeiting technology, ING has come up with the "iTM", a phone with a built-in 3D printer than can produce "cash notes on demand". The iTM promises to eliminate "the need to use traditional ATMs" while at the same time giving your derriere a first-class ticket to the gloved hand of a federal police officer. According to ING, it's also compatible with the likes of Android Pay and Apple Pay. Committing overt felonies has never been easier! Moshi, Breaking Universal Constants Moshi is upping its accessory game by going superluminal. Forget USB Hi-Speed or SuperSpeed — why not try Moshi's Speed of Light? Going by the promotional video, USB-SL can solve every single computer problem. Heck, it can even make your notebook battery charge higher than 100 per cent. Magic? Science? Or a combination of both? Only Moshi's techno-sorcerers know the secret. Sausage Refunds For All, Thanks To ME Bank The boffins at ME Bank have been hard at work on SmellWave technology. Its first application? Cashback on all your sausage purchases. All you have to do is tap ME's Snag debit card on your barbecued meat tube and $2.50 will be deposited into your account. With careful use, you could eat free forever, if you don't mind a tiny, tiny case of atherosclerosis. Old School, Yoyo Fun With Virgin Mobile Image: Virgin Mobile We have lanyards for our glasses to stop them wandering into open toilets and other nefarious places. Can't phones have a similar convenience? While the science behind anti-gravity remains elusive, Virgin Mobile have gone with a simpler solution — the "Pho Yo". No, this isn't a clash of smartphone tech and Vietnamese cuisine, rather a the combo of yoyo and phone. Not only do you assure the safety of your mobile, but you can twirl it around while you wait for the bus. Is it a good idea? That depends on how much disposable income you have. Taste The Bicarbonate With RedBalloon Image: RedBalloon If you're always up for exciting and unique experiences, RedBalloon has some choice selections available starting from today. Bore your palate with the company's exclusive "Water Tasting Masterclass" or if you're chasing rare Pokemon, check out the Pokemon Day Tour. My personal favourite however is the Naked Paintball, if only for the gag-filled product page, which includes such witticisms as "unlimited balls" under the supplies section. Above and below body armour is also provided, which while necessary, would mostly cancel out the naked part. Deliveroo / Huxtaburger, Your Beach Burger Specialists Push bikes and motorcycles can only go so quickly, so food delivery service Deliveroo, with some help from Huxtaburger, has branched out... or should that be branched up? If you're keen from some grub and can't wait 30 minutes, Deliveroo will go to extreme lengths to get your order to you, even if it involves the expense of a parachute and plane rental. My only question: How does the poor delivery guy get back to the restaurant-post airdrop? Someone certainly isn't skipping leg day. Houzz, Blowing Up Unsightly Couches Since 2017 eBay and Gumtree? Why bother selling your old stuff when you can just blow it up? Home improvement site Houzz has supplemented its mobile app with augmented reality munitions, allowing one to simply explode unwanted furniture and unsightly trinkets. All you have to do fire up the "Hide From My Room" tool, crop the subject and tap. Try to avoid targeting your neighbour's annoying dog... or kids. Definitely keep it away from kids. The Great Reddit Experiment Image: Supplied The folks behind Reddit decided to harness the site's massive audience for a creative social experiment. If you hit up /r/place you'll find a scrollable canvas where users can place a single coloured block once every 10 minutes. It appears the delay was shorter at some point, allowing users to craft coherent images. For example, part of the image includes a picture of Wally, of Where's Wally fame. Unfortunately, in typical internet style, Wally now has his own, uh, little Wally. Cool? Move Over Glad Wrap, Try Primo Smallgoods' Bacon Wrap Image: Primo Smallgoods Bacon is the perfect complement to any meal. Sandwiches, pasta, salads, ice-cream — if you can eat it, you can eat it wrapped / sprayed / infused with bacon. Primo Smallgoods has the ideal product to make adding bacon to your diet easier, taking a page from Glad with its Bacon Wrap. Sure, it's terrible for protecting your food and will actually attract pests to your picnic, but doesn't it look scrumptious? Samurai Punk Announces Screencheat 2... For the N-Gage Image: Samurai Punk Aussie developer Samurai Punk made a name for itself with Screencheat, a split-screen competitive shooter where your opponents are invisible, forcing you to peek at other players' screens in order to win. Well, the studio has announced a sequel, exclusive to Nokia's N-Gage phone / handheld console. No idea what the N-Gage is? Best to change "is" to "was"; the gadget died a fast, horrible death many years ago. GrabOne NZ Providing Discounts On One Tree Hill's Zipline Image: GrabOne NZ Here's one for our New Zealand readers. Group deal site GrabOne NZ is offering discounted rides on the newly erected One Tree Hill zipline. According to the deal, One Tree Hill "has stood idle for too long" and thanks to AJ Hackett Bungy, are giving users the "once in a lifetime opportunity to zip over Cornwall Park as you laugh in glee at the slow-moving joggers and dog walkers below". I get the impression some interested parties thought this was an actual thing, given the massive April Fools' warning. Obviously, clicking the "Buy" button immediately takes you to a page revealing the joke. Travel Insurance Direct, Helping You Avoid Bad Tattoo Decisions Image: Travel Insurance Direct You've almost certainly heard (or sadly experienced) a tattoo horror story where that foreign-language inscription doesn't mean what its owner thinks it means. Travel Insurance Direct has you covered with its Tattoo Spell Checker app, which is great and all, except you'll want to use it before the fact, not after as illustrated in the promo picture. If you don't want to bother with the app, Google Translate should do the job just as well. Smell Like A Rabbit With Ubisoft's New Odour Image: Ubisoft Game publisher Ubisoft is getting in on the April Fools' action with its fictional scent "Viril". Anyone familiar with the company's Raving Rabbids franchise will recognise the telltale ears on the top of the bottle. Described as "a perfume for the real manly man", Viril is a "ground-breaking" eau de toilette, made by smelling "countless rabbits". Fair enough, but it's no Sex Panther. Travelodge Dreams Of Bacon Image: Travelodge And we're back to the bacon gags! Travelodge has a new "anti-snooze service" it's cooked up, called "Rise & Sizzle!", where a professional chef will break into your room with a smoking pan of freshly-fried bacon and waft it under your nose. For everyone who can't afford this personal touch, you'll have to make do with bacon-emitting alarms, courtesy of Sensorwake. Actually, Sensorwake's olfactory alarms are a real thing, though they don't appear to provide bacon as an option. Chocolate, toast and espressos yes, charred ham, no. Drop The Bass On Your Foot With Master & Dynamic Image: Master & Dynamic Your current headphones heavy on the bass? How about just heavy? Screw all those new-age materials, let's get back to basics — like, building basics — with Master & Dynamic's MH40C1 cups made entirely from concrete. Weighing 4.81kg, they're the epitome of comfort, but only if you're the bulkiest member of the Fantastic Four. Can't say how successfully they'll be with non-superheroes, but you have to experiment. As M&D CEO Jonathan Levine explains: "Master & Dynamic has consistently chosen the road less travelled. As of today, that road is paved with concrete." We'll keep updating this post with more April Fools' nonsense throughout the day.

There is some, but it's mostly inaudible. I've updated the post anyway -- hopefully we'll get more. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Why invest resources in a network entirely dedicated to travel – which most people only do on occasion — when you can use the network you invest in every day to make those same connections? The global scale of Facebook has never been more relevant than with its new City Guides. The network has doubled down on mining its data to create a painless way to plan trips. As Facebook itself pointed out in a statement to TechCrunch, the company has this rich data already: “This content already exists on Facebook, and during this test we’ll be centralizing it in a way that is more personalized and relevant to you. So, this new feature can help people get a better sense of their city, or a city they’re visiting through their friends’ eyes.” Rather than actively ask your network where you should see or where you should go, Facebook compiles relevant data into individualized City Guides. Each user will see a unique list of interesting places within a city, all curated by the user’s friends. Each of these recommendations can then be bookmarked. This simple integration of existing content into individual city pages makes it much easier (and way more fun) to plan a trip on Facebook. City Guides is a response to Google Trips. There’s no denying the value of Google’s standalone trip planning app, which helps travelers “plan less, see more” by automatically pulling trip information into an itinerary and making suggestions for activities. Yet the barrier to downloading a standalone app is high, and Facebook has the most engaged user base in the world. Now that users see recommendations straight from their networks, hospitality businesses (especially experience-based ones, like hotels) must carefully consider how to build themselves into this new travel planning flow on Facebook. Incentivizing the social share Travel businesses, especially hotels and restaurants, have benefited from social sharing since the dawn of the social media era. City Guides places yet more pressure on hospitality establishments to encourage social sharing. Since the guides pull in passive recommendations from a user’s friend, every check-in, status update or geo-tagged photo becomes a soft endorsement of the business. Definitely do not ask directly for social shares, as that can be seen as desperate — or worse, can risk violating the terms of certain platforms. Consider what you can do to make a space or experience more shareable. Is there a mural that acts as a great back-drop for photos? Is there something that can be left at the table after a meal that triggers a desire to share? Is there an iconic moment or look that can be created for your guests? It doesn’t have to be massive – it just has to be memorable. New implications for distribution Hoteliers will quickly notice that there are only four featured hotels above the fold. While it’s hard to know how valuable these organic placements are, the value could be quite high if users adopt City Guides enthusiastically. Each of these cards can be bookmarked, creating a user-defined list that could eventually be targeted through advertising. By delivering a more comprehensive view into a particular trip plan, Facebook could leverage this data for new paid distribution channels. Similar to the way that Expedia’s Scratchpad sets alerts for specific hotels and flights, Facebook could provide a quick-look resource for travelers to monitor for the best deals. These cards also link directly to a brand’s Facebook page. By encouraging more profile views from travelers in the planning phase, City Guide provides an organic lift to direct bookings via the Facebook channel. This is a promising development for hotels, who are eager to drive more direct bookings. Any business can add a call-to-action button to their Facebook page — that’s not a new development. But for those hotels who have yet to do this, City Guides is yet another reason to add a ‘Book Now’ call-to-action button. Large markets stand to gain the most This initial rollout of the new City Guides focuses exclusively on the largest markets. It’s not yet known whether the Facebook Places team will encourage a rollout to smaller markets. This means that those in the largest markets stand to gain the most. In these markets, brands that are benchmarking poorly against local competitors should look to step up their efforts on Facebook. If your brand competes in a large market, do an audit of the City Guides experience on Facebook. Is your brand delivering the most relevant information to those who visit your profile? What are your competitors doing that might be working to pull the user into a booking? Could you implement real-time customer service on Facebook, such as a Messenger bot, that would quickly answer questions of those in the planning stage? Or at the very least, be sure to have the click-to-call/click-to-chat functionality enabled and supported by customer service staff. After all, there are limited minutes in each travel planning sessions. Every minute spent with your brand is one less minute a consumer has to spend with your competition! Yet another reminder that omni-channel matters There is an abundance of marketing channels to manage. Love it or hate it, this is the way of the world. Don’t neglect one channel too much in favor of another. While there might be traction elsewhere, the balance of power can rapidly shift in digital marketing. Maintain your skill, knowledge and leverage with each of your channels so you can dial them up and down quickly, as dictated by the business. Keep at it, and understand that the nuances of how different channels feed into your funnel. Even with today’s sophisticated marketing technology, sometimes it’s not obvious exactly where a potential guest drops into the funnel. So be prepared to engage with them through whichever channel they engage with you.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Nick Vivion Nick Vivion is a writer and strategist.

What’s the incentive? This is still my question for foursquare/swarm when I hear the recent news they’ve turned the corner as an enterprise location intelligence business. Their location intelligence comes from individual people checking in — and if people stop doing that (which I believe they will), then it would seem the location intelligence would go downhill fairly quickly. What am I missing? Back to FB city guides — if consumers use them — FB’s scale is going to basically instantaneously make places featured/highlighted not “cool” anymore for locals. We’re likely a long way from that, but still something to keep in mind long term.

Here is a list of the best pranks of 2017 so far. Virgin Australia: Dog flight attendants Virgin Australia decided to prank those on Facebook with an ad showing off its new "canine flight crew members". Along with a very cute video of these dogs, Virgin Australia posted the following comment: "Today we are excited to unleash our new Virgin Australia Canine Crew in a world first initiative. On select flights, a Canine Crew member will work alongside our award-winning Cabin Crew team to offer a range of additional services. "Congratulations to all pooches who have completed their rigorous training program and officially take to the skies for the first time today." Imagine a team of dogs looking after us on flights. Honda car emojis Honda followed suit with an advertising prank. The car manufacturer has put out a commercial advertising a horn that helps you express your feelings while driving. The horn features emoji buttons that make corresponding horn sounds. So while you're cruising along, you can let the driver next know if you're happy - or possibly upset with their driving. Video Continued below. Related Content Video Watch: Canine cabin staff Tax done in 48 hours? AMP snuffs out tobacco investment Zipline for One Tree Hill Today The New Zealand Herald decided to join in the fun with Aprils Fools. If you thought a half-price deal to zipline 800m off the peak of One Tree Hill was too good to be true - well, you were right. The wild ride would apparently let tourists and thrill-seekers whizz down the side of Maungakiekie at barely-believable speeds of more than 190km/h, passing over Cornwall Park before coming to rest in a paddock, 800m from the volcano's summit. By midday today more than 3000 had clicked on the web link and more than 300 people had attempted to purchase the deal. The "new zipline" for One Tree Hill. Brendon McCullum jockey apprenticeship The TAB Trackside decided to pull a prank on their Facebook by sharing an "exclusive video" of cricketing legend Brendon McCullum announcing he will begin his jockey apprenticeship in the new season. During the video he explains how he has been "thinking about it for awhile and the time is right." When asked, "What are you doing this make this happen?" McCullum hilariously responds with, "The first thing I had to do was give up Speights, which was pretty tough." The prank didn't seem to fool many, but got at least 73 shares, 425 reactions and 289 comments. Video NZ police bunnies Waikato District Police also shared a prank on Facebook announcing their new crime fighting units - bunnies! The post explains they are "specially trained to sniff out stolen jewellery during search warrants." Apparently the operation is going well and "they really have a nose for it." Burger King Whopper toothpaste On Wednesday, the fast food chain announced the launch of the "Whopper Toothpaste" that is said to keep your mouth "Whopper fresh" all day long. The toothpaste claims to contain "active Whopper extracts" and embody "the iconic flavour of the Whopper and combine it with active ingredients for optimal teeth and gum hygiene", the company stated in a press release. Complete with full 60-second ad, Burger King has not let us down with its deadly serious movie-like trailer boasting "you won't have to hesitate between enjoying a Whopper and brushing your teeth ever again". Video Google Pac man: Google tends to do a lot of April Fools pranks every year. One includedturning Google Maps into a functional Pac Man game. It's pretty entertaining being able to able play a classic arcade game in your own street. Google maps can be converted to Pac Man. Photos / Google Google Gnome: This new device is quoted "the next evolution" from Google home. Apparently, Google Gnome is a voice-activated, hands free tools that gives you information about your back yard. A fake advertisement shows people asking the Gnome several questions from "How's the weather?" to "Can I eat this daisy?". Google Gnome can even turn your hose on and off. I think a lot of gardeners would be happy if this device really existed. Video SodaStream- NanoDrop Sodastream went the extra mile with this prank, involving Paris Hilton. This fake commercial advertises NanoDrop, "a cutting edge, state of the art condensed from of sparkling water". In other words, having one drop of this water will quench your thirst, meaning we can save planet earth by using less plastic. Paris Hilton's delivery of this advertisement is quite serious, which makes this fake ad even more hilarious. Video KFC Bucket In Canada, the fast food chain released a fake ad for a voice-activated smart device - shaped like a KFC bucket. Even though the ad doesn't say much, the futuristic vibe makes the "product" very interesting. What would the device do? Order us KFC? It's a mystery. Video Duolingo Emoji Course The language learning site has made a unique course for April Fools, teaching users the language of Emoji. This "course" comes with a flash card set to help you learn. Too bad this isn't real, this would actually be useful for adults to figure out what their teenagers are messaging each other. Would you take the Duolingo Emoji Course? Gelato that treats sensitive teeth Gelatissimo is launching the world's first artisan gelato that treats sensitive teeth. The company has worked with leading Australian dentists to create a flavour that is clinically proven to relieve the symptoms caused by tooth sensitivity. Gelatissimo launched a gelato that treats sensitive teeth. 'World's first oat powered batteries' Uncle Tobys launched 'O Energy' Oat batteries, an innovation that will transform the energy industry as the world's first renewable batteries powered entirely by oats. During a top-secret project, scientists harnessed the natural oat energy source with rigorous testing and technological enhancements. After years of analysis, scientists believe that batteries powered by oats are more powerful and long lasting than any other household battery on the market. The Uncle Toby's Oat Batteries for April Fool's Day. Deliveroo goes sky high Today, Deliveroo launched its Extreme Delivery service that engages skydivers rather than bike riders to deliver food to a broader location base. Deliveroo partnered with Melbourne-based phenomenon, Huxtaburger, delivering its mouth-watering burgers to locations off the beaten track. The tattoo spell checker app Travel Insurance Direct launched a new app, known as the 'TID: We've Got Your Back' App, a free tattoo spell checker. Ahead of tourists getting inked, the App will simply scans the artist's flash-sheet to reveal any pesky tattoo typos among English, Thai and Indonesian characters, ensuring they aren't scarred for life. The app that can tell if you're tattoo is spelt correctly. Amazon Petlexa Amazon "released" an animal feature for Amazon Alexa. This voice-activated technology allows your pets to communicate with Alexa just like we do. The Petlexa feature lets them order from Amazon and activate smart home enabled toys.

It looks like the newest addition to Google Home is an outside version called Google Gnome. As seen in the video below, this device is even more interactive, maybe even too interactive, as it gets tired of your same old mistakes and let’s you know about it! According to Android Central, the Google Gnome looks too good to be true, and the writer of the article wishes it wasn’t. While it is only an April Fools’ joke from Google, she sounds very disappointed because she wants one. The fictitious “Smart Yard” is here, or at least it’s here on a video from Google as one very creative April Fools’ joke. As seen above, the Google Gnome looks like a stream-lined version of a garden gnome without facial or body features. It sits on an outside table at a family’s home for the sake of this video and the husband and wife inundate the Google Gnome with requests. This April Fools’ joke that is done up in a video is really quite funny, as they’ve given the Google Gnome a biting edge to its answers. When the wife is told one too many times that she is making requests that can only be done with the inside version of Google Home, the Google Gnome gets an attitude. This was seen after she asked it to “add milk to her shopping list.” Google Gnome reminded her again that she is making this request to the wrong device. Google Gnome: The Smart Yard Is Finally Here. – https://t.co/jiBKscXyek pic.twitter.com/sUzmbosVZX — Scott Haner (@Techzerker) March 31, 2017 At one point they make the mistake of asking the Google Gnome which way the wind is blowing and this device continues to give answers about the wind speed and its direction. All you can hear is “south west, south, south west, south east,” over and over again as the wind shifts a little every second. This is could be annoying, but some of the things this fictitious Google Gnome is shown doing are quite cool, like “turn the hose on” or “turn the hose off.” The wife in the video is seen commanding the Google Gnome to turn the hose off, on, off, on… in an attempt to get the device to slip up and it does, but only for a second. While the family is outside they talk to the Google Gnome almost as if it is a person, and the wife even apologies to the fake device in this video. Google Gnome was not very gracious when accepting that apology. It is almost as if it reprimanded the wife for making the mistake too many times with the tone it used. April Fools’ roundup: Introducing Google Gnome. The smart yard is finally here https://t.co/yYFYuitIWY pic.twitter.com/uvHb1PyHF1 — 9to5Google (@9to5Google) March 31, 2017 For the sake of this April Fools’ joke, this Google Gnome was apparently given some type of sight. The wife tells the device to turn on the hose she is holding. The Gnome did this without asking which one it was. The same type of thing happened when the husband was holding a plastic drink cup that he just emptied. He asks the fake device if this cup should go into the compost. The Google Gnome never asked what kind of cup it is, so again it offers up a feeling that the thing can see. It really doesn’t matter because it is all fake anyway and the Google Gnome is not an item that will be offered up for sale in the stores — it’s all for the sake of April Fools’ Day. April Fools’ Day 2017: Play Ms. Pac-Man, Amazon Echo’s Petlexa, Google Gnome & more https://t.co/CeMb2rroni pic.twitter.com/cMWupgU0Mq — Biz Tips (@biz_tips) March 31, 2017 While it is meant to be an April Fools’ joke, it does give you a few moments to ponder about life when this piece of technology spews forth some words of doom. This comes after the husband in the video asks if the cup he is holding is “compost.” The Gnome sounds very serious when saying, “we are all made of organic matter and will return to organic matter,” and the camera sweeps over to their young son in the yard who looks a bit shaken by the thought of his family being compost one day. This Gnome even giggles and tells the family it tickles when the dog goes over and starts to lick it. As the video ends, the wife is on the riding mower doing the lawn. She has Google Gnome on the hood of the mower telling it to go faster, faster, faster… but the mower remains in one slow speed. Florence Ion, who wrote an article about the Google Gnome for Android Central, said “I don’t understand why this Google Gnome isn’t a real thing I can pay money for.” She would “love” to automate her backyard with a device by Google called Google Gnome. She wants to be able to ask this device how her potatoes are doing during the growing season for her backyard vegetable garden. She reports that she doesn’t think this video is funny, as it left her “devastated” when finding out the Google Gnome is not real!

The firm came under fire from the Government last year for not paying its fair share to the exchequer and opposition politicians seized on the latest tax payment as a sign that the US tech giant was still not doing enough. Google insisted it paid “all the taxes due in the UK” but as an international firm it paid the majority of its taxes in its home country. John McDonnell Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “This revelation only further proves that Philip Hammond and Theresa May are more interested in cutting Google’s taxes, than making sure they are paying their fair share. “It seems that the so called ‘successful’ tax deal with Google that George Osborne boasted about last year has meant that they are still not paying their fair share under his successor Philip Hammond. We urgently need clarity on HMRC’s relationship with Google and what reassurances have been provided to the company.— John McDonnell MP (@johnmcdonnellMP) March 31, 2017 “It is a national disgrace that by paying just £36 million in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country. And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory Government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year’s scandal.” .@johnmcdonnellMP responds to news of Google’s tax bill only amounting to just £36.4 million https://t.co/w0Wm29ufDS— Labour Press Team (@labourpress) March 31, 2017 Liberal Democrat treasury spokeswoman Baroness Kramer said: “It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes. Our worst fear is that the Tories would use Brexit to turn the UK into a tax haven sitting off the northern shores of Europe, there is no sign that this isn’t where we are headed. “This Government is already struggling with the Brexit squeeze, if they want to stop cutting vital services they need to start picking up what is owed to the British people.” Baroness Kramer (Gareth Fuller/PA) Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the influential Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said: “Yet again we see a large corporation paying a rate of tax that belies its significant presence and business transactions in the UK. “This is why the PAC is working internationally to press for greater tax transparency so that we can all see clearly how much tax corporations pay and where.” Meg Hillier (PA) The firm revealed it paid £36.4 million in UK corporation tax on pre-tax profits of £148.8 million in the year to June 30 2016. A Google spokesman said: “As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff.” The tech company paid £46.2 million in corporation tax for the previous 18 months to June 30 2015. That covered an extra six months of business before Google moved to a 12-month accounting period the following year. Google said both administrative costs and turnover for the period decreased as a result of the accounting changes. Revenue dropped £141 million in the year to June 30 2016 to £1 billion, from just under £1.2 billion for the previous 18 months.

Users can chomp their way through city streets by opening the Google Maps app on their phone or on their computer by going to maps.google.com. Just tap or click on the Ms. Pac-Man icon, and the map is transformed into a virtual arcade game. Some users have reported that clicking the icon takes you to a random location to play the game. Others have reported that they have been able to pick their location. Users who sign in can save their score and share it with friends.

The firm came under fire from the Government last year for not paying its fair share to the exchequer and opposition politicians seized on the latest tax payment as a sign that the US tech giant was still not doing enough. Google insisted it paid "all the taxes due in the UK" but as an international firm it paid the majority of its taxes in its home country. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "This revelation only further proves that Philip Hammond and Theresa May are more interested in cutting Google's taxes, than making sure they are paying their fair share. "It seems that the so called 'successful' tax deal with Google that George Osborne boasted about last year has meant that they are still not paying their fair share under his successor Philip Hammond. "We urgently need clarity on HM Revenue and Customs' relationship with Google and what reassurances have been provided to the company. "It is a national disgrace that by paying just £36 million in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country. And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory Government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year's scandal." Liberal Democrat treasury spokeswoman Baroness Kramer said: "It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes. "Our worst fear is that the Tories would use Brexit to turn the UK into a tax haven sitting off the northern shores of Europe, there is no sign that this isn't where we are headed. "This Government is already struggling with the Brexit squeeze, if they want to stop cutting vital services they need to start picking up what is owed to the British people." Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the influential Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said: "Yet again we see a large corporation paying a rate of tax that belies its significant presence and business transactions in the UK. "This is why the PAC is working internationally to press for greater tax transparency so that we can all see clearly how much tax corporations pay and where. "There is already strong international support and growing collaboration for changing the way tax is reported by multinationals. "This latest tax contribution from Google just underlines why this is so important." The firm revealed it paid £36.4 million in UK corporation tax on pre-tax profits of £148.8 million in the year to June 30 2016. A Google spokesman said: "As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. "We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff." The tech company paid £46.2 million in corporation tax for the previous 18 months to June 30 2015. That covered an extra six months of business before Google moved to a 12-month accounting period the following year.  Google said both administrative costs and turnover for the period decreased as a result of the accounting changes. Revenue dropped £141 million in the year to June 30 2016 to £1 billion, from just under £1.2 billion for the previous 18 months.  The company has faced mounting pressure over its tax affairs amid a backlash against corporate tax avoidance by multi-national companies. Google agreed to a controversial £130 million deal with HM Revenue & Customs in January last year to settle a 10-year tax inquiry into its UK business. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) declined to comment on Google's tax payment, saying it did not discuss identifiable taxpayers.  A spokesman said: "Everyone has to pay the tax due under the law and we do not settle for less. "Our most recent figures show that HMRC brought in a record £26 billion in extra tax for our public services, with £7.3 billion of that total coming from the 2,100 largest and most complex businesses in the UK."   31 March 2017 10:00PM View comments Most Commented Win a £1,000 garden makeover with Quattro Products and the News & Star 18 Keith Curle: Remaining games will show who is fit to stay at Carlisle Utd 5 Shaun Miller sent off as Carlisle Utd flop at home to Crewe 4 Work set to start on controversial castle crossing in Carlisle 4 'Kind, passionate & a hunger for life' - tributes to Carlisle biker killed in crash 3 Most Read One dead and two hurt following crash near Carlisle Strictly Come Dancing star Anton Du Beke announces birth of twins Tributes after sudden death of young Cumbrian rugby player Congealed food, unwashed residents, staff in tears - shock Carlisle home report 'Kind, passionate & a hunger for life' - tributes to Carlisle biker killed in crash More news   Roxie Fawn The new rules make it illegal for under-18s to buy tobacco and nicotine vapour products, known as NVPs or e-cigarettes E-cigarette restrictions coming into force in Scotland The body was reportedly found by a dog walker on Murlough beach in Newcastle, Co Down Probe as man's body found on beach A girl's mother at the centre of a family court dispute made a number of complaints at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London Judge 'irritated' during 'tortuous' dispute over two-year-old girl, hearing told The Prince of Wales meets religious leaders during a walking tour of the Old Town in Bucharest Charles to honour First World War dead during Italy visit Quick searches Carlisle Airport Carlisle United Court cases Cumberland Infirmary Sellafield West Cumberland Hospital Featured articles   New £1 coin Photo: Martin Keene/PA Wire There's a new quid on the block: everything you need to know about the new £1 coin Don't get caught out with new mobile phone laws: find out the dos and don'ts JOBS PROPERTY MOTORS LOCAL BUSINESSES READER TRAVEL BUY PHOTOS PLACE AN AD DATING Contact Us News & Star Newspaper House, Dalston Road Carlisle, Cumbria CA2 5UA 01228 612600 Contact us online here Facebook Twitter YouTube Sitemap Home | News | Carlisle Utd | Sport | Motors | Property | Jobs | Contact Us | Lifestyle | Family Notices | Buy photos | Place an ad | Buy and Sell | Readers Travel | Subscriptions | Business Directory | Dating | Pets in Cumbria Services Subscriptions | Jobs | Property | Motors | Travel | Dating | Family Notices | Pets CN Group News & Star | Cumberland News | Times & Star | Whitehaven News | Hexham Courant | NW Evening Mail | Eskdale & Liddesdale Advertiser | Cumbria Life | Carlisle Living | Dumfries and Galloway Life | in-cumbria | The Bay | Lakeland Radio | Cumbria Live | Choose Cumbria | CN-Jobs | clickin2 | Business directory | Reader holidays | CN Group | Privacy policy © 2017 CN Group back to top

Microsoft Word vs. Google Docs: Which works better for business? Video Inside Google's Loon and Wing It is April 1, which means pranks abound all over the interwebs. We here at Computerworld are taking one for the team, doing the hard work of researching the best pranks around so that we can share them with you. It is a thankless job, but somebody's gotta do it.  Everyone is getting in on the fun this year -- so many that we couldn't possibly include them all. But the ones that made the cut are sure to make you laugh.  So pull up a seat and put down your coffee -- because if you don't, you are bound to spray a mouthful all over your computer screen.  Google Gnome Google Home has made our homes smart, but our yards have remained decidedly un-smart. No longer -- with Google Gnome, your home's outside can be just as smart as its inside.  Google Gnome will help with all your outdoor needs, from telling you the weather and the direction of the wind to turning your garden hose on and off. Just make sure you remember to only ask Google Gnome outside requests, don't let the dog lick it (it tickles), and try not to send it into an existential crisis with deep questions. T-Mobile Onesie T-Mobile is known for pushing the envelope when it comes to wireless coverage, but the company is stepping up its game this year with its first ever wearable: the T-Mobile Onesie.  Previous wearables were limited in what they could track. How could a watch possible monitor your entire body? The Onesie solves that problem, tracking everything from your heart rate to your bladder level.  The Onesie, which comes in different designs, such as sports, comfort and work, was created by weaving 4G LTE nanofibers into the Onesie, covering the wearer in the network, so that the user can act as a human hotspot. Not to mention, it is so @#$%ing comfortable.  T-Mobile CEO John Legere, the self-described "genius visionary" behind the Onesie, describes how the Onesie combines his love of wireless technology, fitness and magenta fashion. It is cyber meets Versace. Netflix Live Live video is all the rage, and Netflix is getting in on the game with Netflix Live. The new service gives Netflix users what they have always wanted -- a live stream of Will Arnett giving a stream of consciousness commentary on the video you are watching. (Sign in to Netflix and search for Netflix Live for an example.)  So you want to know what watching Netflix Live is like? During a video of a microwave, Will Arnett is saying, "I'm trying to read what it says on the top of the microwave there. I think it says..."microwave." I need an eye check. I've always thought that the only reason I didn't become a jet fighter is because of my eyesight." It doesn't get much better than that.  Progressive Red Planet Protection Humans living on Mars is no longer a questions of if -- it is a question of when. So shouldn't we all be prepared for the inevitable? That is where insurance company Progressive comes in. Its new offering, the Red Planet Protection plan, will make sure you are ready for whatever comes your way when you are living off-planet. You can get protection for your jetpacks, rovers, aircrafts and more. And don't forget -- alien theft is real, and you need coverage that will stay with you, even if you are 140 million miles from home. Progressive Google Wind The Netherlands is a great country to live in, but it has one big downside -- the rain. In the Netherlands, it rains 145 days a year. But thanks to the Google Cloud Platform, that will not be a problem for long. Google is harnessing the power of Holland's 1170 windmills and is using them not to capture the wind, but to create it. The company used the Google Cloud Platform to understand how, well, clouds behave, and then used machine learning to get all the windmills to work together.  Not only can Google push the clouds away, guaranteeing clear skies in the Netherlands, the company can manipulate clouds to make it rain, when needed, in certain areas. One note: you just may want to eat inside from now on.  Lexus Lane Valet We've all been there: Cruising along in our luxury car in the left lane of traffic, looking damn good, when we get stuck behind what is undoubtedly not a luxury car, driven by someone not nearly as attractive as we are, going entirely too slowly to be in the fast lane. Total downer, right. Now Lexus has come out with a new feature that will take care of the problem. With the push of a button, Lane Valet will detect the vehicle ahead that is cramping your style and initiate semiautonomous control over the car, connecting to its onboard systems. It will then scan the adjacent lane for traffic, moving the car over if it finds none. You can then cruise on, unobstructed.  iFixit Micro Tech Toolkit Technology components are getting smaller and smaller, but the tools we use to fix them haven't been, which is clearly a big oversight by the tool-making community. But iFixit is changing that, with the new Micro Tech Toolkit.  The toolkit comes with a magnetized driver handle, an easy-to-open tool roll, micro pliers, a micro spudger, a micro opening tool, and three precision bits. Best of all, everything is tiny, perfect for tiny repairs, and the whole thing will fit easily into your current toolbox. At $19.95, this is a must have. Roku SnackSuggest Nothing goes better together than a show and a snack. But sometimes, we just don't know what pairs perfectly with Stranger Things, or what will best complement Breaking Bad.  Roku is aiming to take uncertainty out of the equation with its new feature, Roku SnackSuggest. After streamers set their taste preferences and alert Roku of any dietary restrictions, the streaming service will always know what goes best with a binge session of Game of Thrones (mutton, chicken wings and ale, for the record). Happy streaming! Roku Lyft Mono Ride-hailing service Lyft has made it so you can request a car with just a few taps on your phone. But in today's world, is that really easy enough? Short answer: No. That is why Lyft has come out with Mono, an autonomous ride-hailing glove of sorts that lets you request a Lyft by simply raising your hand, similar to how people hitched a ride back in the olden days.  Amazon Echo Petlexa Amazon Echo has made it so that every person in your house can interact with technology, but up until now it has been overlooking one important part of the family: your pets. No more. Thanks to Petlexa, your pets can now interact with your Amazon Echo just as easily as you can. Alexa will track your hamster's steps, order sushi for your cat and activate your dogs automatic ball launcher.  All it takes is a squeak, a meow or a bark.  Google Maps Pac-Man Getting directions these days is just so ordinary. You put in your destination, Google Maps tells you how to get there. It gets the job done, but there is no excitement in the process. Well, now there is, with the introduction of Ms. Pac-Man into Google Maps. Now, when you open the app, you are greeted with a circular Ms. Pac-Man icon above the "Go" and "Location" icons you normally see. Press it, and Maps brings you to an entirely new location and turns into a Ms. Pac-Man game. So go ahead and play -- you never know where you'll end up.  Rebecca Linke/IDG Duolingo Emoji language course Many of out texting apps now automatically suggest an emoji when you type in certain words, but who among us is truly fluent in emoji? Not enough of us, that is for sure. So Duolingo, a company that creates software to help you learn new languages, has taken matters into its own hands, with its new Emoji language course. According to Duolingo, Emoji is spoken by more than 2 billion millennials around the world, but few others are fluent. In an effort to preserve their native tongue, volunteers fluent in Emoji have created the Duolingo course for free.  “People 💙 to 💩 on emojis, but in a relatively short 🕐, they’ve far eclipsed their precursor, Egyptian hieroglyphics, and set the 🌎 standard of 📱 among millennials 💅,” said Yuna Kode, one of the selftaught Emoji experts behind the course. So what are you waiting for? Start to learn Emoji today.  Duolingo Honda Horn Emoji Do you sometimes feel like you just can't convey the appropriate emotions through your car horn? It is a shortcoming in our cars that we have put up with for far too long. Now, thanks to Honda, we can fully express ourselves through our car horn with Honda Horn Emojis. This driver-to-driver communication system gives you a myriad of expressive horn sounds to choose from. The smiling emoji gives a happy Honk, while the annoyed face emoji lets you commiserate with other drivers stuck in traffic. The Honda Horn Emoji is helping build today's tomorrow, today. Haptic Helpers VR and AR experiences have nearly mastered the visual and audio simulations, but leave taste, touch and smell out of the equation. Well, Google aims to put and end to that, and their solution, Haptic Helpers, will revolutionize VR and AR experiences.  Google has found that the best way to enhance a VR or AR simulation is by sending actual people to help you out. Trying to smell a flower? Haptic Helpers will hold one under your nose. Want to feel like you are sitting in front of a fire? Haptic Helpers will shine a heat lamp on you. And if you want to try out Haptic Helper yourself? Well, you can sign up as a beta tester.  Dash Energy Humans do a lot of different things to give us energy. But sometimes coffee and eating right just aren't enough, and we need a little extra boost.  Enter Dash Energy, based on OnePlus' Dash Charge technology, which gives your gadgets power in a flash. OnePlus is applying that fast charging technology to the human body, so that we have unlimited energy and never have to sleep again. Dash Charge your life.  Hulu Hu Everyone is busy these days, so who has time to watch an entire TV show? That is why Hulu has come out with Hu, which abbreviates your shows into digestible eight-second segments. You'll be able to discuss the latest episodes of your favorite show at the water cooler, putting in only the minimum amount of time required to stay up-to-date. Hulu Prysm Avatar Businesses today are spread across the world, and you can't always be at a meeting in London when your office is in San Francisco. But Prysm's new tech will help you connect with your colleagues, no matter where they are. With Prysm Avatar, a drone equipped with a holographic projector will display your likeness in life size, so that you can collaborate with your co-workers from afar. Use the accompanying app to send your avatar to meetings, walk with colleagues in the halls, and even change your avatar's clothes. The drone is also integrated with Synapse 2.0 so that you can control your avatar with your mind. Quilted Northern uSit Wearables monitor our heart rate, blood pressure, the distance we have run and a slew of other movements. But Quilted Northern has come out with a wearable device that measures an entirely different kind of movement.  uSit is a biometric bathroom tracker that lets you record all your toileting data, including frequency and duration. It also lets you share your sits with friends, set personalized sitting goals, and gives you badges for longest sits, speediest sits and outdoor sits.  You can defend your throne with battle sits, and get motivated with a go coach for tough sits. Like all good wearables, uSit syncs across all your devices. It is also available for the littlest sitters in your life in a uSit mini model.     To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Google today made a couple of April Fools’ Day jokes. The first is Google Gnome, an assistant that lives in your yard and helps with outdoor (and only outdoor) tasks. For example, the Gnome can turn your hose on and off or tell you which direction the wind is blowing. You can see a video starring Google Gnome above, and Google even went so far as to create a special page for Gnome on its online store. Google’s other gag today is Ms. Pac-Maps, which lets you play Ms. Pac-Man using Google Maps on Android, iOS, and the desktop.

This is a smart product for smart people, with Google announcing that the arrival of Google Gnome means that, “The smart yard is finally here”. Given how useful Google Gnome could prove to be, you’d be a fool not to buy one. Google Home is a smart home device Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor In this article, you'll learn the differences between the Amazon Echo and Google Home. We'll also take a look at what features an Apple speaker may include. Read More which pretty much does it all. It can control your other smart devices, play music, answer questions, and sit in silence listening to you talk about the crappy day you’ve had at work. But what happens when you head out into your yard to catch some sun? Google Gnome takes over, that’s what… Google Home Cosplays As a Gnome Google Gnome is Google’s latest smart home device, and it’s essentially Google Home cosplaying as a gnome. While Google Home manages all of the indoor stuff, Google Gnome handles the outdoors shiz. That means checking the weather, telling you what plants not to eat, and musing on the fragility of life (see video below). If philosophical discussions aren’t your thing, not to worry, as Google Gnome is capable of doing plenty of other things. The examples Google gives include playing fetch with the dog, mowing the lawn while you put your feet up, and telling you when to stop and smell the roses. If you have the money and inclination you can even buy some accessories for your Google Gnome. These include wet weather gear, a bird bath attachment, a camp chair, and a smaller Google Gnome in case your original one gets lonely. Because everyone needs a friend. You’d Be a Fool Not to Buy One In case you hadn’t guessed already, Google Gnome isn’t real. It is, instead, one of Google’s famous April Fools’ Day jokes. Google is using this one to promote Google Home, a genuine smart home device we recommended in our review Google Home Review and Giveaway Google Home Review and Giveaway Google Home is a personal assistant smart speaker, and comes from a company that literally knows everything. The $130 Google device answers questions, controls your smart home, and plays music. Should you buy one? Read More . But I kinda prefer the Gnome, if I’m honest. What do you think of Google Gnome? Would you like one in your garden? Do you wish this was an actual product? Or are you glad it’s a joke? What do you think of April Fools’ Day? Do you appreciate the effort Google puts into its gags?

Anthony Levandowski, an Uber executive whom CEO Travis Kalanick once called his "brother from another mother," is asserting his Fifth Amendment rights in a lawsuit filed by his former employer, Google. Levandowski's lawyers say he's invoking the right to avoid self-incrimination because there's "potential for criminal action" in the case, according to court transcripts obtained by the New York Times, news that adds another dimension to a mounting legal battle that could rage into a full-on war. Levandowski's former employer, Google, brought suit against Uber in late February, alleging that Levandowski and others stole self-driving secrets from them. It was this autonomous technology, created at Google/Alphabet-owned driverless car company Waymo, which Levandowski used to launch his self-driving truck company, Otto, or so Google's lawyers assert. Otto was quickly acquired for $680 million by Uber — along with its autonomous technology innovations, which gave the ride-hailing company a much needed speed-boost in the race to develop and deploy self-driving cars. As part of a motion Google filed seeking a temporary injunction against Uber's autonomous vehicle development, Google demanded that Uber hand over 14,000 files he allegedly downloaded on his way out of Google and brought with him to Uber. Levandowski has said he downloaded the files to work from home with them. The transcript of a private hearing before a US District Court judge in San Francisco obtained by the Times reveals that Levandowski's lawyers said he wouldn't turn over the files, an aspect of his Fifth Amendment rights, they said. An Uber lawyer representing Levandowski said the exec's rights protect against “compelled disclosure that would identify the existence, location or possession of any responsive documents.” That wasn't doing it for the judge, William Alsup: "If you think for a moment that I'm going to stay my hand, because your guy is taking the Fifth Amendment, and not issue a preliminary injunction to shut down what happened here, you’re wrong," Alsup said according to Bloomberg, who also obtained the transcript. According to the Times, Alsup pointed out to Uber that the company had the right to force Levandowski to speak on the matter and turn over the files — by ordering him to do so, or be fired from the company. In a statement, Angela Padilla, Uber's associate general counsel, projected assuredness. "We look forward to our first public response laying out our case on Friday, April 7," she said according to Bloomberg. "We are very confident that Waymo’s claims against Uber are baseless and that Anthony Levandowski has not used any files from Google in his work with Otto or Uber."

[Update: Notification Channels] Android O feature spotlight: Android tells you if an app is displaying a screen overlay 2017/03/31 12:05pm PDTMar 31, 2017 View All 35 Articles In This Series Android O was revealed last week, and Google talked about the neat stuff it can do via blog posts and videos. We didn't get all the little details—those nice touches that make you smile, realizing Google takes design seriously these days. Case in point, there's a rad new animation when you open and close the notification shade. Let's watch, shall we? The above video is shown at normal speed. Notice how the icons are in that bottom strip as you open the shade. Then, they slide up as the notification they are connected to is revealed. That's cool, but it looks even cooler in slow motion.   In the above video, that same animation is playing out at one-tenth speed (this is also the case for the GIF up top).  The icons sort of float across the screen to take up their position. When you close the notifications, the icons slip back down and line up. This looks a bit like a shrunken down version of the quick settings close animation. It won't fundamentally alter the experience on Android O, but it's still cool. Tags android o animations feature spotlight series_android_o_feature_spotlights video subscribe ...

You know, Nexus devices never really die... Latheryin You are missing the fact that all of Google latest code is 64 bit and the nexus 6 is 32 bit so the code is not really portable. Bewear Oh, you are right. Well, I certainly expect that some effort will be made by communities, like with ARMv6 devices. Latheryin I have spoken with many and as they are old school they know what it will entail and they have already said they are not even bothering. Many even changed devices off of the nexus 6 to the 6p because it is 64 bit. Bewear It seems I will have to jump ship soon, then, since my device is 32 bit too. Twitler What are you ? a sheap ? Don't change a Nexus at least 3-4 years.Not worth the upgrade since commnunity will take care of Nexus line better than Google ever did. Bewear The only Nexus I actually own is the Nexus 4, so I know how they can be kept alive, though it's not my main device anymore. My current device is the Moto MAXX, which is quite similar to the Nexus 6. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Rather looks like some animation glitch Martin I thought so too in the slow motion version, but thought it looked better at normal speed. Justin DiOrio Ya. Watch an actual phone video on youtube. Looks good. Dont have to pull all the way down to see what apps notified u. If u want to see what they say u scroll down and lil images r removed 1 by 1. Nd it works in reverse 2. So nice!!! SHunter That or Hangouts... Zsolt V Yes, and they should reassign all janitors and cafeteria workers to help out with the effort, too. P.s. I thought an inane comment like this would have been the top one. Surprised it's only #3. Suicide_Note Amazing. Maxr1998 Noticed it immediately after updating, made me smile ;) Love the attention to detail that Google is showing here! MicroNix All it does is add extra work for the SOC m477 Yeah, they should ditch the GUI altogether. Everything more than a command line is waste of resources. Ryan Idiotic argument by an idiot. A little detail that nobody but a nerd is going to notice /= the entire UI. m477 Many details that "nobody but a nerd is going to notice" make a nice and polished UI. If you consider them useless waste of resources, you can turn off animations from developer settings. Nicholas Conrad Zomg, how about putting dev resources to anything else? Kehnin Dyer ui guys are BORED Nick Coad I think commenters here frequently seem to have a strange view of how software gets developed. Like people seem to think that you have 20 devs (for example) and they sit and work 100% on a single animation for four days or something. There are so many things wrong with that. Leonardo Baez This.. My god, how people can be so limited in their vision? Henry Park Because a lot of people don't know how developing software works let alone taken a programming class Leonardo Baez It's​ just common sense... Most people seems to dont have it. Henry Park fact that most people seem to not know implies it is not common sense to average human being. Ryan Umm, you dont have to be a code expert to know resource planning. Even if its ONE dev spending 3 logged hours on this its 3 logged hours that could have been spent actually making something useful or fixing a bug. And wait, theres more! Lets assume there are all kinds of pointless animations and eggs that are in O that will likely eventually be nixed because they are pointless, if everyone just diverted all of their time from that to something useful imagine what could be done! AndroidUser00110001 Different kind of coders... NothingUnknown It was either this or another messaging app. Take your pick. PVL_93_RU Looks kinda iffy, like the icons lag behind the shade Leonardo Baez 1/10th of real speed on the videos... In real speed you will not even notice Peter Leung I didn't notice this. I used android o for a week. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I have the new Pixel Launcher on my 6p and the "bounce" animation the Icons in these videos show, happens to the app drawer shade when I unlock the phone. Not sure how long that's been there but I just noticed it. Almost like it's saying "Hey, you can swipe up here" Abhishek Das https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/442cfb7a3fd2ab0deba7f11a64708d1a81c49b54f98d7b2e82ca4673541370df.jpg 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d854815208e8ebd194c840a407251882b40ee69f742aa280a190fa9353c47ebe.png m477 Please stop. Avishek Stahp Konrad Krawczuk I hope its some kind of animation glitch. Looks absolutely awful. Minimalism is the key... Miguel Angel No! It's time to have overly complicated animations once again. Our phones are powerful enough. We have the technology ! Vivek Rameses Yeah, that is god awful. Probably a bug. Latheryin So this is what they work on while the OS has tons of issues that are far more pressing. Way to go Google. With how pointless it is there is no mistaking it came from the Google design team that I and many others are confident are pretty much blind. So yeah makes sense. Nick Coad I don't get your complaint, do you think the same people who fix low level OS bugs are working on UI animations? Is that what you actually believe? Latheryin I Believe in team work. If one fails they all fail. And the UI people have their own epic fails as of late. Nick Coad I don't understand how that's relevant to what you posted. You seem to think that this animation somehow means the OS issues are being ignored, but in reality those things are developed by different groups of people. It's like people think that they have a list of tasks and they set the entire team on each task one after the other. That's just not how it works, they will be simultaneously working on lots of shit at once across the whole team. Latheryin And it goes to show how bad that fails. Too many cooks in kitchen. They are being ignored. Just look at the shut down issue for all nexus and pixel devices after 7.0. You must never have worked on a multi-team project. Had you, then you would know that it doesn't matter what team fails. If one does the whole project fails. mchalakov I'm interested in the fails that the "UI people" did recently? Latheryin Quick tiles (waste of space) material design (text book juvenile colors) tool bars at the top of the device when they are only getting bigger. Should I keep going. Matthew Gardner That's an amazing non-response you just gave. Ever considered a career in politics? Latheryin Politics? No thanks. I have self honor. So not an option. It was an answer. It doesn't matter what part of the project fails. Give them a by because it wasn't there team is the same as a participating trophy. Both are BS. Martin Of course, how else would it work? On an unrelated note, I yelled at a gardener today. What the heck is he doing planting flowers, when he could be out fighting crime?! Ryan Leadership pays them. Hire one less "notification shade animation dev" and one more "fixing broken shit" dev. Its like a baker that never has enough of one type of cookie but tons of another type of cookie. This problem was always solvable, you just needed to plan for it. Nick Coad They need to slow down the speed just a tiny amount, but other than that it's a great effect. Filipe Santos Okay, now stop Google, it's too much dblock Anyone else think this doesn't look clean at all? Something about the icon beginning beneath the notification text just doesn't look good to me. Lord Argyris It's interesting how the overshoot the icons do when sliding into position isn't obvious until you see it in slow motion. I imagine if they didn't do that, the animation would look unnatural, with the icons seemingly "sticking" upon ending up in their respective notifications. A real object that moved like that and landed somewhere would bounce a bit, and so do these icons. Attention to detail--that was what Material Design was all about before we started chasing after circular icon windmills and endless UI churn. Ploppy Why would you animate something on top of something else... Nick Coad I don't even know how to respond to this. Ploppy I don't know ANY product that animates small elements with transparent background. Do you? Ploppy Usually you animate either something big, such as an entire window, or something alone in a container. You never animate small elements with random shapes and transparent background over some text. Ploppy It was 2am I should have write this differently lol. ericshmerick Gimmick gonna get old quick. Naxx ENVY kinda like this comment BBpost Did they finally fix the issue where you get a notification beep about archiving a gmail or dismissing an exchange notification? It's really annoying when you clear out a dozen notifications and then get 12 instant notification beeps for notifications that instantly disappear. mchalakov Don't put too much thinking in this. It's just a simple animation to make someone(who notice it) smile. You know easter egg style ;) Willie Chalmers III I'm a bit indifferent to the animation change. I like the fact it's there, but maybe it's more suited to being a fade in of some kind. This doesn't feel too much like material design. Burak Çalık Its actually very good, but slow-motion view makes it look bad. mattcoz Agreed, looks terrible because the icon moves over the text. Luckily at full speed that isn't noticeable. instinct I think the opposite. We should argue about this. Ramon Add more lag to the OS. Real nice Google. Optimize more first. MeCampbell30 Looks better in slow motion to me. Looks kinda janky at regular speed. instinct I thought the same thing, It's too fast where it almost just seems to appear as if it took time to load. Fernando Pena I would never notice that if it wasn't for this post. That animation is SO FAST. I can barely see it... Mr. Spock It looks more like a bug than a feature. brolivar I could watch this all day DragoCubed It looks so good in slow motion but in real time it's simply too fast. Tahir firoz Wow 217 applications updated klaus muster ApK teardown please Car Parking Car Parking Driving Simulator is a fantastic game!

It looks like a childs idea. Just because you can animate it, doesn't mean you should. Cakefish I like! Fitzelgard Allan Gerard Dearest Google, Slower, you slut. thunderqus I hate it that icons are so colourful when tray is pulled but not in tray itself. wallace This will requires a new GPU tweak ... an easy way to drop more than half of existing smartphones. Ryan There are hundreds of bug reports, probably two dozen in bluetooth alone and THIS is what they spend resources on? hoooooookkkkaaayyy create812 It's been said that, while Android looks better in screenshots, iOS looks better in motion. I'm glad Android team is focusing on some more movement animations. This one needs some tuning, but I'm a fan already. Sean Thomas fun fact animation designers aren't going to be fixing bugs. They can work on more than one thing at a time. This looks great. It definitely makes the notification shade feel more connected to the rest of android. IDK what people are talking about with the whole "looking like a glitch" thing. Chris As long as I can turn it off to save battery life Fernando Pena You can always turn off animations. blindexecutioner That will be nice eye candy for all the persistent notifications that are probably going to be forced on us. It will probably stutter all the time though. Nothing ever turns out that smooth in Android. BC I'm in love with this little touches and it makes me happy that Android O is going to focus on that...I am sad as most major OEMs won't update to this version quickly enough to make my excitement peak. poop. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f0e5837bf0818abfa0fd3ba8b7123b80d5c20c448cc919e68f9864ecc8df61c6.jpg Preben Nielsen I would choose ... not to have it. I like the icons coming and going at the bottom but not the icons slowly floating to their notofocation.

So, as is tradition, we’ve rounded up the best goofs, gags, and gimmicks from around the web as we enjoy the antics of the various internet companies. And remember — if you see something tomorrow (or today, even though it’s still not even April Fools’ yet!) that sounds a little bizarre, strange, or too good to be true, it might be worth a second glance. We’ll continue to keep this list updated through the day(s) as more clever (or “clever”) jokes emerge. Google Image by Natt Garun / The Verge Google tends to have a ton of (oddly functional) April Fools’ jokes, so for the sake of this list, I’m only including one for now. The rest can be found on their own dedicated roundup, so that other companies can get a chance to be included. Of all Google’s pranks this year, the conversion of Google Maps into a functional game of Ms. Pac-Man is probably the best of them, if only because Ms. Pac-Man is a fantastic game. That said, Google did do this exact same thing with regular Pac-Man two years ago, so it’s possible the company might be running out of ideas. T-Mobile Name a more iconic duo pic.twitter.com/eq3qbGW04f— Andrew J. Hawkins (@andyjayhawk) March 31, 2017 T-Mobile’s April Fools’ joke was the T-Mobile ONEsie — because its latest plan is called T-Mobile One and onesies allow for a semi-clever portmanteau and okay you get it. The company claims that the Onesie is a full-body wearable packed with a variety of dubious tech, including thermal charging, nanofibers, and fitness tracking, which is obviously nonsense. I’m also deducting points for the entire concept, since Microsoft beat them to the One / onesie joke by a couple of months. Still, T-Mobile is actually selling the things for $40 each (sans-fictional tech, of course), should a bright magenta T-Mobile onesie be something you desire in your life. Hulu Hulu’s April Fools’ gimmick is an alleged new service called “Hu,” which promises “TV abbreviated” by cutting down shows to just eight seconds to better match people’s shortened attention spans. To that end, the company has actually put together several playlists on both its own site and YouTube (for non-subscribers) of dramatically shortened episodes of Seinfeld, Black Sails, The Mindy Project, Empire, and others to show off the idea. Master & Dynamic Master & Dynamic is best known for it’s premium metal and leather headphones, and for its bit of April humor the company teased a pair of its MH40 Wireless On-Ear model made entirely out of concrete. Weighing in at a purported 10.6 pounds, the concrete cans are probably infeasible for, you know, wearing. Also, like everything else on this list, they’re not real. Lyft Lyft made a very weird decision this April Fools’ Day by announcing a wacky, Power Glove style gadget to summon rides by raising your hand in the air, but also made them actual, real devices that are fully functional? So, not sure this is actually a “prank,” per-say. For more info, see my colleague Andrew Hawkins, who tried it out for himself. Netflix Netflix’s marking of the day took the form of “Netflix Live,” a remarkably peaceful video of Will Arnett narrating ordinary objects. Is it a joke? Deeper satire on live video trends? Who can say. Fellow Verge reporter Megan Farokhmanesh has the full details if you’d like to know more. Reddit Reddit’s April Fools’ joke is less of a joke and more of a giant social experiment, similar to last year’s The Button. This year’s project, titled Place, is a large while pixel grid that each user can place a colored pixel on every five minutes. Reddit being Reddit, the grid has quickly been overtaken by a number of semi-religious cults and several crudely drawn images of genitalia, as the site’s community once again illustrates why we can’t have nice things. Duolingo The language learning site has made a special course for April Fools’, teaching not German or Spanish but Emoji, which might be helpful for adults trying to understand teens. And there actually is a flash card set to help you learn, so that’s something. Amazon Amazon has an Alexa-themed joke for the day, with a new “Petlexa” integration, that purports to make your Echo capable of understanding queries from your pets. It mostly just consists of this video, since Amazon (understandably) didn’t build a functional version of this. (Dis-)Honorable Mentions Not every joke is a winner. But we’ve collected a few that didn’t quite make the cut here anyway as a service to you, our dear readers, in case you’d like to verify that for yourselves. The Triwa YNGVE DIY watch, which is modeled off Ikea and irritatingly not real. Yo, the world’s most useless social media app, rose from the grave with a spark of wit to “announce” a mock “Yo Stories” feature. Roku SnackSuggest, a mock Roku channel that suggests food to go with your content. iFixit, with a fake Micro Tech Toolkit featuring even smaller tools for opening up your even smaller gadgets. The Harambed — “the bed of your memes” — from Lucid Mattress. Stop. Just stop.

Google, in particular, is known for rolling out a ton of different pranks. Most of them are actually pretty fun since they are localized to each Google product or regional team. Here’s a look at what we’ve found out there this year. Pac-Maps The ability to play Pac-Man on Google Maps isn’t exactly new — the team released the same joke back in 2015 — but perhaps it’s done so again because of how popular it was when it first came around. Obviously, the only way to roll out Pac-Maps: The Sequel is to do it with Ms. Pac-Man. Google Gnome Dieter Bohn is having a bit of a crisis over here, seeing as two weeks ago, he tweeted a pun that turned into this year’s Google Home April Fools’ joke. It’s a smart gnome for your lawn that can tell you the direction of the wind and inform your child that all living things decompose. Isn’t it a joy? Google Assistant If you ask your Google Assistant about April Fools’ Day, she’ll reply with some silly advice like “don’t trust your relatives” or to remain skeptical of whatever appears to be unusual. Occasionally, she also tells us to check back on April 1st, so we’ll update this section when the clock hits midnight in our local time zone. Google Wind To shoo away clouds from raining on Western Europe’s parade, the local team in The Netherlands unveiled Google Wind, a series of “machine learning” windmills that can blow away cloudy skies for another day. In the past, many of Google Cloud Platform’s April Fools’ jokes have been literal cloud-themed. Google Bubble Wrap Keyboard From the Google Japan team who brought you Google Kazoo, every year the local Input Tools team devises a new form factor for keyboards. This year, it’s bubble wrap (or Puchi Puchi, in Japanese.) The concept machine lets you push the bubble wrap around for letters you need to form sentences, then feed it through a reader to send your message. Some even have scented air filled in the bubbles so you can smell the sea breeze from Hawaii as you pop each pocket. Haptic Helpers Google’s late-in-the-day prank is for the VR crowd. Haptic Helpers is a Geek Squad-style team that will go to your house and help simulate aromas, tastes, and physical sensations to go along with the manufactured audio and visual stimuli. Because what VR really needs to take off is someone wafting a pungent cheese in your face while you virtually visit Paris or holding a blow drier in front of you while you drive. April Fools’ Day is still getting started in many parts of the world (yes, I know, sigh) so check back soon as we continue updating this post. Better yet, if you see any that we’ve missed, feel free to tip us at tips@theverge.com.

WATCH: Google Netherlands to control the weather? Unbelievable! Sun in Holland, starting April 1... Really? By: Trends Desk | Kolkata | Updated: April 1, 2017 2:00 am Netherlands experience good amount of rain most of the year. (Source: Google Netherlands/YouTube) From fetching all the information on our screens at just one click to helping us access global maps and getting accurate weather predictions, Google has made umpteen other things possible for us  — all in our smartphones. Surprisingly, now it has taken one step ahead by claiming to do something unbelievable! While weather predictions can help us prepare ourselves to brace a storm or massive blizzards, a new project has set its eyes to go one notch higher. Announcing its latest project ‘Google Wind’, the company claims to be able to change the direction of winds and control the weather in the Netherlands using Holland’s famous windmills. Can you believe it? Known for its tulips and windmills, the country has a moist climate and there aren’t many sunny days to wake up to. The multinational technology company stepped in to help the Dutch witness bright sunny days! They shared a video on YouTube to show a sneak peek into their project. “Using them [windmills] not to capture wind, but to generate them,” the video caption reads. The bold project even vouches to control the rainfall! Watch the video here.   Well, one shouldn’t get too excited about the wind project as the video was released on March 31. Every year Google brings out a wacky idea that later turns out to be the greatest prank of the year. Remember last year when they launched Google Cardboard Plastic VR glasses? Or the time when they released Gmail motion? Yes, they all were great April Fools’ Day pranks, and this might just be one of those.

Sophie HirshMar 31, 2017 3:19PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestSarah Harrison/Google In 2016, Google put out a call for students across the United States to create a Google Doodle depicting their vision for the future. Among the entries was 15-year-old student Sarah Harrison's doodle, which was a National Finalist in the 10th-to-12th-grade group. Her drawing, A Peaceful Future, depicts people of different identities smiling with their arms around one another, and earned a prime place on Google's home page on Friday, March 31. Behind them are shadows of hands forming peace signs and hearts. "My future is a world where we can all learn to love each other despite our religion, gender, race, ethnicity, or sexuality," Sarah said in a statement on Google's website. "I dream of a future where everyone is safe and accepted wherever they go, whoever they are." In addition to displaying the doodle on Google's home page, Google awarded Sarah a $30,000 college scholarship, a chance to work with the Google Doodle team in California, and a $50,000 Google for Education technology grant that will go to her school in Connecticut. "The winning artists from this year’s contest shared powerful visions for the world of tomorrow with artwork that advocated for a cleaner environment, worldwide equality, advancing technology, and more," said Google's webpage which announced Sarah as the winner. "The next generation showed us a bright and hopeful future." Google also shared other National Finalists' doodles on the page, which are completely inspiring in their unique way. "I hope that in the future we can provide a better life for the animals in the rainforest!" an artist from Nebraska in the K-to-3rd-grade grade group wrote of its Google Doodle. facebook dialog Pinterest Google "In the future, I see equality for women," wrote a finalist from Minnesota in the 8th-to-9th-grade grade group. "I see a world in which all women feel safe and have rights over their own bodies. I see a world in which all women are born with the opportunity to pursue their hopes and dreams." facebook dialog Pinterest Google A Florida teen in the 10th-to-12th-grade group also depicted a future where women are closer to equality. "As a high school senior, and a young woman, I see a future where girls are encouraged to pursue higher education regardless of race, ethnic background, or religious affiliation," she wrote. "I hope this doodle encourages girls to reach for success and to overcome obstacles that may get in their way." facebook dialog Pinterest Google Head to google.com to see Sarah's doodle in action until 3 a.m. Saturday morning.

Just click the little icon (it's unmissable on the mobile app and found on the bottom left on desktop), then off you go. Streets become pellet-filled lanes and Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Sue will give chase until you either run out of lives or decide you've had enough of this little time-waster. Sound at all familiar? The company did something similar with Pac-Man just a couple years ago. While it's far from the freshest goof on the block, I still enjoyed it more than the typical "kooky" what-if scenarios.

The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will compete with many other premium devices on the market, including the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Google’s 2016 flagships are a new product line for the tech giant. They are intended to work with Google’s Daydream virtual reality protocol and its Daydream headset. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will likely also work with Daydream; however, Samsung has not spoken about the compatibility. Samsung’s new devices showcase new features such as the Bixby AI assistant, iris scanning and facial recognition biometrics and a virtual home button replacing a physical key, which expands the device’s display to an 18:9:5 aspect ratio. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are intended to work well with video and with Samsung’s own VR headset, Gear VR. Are you unsure about whether you will purchase the Galaxy S8 or the Pixel? Here’s a comparison of Samsung and Google’s latest flagship smartphones.

Android Pay v1.19 prepares to show full transaction histories even when Pay isn't used, adding support for Nanaco cards in Japan soon [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 3:49am PDTMar 31, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 67 Share on Twitter Total Shares118 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Nanaco card support (Japan) 1.2 code 1.3 Hiding sensitive information from view 1.4 Full transaction histories, even when Android Pay isn't used 2 Download Android Pay v1.19 began rolling out last night, but like many of the its recent updates, there aren't any obvious new features to see after updating. However, a teardown of the app does show there are a few things in the works, or maybe even ready to launch in the near future. Supported cards will soon allow Android Pay to show full transaction history, even if the purchase was made outside of Android Pay. It will soon be possible to block sensitive data from appearing on screen, which will prevent prying eyes from stealing that information. And finally, Japanese users can look forward to support for the Nanaco payment card. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Nanaco card support (Japan) Back in December, Google announced its first official Android Pay partner in Japan would be Rakuten. This obviously wasn't going to be the only payment method to join the club, and now it looks pretty likely that the Nanaco card by Seven will become the second. For those unfamiliar with Nanaco card, and I assume most of our readers are, it's a prepaid eMoney card accepted at various payment terminals in Japan. There are quite a few similarities between Nanaco and Rakuten Edy. In fact, they're similar enough that my original teardown revealing the Rakuten Edy partnership covers most of the salient points. code <string name="seven_company_name">Seven card service</string> <string name="how_to_use_nanaco">How to use nanaco</string> <string name="instore_topup_education_subtitle">Then you can use Android Pay wherever nanaco is accepted</string> <string name="instore_topup_education_title">Your nanaco card was created.

Please click delete button below to delete the nanaco card. If you have any question, please reach out to nanaco customer support (0570–071–555). nanaco number: %1$s Error code: AMBE10</string> <string name="nanaco_information_share_disclaimer">By continuing, you agree to share this info with nanaco</string> <string name="nanaco_name">nanaco</string> <string name="nanaco_sign_up_form_message">Enter your info to create a nanaco account</string> <string name="nanaco_too_young_error">Must be at least 16 years old</string> <string name="nanaco_tos_link_label">Terms and Conditions of nanaco mobile</string> It's never safe to predict launch dates, but the teardown for the Rakuten Edy card was followed only a few days later by an official announcement, and the same thing could certainly happen again with Nanaco. Unlike the launch of Rakuten Edy support, there's no mention of promotional incentives for signing up. Hiding sensitive information from view Security has been a major factory in the evolution of our smartphones, but there are still gaps where information can leak in one way or another. One of the easiest ways for somebody to get some of your information is simply by looking at it when your phone is showing it. Google seems to be planning to remedy this with a couple of new buttons that allow users to individually hide the barcode and member ID for cards. <string name="hide_barcode_link">Hide barcode</string> <string name="hide_member_id_link">Hide member ID</string> It seems odd to single out these two things and not offer it for other sensitive fields, but it's certainly possible for Google to add more in the future. There aren't any clear indicators about what will appear in place of the barcode and member ID, but I suspect they will be simple replacements, like asterisks for the member ID and a black box for the barcode. Full transaction histories, even when Android Pay isn't used If you've used Android Pay for a little while, there's a good chance you've noticed that it only tracks transactions made with Android Pay itself, not those made directly with the card or through non-physical means (e.g. online purchases). This isn't too surprising since Google would need access to transaction history direct from the provider of the payment card to fill in the gaps. As it turns out, that's something Google is actually going to do. New lines of text appear in the latest update saying that some cards will be able to show full transaction history, even for those made outside of Android Pay. This is limited to just those cards that support it, and that list might be fairly short to begin with. <string name="payment_card_setting_heading">Non-Android Pay Transactions</string> <string name="payment_card_setting_subheading">Display transactions made outside of Android Pay.</string> <string name="payment_card_setting_subsubheading">For cards that support this feature.</string> Since there's no mention of entering login name and password, it seems like Google must be working out deals with providers rather than opening an account and merely scraping for the history like many financial tracking services have been known to do. There's actually not much more to take away from the limited text that's here, so that's going to be it for this one. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Yay. Tony Pettinato Simple is the only card you have? 2kool4skool "Only"? People have more than one card? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...Yes? Many/most people have multiple credit cards in addition to their checking account. 2kool4skool Consumerism at its best. Lucky for me I guess, I never feel the needs to have more than one card. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Plenty of reasons beyond mere consumerism, but cool, whatever makes you happy. Kevin Sword Having a credit card is a good idea, but having multiple isn't really necessary. When you need a loan, and for other financial things, having a credit history is pretty important. Roh_Mish Don't know about US but here many stores tie up with banks for credit/debit card only discounts on that bank. Dee Norbert Transaction history will be available in Europe next year when PSD2 will be applied to banks. And they will make an API. 4Ui812 So if people use Samsung pay for purchases Google will still have access that information ? I understand that using android the answer should be a obvious yes but I don't like it. Google will find some monetary value in this information. I'm sure Samsung sells it but that's beside the point. Jens Knutson This will be an opt in feature. There's no way they'll just declare that they get to *download your payment history* without asking. poop. No, Android Pay and Samsung Pay are entirely separate financial services, that compete with each other. They are in no way linked. Neither Google or Samsung would be able to sell or use your purchase history for anything without notifying you of such a huge thing Brandon Edge I agree with the point about selling the data, but I think what they were referring to was that if you link your card to both services, if you make a payment with Samsung pay, and have the transaction history feature enabled, it'll show the transaction in android pay as well. Which should be true. Thor It's really a perfect time to launch Android Pay here in India when the country is moving towards cashless modes of payments. Samsung Pay is already here. Roh_Mish Problem is we still don't have nfc enabled terminals in many places and the laws for contactless payments is unclear and too restrictive at best. wickets I wish there was a way that android pay captured POS receipts....what a win-win that would be tj This is the feature I've been wanting for a long time, digital receipts would make managing returns so much easier. Ailín Ó’S I really wish it showed more than just the last 10 transactions used with Pay though.

The online archive, which spanned millions of digital pages covering roughly 120 years of local history in city newspapers, had been available at MPL since 2009 through the Google News Archive. The database was removed without warning, leaving researchers, genealogists, and other library patrons in the lurch. But Chris Stegman, who took over as Milwaukee Journal Sentinel president in June, said the digital archive’s disappearance was nothing more than an unfortunate mix-up caused by a switch to a new computer system at the newspaper, which was purchased by the Gannett Corporation in April. “That’s hopefully going to be resolved soon,” he said of the archive’s removal, adding that he could not pinpoint a more precise date for its return. Google will no longer host the online material, Stegman added. “The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has a partnership with NewsBank to develop and maintain a digitized, permanent collection of our valuable archival information,” Stegman wrote in a September 14 e-mail to LJ. “This is a massive development project involving digitizing millions of pages of microfilm. Once completed, NewsBank will provide the archive service to our newspaper and community, including the Milwaukee Public Library.” He continued: “NewsBank and the Milwaukee Public Library are in discussion to establish the business terms for this service. The library currently has a no-fee trial of the sample collection; library patron access to the archive is subject to further negotiation and agreement between NewsBank and the library.” Loss left a gap Paula Kiely, MPL’s director, said the sudden loss of the archive caused no small amount of consternation for some MPL patrons, who were using it as a valuable research tool. “I imagine it’s like losing your hard drive,” she said, adding that library officials had no previous information as to when, or if, the archive would return or why it went away in the first place. “For some, the resource affected their work lives; for others, a connection with their families. Some have indicated that research they’ve done over an extended period of time and bookmarked—for some, hundreds of articles—has been lost to them. We hope when full access is returned that these bookmarks will also be restored.” Cathy Markwiese, MPL’s metadata librarian, said she tried diligently after August 16 to contact Google seeking an explanation for the archive’s removal, but made very little headway. Google’s press office did respond to LJ’s separate inquiry. “Google just hosted the content and the Milwaukee Journal requested the removal because they will soon be offering the archive via their own product,” wrote Maggie Shiels, a corporate communications officer with the Mountain View, CA, tech giant. Content contribution There’s another reason why MPL officials were alarmed to see the Google content vanish: The library had donated almost a third of the source material used to construct that archive in the first place. In 2009, when Google began digitizing microfilm and other perishable sources to create the newspaper database, the company found it lacked a significant amount of Milwaukee material. MPL, it turned out, had a large trove of much-needed microfilm, Kiely said, and the library board voted to turn it over free of charge in the name of building a modern sustainable online resource. Markwiese said that contribution of “master film” amounted to about 30 percent of what Google would eventually offer in its Milwaukee newspaper archive. This included Milwaukee Journal pages from 1910–20 and the Milwaukee Sentinel from 1837–1909. Those now-defunct dailies merged in 1995 to form the Journal Sentinel. A costly competitor The recent disappearance of that Google archive proved puzzling to MPL officials for another reason. For months, they have been wrestling with whether or not to buy a digital newspaper database from Florida-based NewsBank. The Journal Sentinel has been working with NewsBank for the last year or two to build a brand new newspaper archive. MPL officials have already been provided with large samples of this online material (which the library has not made available to patrons), Markwiese said. The librarian readily concedes the new archive has fewer chronological gaps, offers easier-to-read images, and is generally more user-friendly than the older Google product. It’s also much costlier. In May, NewsBank quoted its prices: The full menu of the new Journal Sentinel archive options would cost almost $1.5 million, Kiely said, although there are more inexpensive options that provide less online material. The library would also be charged an annual 1 percent network-hosting fee, with that amount scheduled to rise after three years. That price, Kiely added, is “out of reach” for the library right now, although talks with NewsBank are continuing. Chuck Palsho, president of NewsBank’s media services, said a company representative will visit Milwaukee in September to discuss the newspaper archive and help brainstorm for ways MPL can secure the necessary funding. “This is a very high-demand product,” Palsho said. “The challenge is more in the fundraising.” Kiely said she has engaged in talks with some Wisconsin state officials about “broader strategies” to make such a purchase possible, although it’s too early to tell if the state may be willing to provide any type of grant. MPL already subscribes to some NewsBank content, including a database of Journal Sentinel material from 1990 to the present day, and America’s Obituaries & Death Notices, a popular genealogy resource. But the expanded newspaper archive would not be another subscription; MPL would own that content outright. Added Markwiese, “I think we’re living in a capitalist society. They (NewsBank) saw a need. They have a product. They charge what the market will bear.” Markwiese said MPL’s annual materials budget is about $1.8 million (which covers, among other things, database subscriptions), so spending almost $1.5 million of that on the NewsBank digital archive was not feasible. Palsho, for his part, said the archive is not intended for sale as a materials purchase. He said it’s intended as a capital expense to be covered through grants or other outside donations. Prior to the newspaper’s statement that the library would still receive free access, national media Slate’s Future Tense had picked up the story of the Google takedown and proposed NewsBank replacement. There was even a petition started at MoveOn to restore the Google archive.

Reply Wm McQuerry says: February 16, 2017 at 10:10 pm Archive cancellation was suppose to be short lived by the Journal, 7 months later still no Archives . I received email last wee from Stegman who apologized for delay and said it would be up shortly. I have my doubt. Anything you can add? Thanks Reply Bill McQuerry says: March 11, 2017 at 6:14 pm Mr Stegman told me several months ago that the archives would soon be up? I think he is stonewalling me. What exactly is the problem? Please tell me? Reply Bill McQuerry says: March 11, 2017 at 6:15 pm Is there a place where I can purchase access? Reply John Grube says: March 15, 2017 at 12:27 pm Bill, (and anyone else interested) I don’t believe the archive is ever coming back. I have tried buying a memebership at “GeneologyBank (another NewsBank business), but, even though they claim to have the entire archive, most searches bring up nothing, even items that I KNOW were there previously (with Google News). I suspect that in their greedy desire to make the information inaccessible, they have corrupted the databases connected with the archive. Jodi says: March 31, 2017 at 3:45 pm I was told by someone at the Journal that a new, better archive was going to be put online very soon. I was told that probably 6-12 months ago now. There is still no archive available anywhere. I asked them why they couldn’t have left the archives on Google until they got the new system up & running – no answer. I asked them if this was being done out of greed & now what once was free would now cost money – again, no answer. I emailed them for an update on the status & yes, once again, no answer. I told them that if this is how they conduct business, once my newspaper subscription came due, I would not be renewing it & I didn’t. I refuse to give my money to a company that only cares about $$$$$. The archives that Google created, was created from newspaper microfiche that is available for free at the local public libraries so it’s not like they were getting cheated out of anything. The Google service was such a HUGE resource for me as I was using it to help me with my genealogy. As someone who is disabled, it’s not always feasible to physically go to the library to look things up. These archives made it possible to access this information without having to go to the physical location. It also made the info available to everyone regardless of where you lived. If you don’t happen to live in Milwaukee county, you can’t access any of the online resources available through the Milwaukee Public Library website because you need to have a library card. In one of my my many emails to the Milw Journal, I advised them of those issues as well but they didn’t seem to care. In doing my research I’ve had to access several newspapers across the country & it seems the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel is the only one out there causing all these problems for customers who need access to their archives.

Google’s Director of Engineering, Ray Kurzweil, thinks it’s a possibility. He says that living in a fleshly shell for eternity could become a reality as soon as 2029, when scientists are set to unveil special “nano-bots” that will supposedly be able to navigate throughout people’s bodies to fight disease and prevent death. In just a little more than 10 years, Kurzweil says, medical technologies will have become so advanced that the aging process could be stopped entirely. People will no longer develop wrinkles, they’ll no longer get sick with debilitating illness, and they’ll finally achieve what many in the tech world have been pushing for: a complete and total merger of human flesh with machines. “I believe we will reach a point around 2029 when medical technologies will add one additional year every year to your life expectancy,” Kurzweil is quoted as saying by the U.K.’s Express. “By that, I don’t mean life expectancy based on your birthdate, but rather your remaining life expectancy.” What will make this all possible, in Kurzweil’s view, is the development of groundbreaking nanotechnology that can be directly implanted into the human body to keep it functioning in ways that the aging process would otherwise degrade. Nano-bots with the ability to help boost the immune system, for instance, or fight disease will replace traditional forms of medicine that only delay the inevitable. According to those working on the technology, these nano-bots will have a disease-fighting success rate of close to 100 percent, meaning there will be no chance of failure once they’re in motion. Some have referred to this concept as technological singularity, or the merger of artificially-intelligent machines with the human form. Humans will be able to live forever by 2045, Kurzweil says While the platform for this type of nano-bot technology is expected to be released around 2029, Kurzweil says, it won’t be until 2045 that the first humans will be able to live in perpetuity with no chance of death. By this point, introducing nano-bots into people’s bodies will have surpassed the beta-testing process and become marketable to the masses. Beyond this, Kurzweil and his acolytes hope to one day connect people’s brains directly to the internet, or to the “cloud,” as the supposed next step in human “evolution.” Kurzweil and his colleagues believe that humans have reached the maximum capacity at this stage in human development, and must now move to the next phase. (RELATED: More information on the push towards trans-humanism is available at TransHumanism.News.) This phase involves making human beings more machine-like, which Kurzweil believes will result in improvements in the way people live and interact with one another. If his wish becomes a reality, the world will resemble something like the movie The Matrix, in which humans could end up living in tiny pods with their fleshly bodies and brains connected to the “hive mind” as part of some superficial and fake reality. Machines do much of our thinking already. Mobile “smartphones” can already pull up anything our hearts desire, on a whim, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are beginning to take shape as an automated replacement for human ingenuity and creative expression. The human form and existence, in other words, is being pushed to obsolescence by people like Kurzweil, and corporations like Google, that seem to worship technology over humanity. “We’ll create more profound forms of communication than we’re familiar with today, more profound music and funnier jokes,” Kurzweil believes, perhaps in subconscious discontent with his own apparent shortcomings as a fully-functioning and expressive human being. “We’ll be funnier. We’ll be sexier. We’ll be more adept at expressing loving sentiments.” Sources: Express.co.uk DigitalTrends.com Previous :Subway under fire for paying pittance wages to employees Next : Warning: Global shortage of laptop and cell phone materials on the horizon Join the Health Ranger's FREE email newsletter Get breaking news alerts on GMOs, fluoride, superfoods, natural cures and more...

That means tech companies are briefly turning their apps and services into something lighthearted for the silly holiday. And for the last few years, Google has transformed its Maps app and web service into a version of Pac-Man. This year, Google did it again. Check out Maps for Android, iOS, and desktop to find "Ms. Pac-Man". Simply open up Maps, and then click on the Pac-Maps button on the right. Once you press the button, your Map will turn into an arcade-style grid. On Android, you'll be taken to a random location, though some iOS users have claimed they could choose anywhere they wanted to play. The web version does appear to let you pick your own levels. Anyway, once you land some place, you'll be given five lives to chomp fruit, collect dots, and outrun ghosts Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Sue. Android O: What's the story so far? Google Photos tips and tricks: Store and edit your photos like a pro There doesn't seem to be as many features as last year's prank, but it's still fun to play nevertheless. Google said Ms. Pac-Man will be available from 31 March until 4 April. You can even sign in to save your top score on a leaderboard and share it with friends. Oh, and for those who don't know, Ms. Pac-Man is from the golden age of arcade video games. It released in 1981 with a female protagonist, new mazes, and other changes over the original Pac-Man.

Google says its UK offices, employing just under 3,000 people, are not big enough to count as a “permanent establishment” and that it therefore should pay the majority of its taxes elsewhere. "As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK”, a spokesperson said. “We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff.” In January 2015, Google finalised a deal with HMRC that saw it pay £130m in unpaid tax dating back ten years. George Osborne, the then Chancellor, hailed the agreement as a “major success” but was widely criticised for a deal that opponents said let Google get away with avoiding millions of pounds in tax.   First pictures of Google's new offices in King’s Cross 7 show all First pictures of Google's new offices in King’s Cross 1/7 Google's new Kings Cross office On Monday June 20, around 800 software engineers will be the first of 2,500 Google employees to relocate in the brand new 371,000 square feet, 11 storeys office, designed by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM).

Tom Soar 7/7 Google's new Kings Cross office Around 800 engineers will move in during the first phase and there will be a total capacity of 2,500 after the second phase is complete later this year. Tom Soar Following publication of the latest accounts, opposition parties claimed Google is still not paying enough tax. “It seems that the so called 'successful' tax deal with Google that George Osborne boasted about last year has meant that they are still not paying their fair share under his successor Philip Hammond,”  said John McDonnell, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor. “We urgently need clarity on HMRC’s relationship with Google and what reassurances have been provided to the company. “It is a national disgrace that by paying just £36 million in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country. And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory Government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year’s scandal.” Read more Google Maps Pac-Man: You can play the arcade game on your phone What people think of every country in the world, according to Google Google just launched a programme to teach black students to code Google Maps will let strangers track your real-time location Susan Cramer, the Liberal Democrats’ shadow chancellor, said Google’s tax arrangement was “utterly unfair”. "It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes”, she said.  "The Government seem to be letting big online businesses off the hook, while small businesses, the heart of our high streets get whacked by ever increasing business rates.

Case in point: go to Google Maps right now and you can play a game (or several) of Ms. Pac-Man, the classic arcade game and follow-up to the popular Pac-Man. At the lower left of Maps on a browser, next to Earth, you'll see an image of Ms. Pac-Man that reads "Insert Coin." It will then evaluate the map and redesign it into a level from the game. If the location currently shown doesn't have enough streets to work, you can choose a random location or pick a specific city. You can also play on your iOS or Android device Google Maps app. Also: Here's why we celebrate April Fools' Day (probably) Ready to eat pitless avocados in a Harambe bed? You can't because April Fools Google's love of video games goes well beyond April Fools' Day. For example, search "do a barrel roll" and the screen will do a 360-degree turn, in honor of the classic Nintendo series Star Fox. Type in "zerg rush" — a nod to the Blizzard game StarCraft — and you'll see several O's from the Google logo drop down and starting eating away at search results.

Google Maps users can open the app on their desktop or smartphone and tap an icon or click on a small window bearing the words "Insert Coin" to guide the bow-wearing, mouth-flapping heroine to collect dots around a map of their current location. If the player's current location doesn't contain the proper geography or amount of roads to create a game area, the app selects a random location somewhere in the world. Players are given five chances to eat up all the dots and fruit that appear on the map while avoiding the five enemy ghosts Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. Google released a similar Google Maps-based game in 2014 that had players collect creatures from the video game series Pokemon by tapping map locations around the world using the app. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for more news from UPI.com Related UPI Stories Chrome extension 'Nope' wards off co-workers with fake phone call Wisconsin county wants 'Pokemon Go' to pay for use of parks Man eats nearly $100 worth of free food on his birthday Comments Topics: Google Latest Headlines Bystanders rush to help water buffalo mistaken for drowning cow 9 hours ago ago March 31 (UPI) -- An Australian woman has a message for concerned neighbors: the apparent drowning cow on her property is actually a water buffalo having the time of her life.

RELATED ARTICLES How to Set Up the Google Wi-Fi System How to Pause Internet Access on Google Wi-Fi Obviously, keep in mind that factory resetting Google Wi-Fi will delete your Wi-Fi network and you won’t be able to connect to it, so make sure you’re ready to set up a new network immediately after. To begin, open up the Google Wi-Fi app on your phone and tap the right-hand side tab with the settings gear icon and three other circles. Next, tap on “Network Settings”. At the top, tap on “Wifi points”. There will also be a number next to it inside parentheses. Select “Factory Reset”. Tap on “Factory Reset” at the bottom. Hit “Continue” when the pop-up appears. This process will take about five minutes, and you can look at the progress bar below the text to see how far along it is. Once the factory reset process is complete, hit “Done” at the bottom. You’ll then be taken back to the setup process where you can begin to set it all up again if you’d like. Otherwise, just exit the app and unplug your Google Wi-Fi units if you plan on selling or moving them.

Yes April Fool’s Day might be just around the corner, but you can now play Ms Pac-Man in Google Maps, really. Getting the jump on the day of jokes, Google has given its iOS and Android Google Maps an arcade gaming makeover. To play, all you have to do is open the app and click the new pink, Ms Pac-Man adorned circle in the bottom right hand corner, where the usual current location and navigation buttons still sit. Once pressed, you’ll be able to watch in wonder as your current location gets transformed into a playable level of Ms Pac-Man with your local streets acting as the game board. Playing is simple, just swipe in the direction you want to go and stifle the excited giggles as your route to the shops becomes an tasty dots adorned escape route from those pesky ghosts. Related: Best iPhone games 2017 Be warned though, this game is a whole lot trickier than the classic arcade game with the mishmash array of local side streets often leading you into dead-ends and cul-de-sacs, and the ghosts seemingly quicker and sharper. With Google having yet to state how long the brilliant, playable easter egg will be around, you’ll want to get a game in now before it’s too late. This isn’t the first time Google has given one of its services a Pac-Man themed makeover. Back in 2010 the search giant celebrated the iconic game’s 30th birthday by transforming the day’s Google Doodle into a playable level. This was followed up on April Fool’s Day 2015 when the desktop version of Google Maps was given the same road-transforming treatment as today’s mobile version.

Twitter Facebook Google's Android hacking contest fails to attract exploits The $200,000 bounty Google offered to hack its Android OS was not enough to tempt researchers IDG Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 01 April, 2017 05:32 - - - - print email Comments Six months ago, Google offered to pay US$200,000 to any researcher who could remotely hack into an Android device by knowing only the victim's phone number and email address. No one stepped up to the challenge. While that might sound like good news and a testament to the mobile operating system's strong security, that's likely not the reason why the company's Project Zero Prize contest attracted so little interest. From the start, people pointed out that $200,000 was too low a prize for a remote exploit chain that wouldn't rely on user interaction. "If one could do this, the exploit could be sold to other companies or entities for a much higher price," one user responded to the original contest announcement in September. "Many buyers out there could pay more than this price; 200k not worth for finding needle under haystack," said another. Google was forced to acknowledge this, noting in a blog post this week that "the prize amount might have been too low considering the type of bugs required to win this contest." Other reasons that might have led to the lack of interest, according to the company's security team, might be the high complexity of such exploits and the existence of competing contests where the rules were less strict. In order to gain root or kernel privileges on Android and fully compromise a device, an attacker would have to chain multiple vulnerabilities together. At the very least, they would need a flaw that would allow them to remotely execute code on the device, for example within the context of an application, and then a privilege escalation vulnerability to escape the application sandbox. Judging by Android's monthly security bulletins, there's no shortage of privilege escalation vulnerabilities. However, Google wanted for exploits submitted as part of this contest to not rely on any form of user interaction. This means the attacks should have worked without users clicking on malicious links, visiting rogue websites, receiving and opening files, and so on. This rule significantly restricted the entry points that researchers could use to attack a device. The first vulnerability in the chain would have had to be located in the operating system's built-in messaging functions like SMS or MMS, or in the baseband firmware -- the low-level software that controls the phone's modem and which can be attacked over the cellular network. One vulnerability that would have met these criteria was discovered in 2015 in a core Android media processing library called Stagefright, with researchers from mobile security firm Zimperium finding the vulnerability. The flaw, which triggered a large coordinated Android patching effort at the time, could have been exploited by simply placing a specially crafted media file anywhere on the device's storage. One way to do that involved sending a multimedia message (MMS) to targeted users and didn't require any interaction on their part. Merely receiving such a message was enough for successful exploitation. Many similar vulnerabilities have since been found in Stagefright and in other Android media processing components, but Google changed the default behavior of the built-in messaging apps to no longer retrieve MMS messages automatically, closing that avenue for future exploits. "Remote, unassisted, bugs are rare and require a lot of creativity and sophistication," said Zuk Avraham, founder and chairman of Zimperium, via email. They're worth much more than $200,000, he said. An exploit acquisition firm called Zerodium is also offering $200,000 for remote Android jailbreaks, but it doesn't put a restriction on user interaction. Zerodium sells the exploits it acquires to their customers, including to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. So why go to the trouble of finding rare vulnerabilities to build fully unassisted attack chains when you can get the same amount of money -- or even more on the black market -- for less sophisticated exploits? "Overall, this contest was a learning experience, and we hope to put what we’ve learned to use in Google’s rewards programs and future contests," Natalie Silvanovich, a member of Google's Project Zero team, said in the blog post. To that end, the team is expecting comments and suggestions from security researchers, she said. It's worth mentioning that despite this apparent failure, Google is a bug bounty pioneer and has run some of the most successful security reward programs over the years covering both its software and online services. There's little chance that vendors will ever be able to offer the same amount of money for exploits as criminal organizations, intelligence agencies, or exploit brokers. Ultimately, bug bounty programs and hacking contests are aimed at researchers who have an inclination toward responsible disclosure to begin with. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

The theme for this year's annual event was "What I see for the future." Sarah Harrison, a sophomore at Bunnell High School in Stratford, depicted her vision of inclusion and acceptance in her artwork titled "A Peaceful Future." Top Google Doodles Google “My future is a world where we can all learn to love each other despite our religion, gender, race, ethnicity, or sexuality. I dream of a future where everyone is safe and accepted wherever they go, whoever they are,” Harrison wrote in her Doodle submission. Sarah will also receive a $30,000 college scholarship and visit Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, to meet with the Doodle team. Her high school will receive a $50,000 Google for Education grant to spend on technology and advance STEM programs. William Floyd, head of external affairs for Google, said in a statement that this year’s competition was meant to get students thinking about the future they want to create for the world and the submissions were nothing short of inspiring. “Ultimately, Sarah’s doodle captured the best of everything we saw, representing values like diversity, inclusion, and respect in an inspiring and creative image,” he said. Harrison said she was thinking about the current state of the world when designing her artwork. “When I started, I was thinking of how there’s a lot of animosity toward diverse communities of people in the world right now,” Harrison said. “So I wanted to draw something that I hoped would show that we can all get along well, and that it’s possible for us to be happy with each other. I want everyone try to be more open, accepting, and respectful to people. You don’t know what they’ve been through - and they don’t know what you’ve been through - so we all deserve respect from each other.” The finalists from each of the different age groups between K-12 will receive a $5,000 college scholarship and a Chromebook, as well as a trip to the Googleplex to meet some professional Doodlers at Google. Doodles are a regular feature on the Google.com search page. Google has often used the artwork to celebrate holidays, spotlight causes and honor people and places.

Here's a roundup of notable April Fools' tech pranks this year. Don't get your hopes set you'll be able to take home one of these outlandish products. Google Courtesy of Google Google Gnome helps make your connected yard dreams a reality. Smart homes? Google is doubling down on smart gnomes. The Google Gnome device will give homeowners the "connected yard" of their dreams. Just walk outside and speak your command, and Google's army of helper gnomes will come to the rescue. You can find the device in the Google Store or the Made by Google site. Google Maps Source: Google Maps Ms. Pac-Man doesn't need help from Google Maps with directions. If you don't need to get to your destination in a hurry, Google Maps added a Ms. Pac-Man mode to further distract you from your task at hand. To play, open your Google Maps app and click on the pink Ms. Pac-Man icon on the right side of the screen. The idea is recycled from 2015's Pac-Man integration, but hey, if it isn't broke, then don't fix it. Chegg Education technology company has released a new energy drink called "Chugg." Powered by "a crap ton of caffeine" and "ground up unicorn horns," alleged testimonials claim you can down this drink, not sleep for 72 hours and write an entire thesis. Honda Ok, Honda isn't a tech company, but this is pretty good. Instead of your standard honk, "Honda Horn Emojis" will play a themed tune appropriately tied to a illustrated expression button on your steering wheel. Hulu Don't have time to watch your favorite show? Hulu's Hu abbreviates not only its name, but shortens episodes into eight seconds (or slightly more) to capture your fleeting attention. T-Mobile You'll never go without service when you're wearing your T-Mobile ONEsie. Slip on this wearable tech made from nano technology and you'll be fully covered, whether through full bars service or literally all-over fitness tracking. Prysm Telecommuting has evolved, thanks to the Prysm Avatar. Send your drone to work, and it will project a full-sized hologram of you in your office. Wardrobe options include a "programmer" t-shirt look, a "Silicon Valley" hoodie outfit, and a business casual suit. Note: CNBC parent company NBCUniversal is an investor in Hulu.

Upon opening the Google Maps app, there should be a pink Ms. Pac-Man icon in the bottom right of the app.  iOS screenshot   While the game was a little more hidden with its first prank with the Pac-Man version in 2015. After updating the app and reopening it, the pink icon was joined by a brief preview screen at the bottom of the screen.  The game is also available on Google's desktop and web template.  A much larger screen to "waka, waka, waka" with Desktop screenshot  Instead of automatically placing the user where they're currently at the app Google throws you in a completely random spot. The Verge reports that iOS lets users pick the map while Android shoots you off into a random area.  Some advice, find an area with a bunch of connecting, intersecting worlds and take a virtual trip back to a time of more simple video games.  About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 MLive Media Group.

Gary Prior/Getty Images for Reebok Book your next workout session using Google Reserve, their newly-launched platform set to rival ClassPass. While this booking service doesn’t provide discounts like ClassPass, it does offer a detailed list of upcoming workouts, including the price and locations (using Google Maps, of course). As ClassPass prices started getting higher and higher, many people said goodbye to the app for good, or kept paying for a limited number of classes because of the convenience of booking by app immediately. But now, boutique fitness booking is even easier than Googling somebody. It’s the new ClassPass, minus the discount and monthly fee. Google Reserve When you pop open the platform, they list hyper-specific options, including “yoga this evening,” “Pilates before work” and even “dancing Friday night,” if you’re really trying to get the party started. The options are accompanied class descriptions, user ratings and prices. A pilot for the platform ran in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, but now it’s officially live everywhere, with studios working alongside Google’s scheduling partners, including Mindbody. After booking a class, Reserve will start making recommendations for you; it’s just like ClassPass, only without the monthly fee.

No one stepped up to the challenge. While that might sound like good news and a testament to the mobile operating system's strong security, that's likely not the reason why the company's Project Zero Prize contest attracted so little interest. From the start, people pointed out that $200,000 was too low a prize for a remote exploit chain that wouldn't rely on user interaction. "If one could do this, the exploit could be sold to other companies or entities for a much higher price," one user responded to the original contest announcement in September. "Many buyers out there could pay more than this price; 200k not worth for finding needle under haystack," said another. Google was forced to acknowledge this, noting in a blog post this week that "the prize amount might have been too low considering the type of bugs required to win this contest." Other reasons that might have led to the lack of interest, according to the company's security team, might be the high complexity of such exploits and the existence of competing contests where the rules were less strict. In order to gain root or kernel privileges on Android and fully compromise a device, an attacker would have to chain multiple vulnerabilities together. At the very least, they would need a flaw that would allow them to remotely execute code on the device, for example within the context of an application, and then a privilege escalation vulnerability to escape the application sandbox. Judging by Android's monthly security bulletins, there's no shortage of privilege escalation vulnerabilities. However, Google wanted for exploits submitted as part of this contest to not rely on any form of user interaction. This means the attacks should have worked without users clicking on malicious links, visiting rogue websites, receiving and opening files, and so on. This rule significantly restricted the entry points that researchers could use to attack a device. The first vulnerability in the chain would have had to be located in the operating system's built-in messaging functions like SMS or MMS, or in the baseband firmware -- the low-level software that controls the phone's modem and which can be attacked over the cellular network. One vulnerability that would have met these criteria was discovered in 2015 in a core Android media processing library called Stagefright, with researchers from mobile security firm Zimperium finding the vulnerability. The flaw, which triggered a large coordinated Android patching effort at the time, could have been exploited by simply placing a specially crafted media file anywhere on the device's storage. One way to do that involved sending a multimedia message (MMS) to targeted users and didn't require any interaction on their part. Merely receiving such a message was enough for successful exploitation. Many similar vulnerabilities have since been found in Stagefright and in other Android media processing components, but Google changed the default behavior of the built-in messaging apps to no longer retrieve MMS messages automatically, closing that avenue for future exploits. "Remote, unassisted, bugs are rare and require a lot of creativity and sophistication," said Zuk Avraham, founder and chairman of Zimperium, via email. They're worth much more than $200,000, he said. An exploit acquisition firm called Zerodium is also offering $200,000 for remote Android jailbreaks, but it doesn't put a restriction on user interaction. Zerodium sells the exploits it acquires to their customers, including to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. So why go to the trouble of finding rare vulnerabilities to build fully unassisted attack chains when you can get the same amount of money -- or even more on the black market -- for less sophisticated exploits? "Overall, this contest was a learning experience, and we hope to put what we’ve learned to use in Google’s rewards programs and future contests," Natalie Silvanovich, a member of Google's Project Zero team, said in the blog post. To that end, the team is expecting comments and suggestions from security researchers, she said. It's worth mentioning that despite this apparent failure, Google is a bug bounty pioneer and has run some of the most successful security reward programs over the years covering both its software and online services. There's little chance that vendors will ever be able to offer the same amount of money for exploits as criminal organizations, intelligence agencies, or exploit brokers. Ultimately, bug bounty programs and hacking contests are aimed at researchers who have an inclination toward responsible disclosure to begin with.

By Bloomberg News Mar 31, 2017 at 1:46 pm | Print View An advertiser boycott of YouTube is testing a critical and much-hyped part of Google’s future — its prowess in artificial intelligence. Some experts in the field say the technology isn’t up to scratch yet, but that if any company can solve the problem at hand, it’s the online search giant. Some of the world’s biggest marketers halted YouTube spending this month after ads from large brands were found running alongside hateful and extremist videos. Google parent, Alphabet Inc., risks losing $750 million in revenue this year from the debacle, analysts at Nomura Instinet estimated this week. That’s less than one percent of projected sales this year, so it can weather the financial storm. But it’s likely an incentive for the company to re-direct AI investments and accelerate research efforts already underway. To detect and police content across YouTube’s sprawling library, and ensure ads don’t run against questionable content, Google must solve an AI problem no one has cracked yet — automatically understanding everything that’s going on in videos, including gesticulations and other human nuances. A potential solution lies in machine learning, a powerful AI technique for automatically recognizing patterns across reams of data — a Google specialty. CEO Sundar Pichai has pledged to infuse the technology across all its products, and the company touts its abilities in the field to software developers, cloud-computing clients, advertisers and shareholders. Computer scientists doubt technology alone can expunge offensive videos. “We’re not there yet where we can, say, find all extremist content,” said Hany Farid, a Dartmouth professor and senior adviser to the Counter Extremism Project, which has repeatedly called on YouTube to tackle this problem. He recommends companies such as Google and Facebook Inc. deploy more human editors to filter content. “Machine learning, AI is nowhere near that yet,” he said. “Don’t believe the hype.” Like what you're reading?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Mattersight wants to use AI and Alexa to send you ads based on your personality Khari Johnson@kharijohnson March 31, 2017 11:41 AM Tags: ai, Alexa, Amazon Echo, artificial intelligence, biometrics, Google Assistant, Google Home, Mattersight, voice biometrics Above: Amazon Echo Dot As people begin to think about how they feel about ads on intelligent assistants, voice analytics company Mattersight is planning to use unique voice signatures to deliver personalized advertisements and bots. Using artificial intelligence to recognize your personality within 30 seconds, Mattersight wants to deliver personalized ads and bots to Amazon Echo, Google Home, and other voice-controlled devices. Advertising and biometrics for intelligent assistants have been in the news recently. Earlier this month, the internet worked itself into a tizzy over what seemed an awful lot like advertisements for the Beauty and the Beast movie on Google Home. Amazon is also reportedly working on commands that respond to unique voices. And connected cars that respond to the driver are in the works. “We know how words or language correlate with personality styles. We ultimately think of ourselves fitting into that landscape, as we’re going to train bots how to be empathetic,” said Mattersight VP of data science Andrew Traba. Mattersight assigns personality profiles to the people who call major brands, and it wants to bring that same service to intelligent assistants, using voice biometrics as an identifier instead of phone numbers. Who’s calling? For more than a decade, Mattersight has recorded more than a billion customer service phone calls for companies like Wells Fargo, Hilton Hotels, Progressive Insurance, and CVS. Within 30 seconds Mattersight’s machine learning-trained algorithms can determine what kind of personality you have based on the words you use. The company uses a method called process communication model to analyze the words used by customers. Created by Dr. Taibi Kahler in the 1970s, the process communication model follows every second of human interaction and predict outcomes. NASA used the model for more than 20 years in the astronaut selection process. Profiles attached to phone numbers are used to decide the script an agent should follow or the specific customer service agent a specific customer should speak with. “What Mattersight’s cooking up in its lab now is how can we implement through API or web services the same technology into a bot that we’ve done in routing in a call center, so that if the bot recognizes that this is Andy talking to it, Andy wants to be spoken to in various facts and figures and linear problem solving versus if it’s Andy’s wife, who is a different personality. Then the bot should be fun, energetic, and exciting because that’s how my wife Mariola, that’s how she likes to be spoken to,” Traba said. Traba envisions a future where voice biometrics are used to serve personalized advertising through the army of devices with intelligent assistants. In addition to smart speakers like the Amazon Echo or Google Home, assistants are being placed in all manner of products, such as vacuums, cars, and wheelchairs. Samsung recently announced plans to incorporate its new assistant Bixby into all of its products. “In the same way that there’s information that’s associated to an IP address, there’s information that’s associated to a phone number, we think there’s going to be information that’s associated with my voice print, which is unique as my fingerprint, and are going to allow these bots to look up a database then and say ‘Oh, this voice print is Andy Traba; here is the personality and language he would like to be communicated with,'” he said. Next up: The empathetic car Some companies are already using voice biometrics to provide security and services. Earlier this month, Citi announced it now has one million customers in India and southeast Asia enrolled in its voice authentication program that identifies callers based on voice biometrics. Using software from Nuance Communications, banks like HSBC have also began to use voice recognition to identify customers during phone calls and remove the need for passwords. Also from Nuance, last month Ford began to provide voice recognition for its Sync infotainment system. At that time, Nuance expressed a desire in the future to serve drivers’ needs based on personality and mood. “We’re well on the road to developing the empathetic car which might tell you a joke to cheer you up, offer advice when you need it, remind you of birthdays and keep you alert on a long drive,” a Nuance spokesperson said in a statement. Other recent examples of AI for marketing personalization include Youfirst, a company that tracks the emotional response of people watching YouTube videos, and Influential, who uses natural language to match influence marketers with brands and marketing campaigns and create an influence marketer stock market.

Mac Greer (TMFMac) Mar 31, 2017 at 1:37PM On this episode of Market Foolery, Mac Greer is joined by Motley Fool analysts Ron Gross and Jason Moser as they discuss some of the latest news from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as it expands the Stories feature to its main app.  Meanwhile, Darden Restaurants International (NYSE:DRI) left investors with a tasty earnings beat with an acquisition for dessert, while Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM) continues to lose millions of customers. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 28, 2017. Mac Greer: It's Tuesday, March 28th. Welcome to Market Foolery! I'm Mac Greer, and joining me in studio, we've got Ron Gross from Total Income and Jason Moser from Motley Fool Million Dollar Portfolio. Gentlemen, welcome! Jason Moser: Hey! Ron Gross: Hey, how are you? Greer: Guys, I'm good. Let's begin with Facebook news that looks a whole lot like Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP). On Tuesday, Facebook released its Stories feature in its main mobile app. Stories allows users to post photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. Does that sound familiar at all? Stories was already part of other Facebook apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Now, Jason, they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. But I'm guessing that if you're Snapchat, you could do without this type of flattery. Moser: I would imagine. I think they're probably thinking, "Wow, at some point, could you not just do something original?" But, I mean, that's the name of this game. Social networking in general, it's innovative to a point, but at the end of the day, it's all about free flow of information and figuring out ways to communicate with people. So, whether you're Facebook or Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever, you're always figuring out ways to add new little bells and whistles. I do think, as time goes on, it strikes me that -- and I'm not the biggest on these platforms. I really don't use Facebook all that much, I don't use any of these other things, other than Twitter. But I think, it becomes more and more difficult to use these platforms. It seems like they add more and more bells and whistles to the point that it becomes more and more difficult to use, when really, one of the arguments from inception was that they're easy to use. So, I wonder if we're going to hit a point where they become so difficult to use that they start turning people off, because you do hit a point where you start adding so many bells and whistles in the hopes of evolving and innovating that you start scaring people away. I think that's something that, while old people like us might consider Snapchat difficult to use, I think a lot of the kids that use it generally like its simplicity and quick, free-flowing nature. To me, the question with Snapchat has always been what can they be beyond the Snapchat app? And when they went public, when they were doing the roadshow, they redefined themselves as a camera company because even I think they realized that just being Snapchat isn't going to cut it. That's not going to be a way for them to get big and justify the valuation that the market is giving them today. I do think it's important to note that whether you are using Facebook or Instagram or Messenger or WhatsApp, you're still using Facebook. I think that's a testament to the best strategy in this space -- to own a portfolio of a lot of these apps so that you're going to hit every age group. Facebook is kind of for old people. Instagram is maybe Facebook for younger people. Maybe they're trying to turn Messenger into a SnapChat style offering, as well. It's a unique space, but I think it's really difficult to compete with Facebook because they're already so big. Gross: Yeah, I can't argue with any of that, actually -- Moser: Well, that's good. Stop. Gross: [laughs] I don't think Facebook Stories is going to steal any of Snapchat's glory. I don't think Snapchat is actually worried that all of the sudden people are going to start leaving their platform and moving to Facebook. It didn't happen with Instagram, I don't think it will happen with Facebook proper. But it does behoove Facebook to have a complete offering -- to not have that option to create a story and do those things would hurt it a bit. You want to have all the new bells and whistles on your platform, unless, as you said, it becomes a little too complicated. Now, for my mother-in-law, it's going to be too complicated. But she just won't use that part of it, she will continue to like and share things that are embarrassing about her family. But for the folks our age that do want that ability, it's now, there. Greer: And I hear you say that no one is going to leave Snapchat, or, people aren't necessarily going to leave Snapchat to go to Facebook because of this. But if you are Facebook, you're in a much better position than Snapchat. So, you outlast Snapchat, then you're the only game in town. Gross: Absolutely. We've been talking about the usability and the apps and the companies. Then we start to talk about the stock and the capital structure and all that stuff. You would never choose to be Snapchat as opposed to Facebook, the behemoth here, with an airtight balance sheet, cash flow flowing in, just an incredible market position. Snapchat, I wouldn't touch it. Moser: This is less about stealing people using Snapchat, and more about giving folks a reason not to leave any one of those four Facebook platforms. Snapchat has 158 million daily users or something like that. It sounds like a lot, until you compare it to what Facebook has, and then you realize it doesn't really matter, it's relatively inconsequential, especially when you consider that there's probably a decent amount of cross over there. So, it's really just about Facebook and all of its associated platforms offering the ability to do these extra things as a value add. It's less about stealing Snapchat's users, and more about offering their users more features. Greer: Let's talk about Facebook the stock. Shares up around 25% over the past year. Going forward, what do you think about the stock? Gross: I'm a shareholder. It's hard to make the argument that it's cheap as a value investor, because you have to look out into the future so much and rely so much on the future, so I'll suspend my value investing, I'll take off that hat for a minute and say, I'm a shareholder. I have no intention of selling the stock any time soon, maybe ever. It's the kind of stock that I'm just happy to let sit there, and watch what Zuckerberg can do. Moser: Yeah. I think it's very easy to justify owning this stock today, and hanging on to it indefinitely. We talked a lot about this last decade being the Google decade, this coming decade is probably going to be more of the Facebook decade, given the nature of the move to social. I think that's an advantage that Facebook holds over Google. Google is very utilitarian in nature. You go to Google to find something, and then you go somewhere else when you found what you wanted to find. Facebook is garnering a lot of eyeballs that stick around those properties for a while. So, it strikes me as probably a bigger opportunity over the coming decade to be part of that Facebook story, versus something like Google, given those are the two big players in the ad space. I do want to make the point that, it's a big company today, $400 billion plus. You hear a lot of people talk about, in order for the stock to double, they need to double their market cap. That's not necessarily the case. They could, in theory, buy back shares, return capital to shareholders in certain ways that the company doesn't necessarily have to double for the stock to do well. With that said, it's a very big company. As it stands, it's still just an ad play. Now, I say "just" -- it's a massive market opportunity. But, we've seen how far Google has gotten thus far with it, and that's pretty far. Facebook has already caught up to it, more or less. So, looking out forward, it's a bit of a reach to say this is a no-brainer winner, but I think it's a pretty steady-eddy holding that you could hang on to for a while. Greer: Guys, it was a good day for Darden Restaurants. Shares up big on Tuesday on better than expected earnings and news that Darden's would buy Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Gross: That's a good name. Greer: Ron, that's a great name, it's such a great name. We should also mention that Darden's owns Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse, among others. Gross: Capital Grille, my favorite. That's a good one. Greer: Capital Grille. What do you think? Gross: The company is doing good, and a lot of restaurants are not. The results were pretty impressive, just shy of a 1% same store sales across the board. The highlight was Eddie V's, their seafood concept, at a 4.7% same-store sales increase. That's pretty impressive. Olive Garden, where most of their profits come from, and Steve Broido's favorite, of course, for listeners of the radio show, up 1.4%. So, not too shabby either, especially when you look out across the competition and see there's a lot of folks that are struggling right now. Profits were up strong. They increased guidance. Then, as you said, a $780 million acquisition of Cheddar Scratch, 165 locations across 28 states. It's a value chain. Let me hit you with some menu items. Perhaps I could interest you in some baby back ribs or some chicken fingers. Maybe J-Mo would like a Monte Cristo sandwich. Greer: Chicken-fried steak. Gross: Nothing wrong with that. Greer: Chicken-fried steak, Ron. Gross: Well, there's a lot wrong with that.  Greer: [laughs] Bite your tongue! Gross: [laughs] But, this is nice. They're adding a casual dining chain to their portfolio. I like that move. It's hard to say whether or not the $780 million is a good price, because I don't have a lot of financials on this company. We know that they've grown revenue 12% to 15% over the last 10 years. Not too shabby. That sounds good to me. Darden does say it will be accretive to their earnings pretty quickly. That's nice to see as well. Darden doing well. Moser: I continue to be amazed by the performance of Olive Garden's to-go side of the business. It's not a top of mind when I'm looking for something to go. But they have clearly hit on something here. The performance there, it's continued double-digit growth in the to-go segment of the business that's just, I'm astounded. Gross: I've never used it personally. I wonder if Steve has. Moser: I don't remember the last time I went to an Olive Garden, but obviously, a lot of people are going. I think a big catalyst for Darden was when they spun off a lot of the real estate that they owned into Four Corners Property Trust. They had a lot of restaurants in there where they owned the real estate. Basically, they were trying to whittle down their cost structure and just be a really good operator of restaurants. So, they spun off a lot of that property to this property trust. I think it helps shore up the balance sheet. I think it helped them focus on doing one thing and doing really well, and that is bringing a number of good, middle of the road brand names into their universe, and being able to grow those footprints. Again, kind of like that Facebook strategy. Whether you're going to one of these restaurants, you're still going to a Darden restaurant at the end of the day. And that's very good for them. Greer: And I want to go back to the name. I think Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen -- Gross: It's pretty good. Greer: I think that's the greatest name. I think the worst name is Carl's Jr. We still don't know how Carl came into possession of Jr. Because it's Carl's Jr. Gross: It's like Ruth's Chris. Greer: Oh, that's terrible! Gross: Yeah, it's hard to say. Greer: That was some mash up of someone who was married, and then they're not, but, Carl's Jr.? Gross: Cheddar's Scratch does it. Greer: It's confusing. I don't want to be confused. I just want food. Gross: I just want baby back ribs. You just want chicken-fried steak? Greer: You don't like chicken-fried steak? Gross: No, I do, but it's not the healthiest piece of food. Greer: Oh, and all the other items were, I'm sorry. Ron Gross, picture of health. Gross: Smothered in that white gravy, that unidentifiable white gravy. Greer: That's why it's good. We wrap up with tough time for Whole Foods. According to a report from Barclays, Whole Foods traffic has fallen by 14 million customers over the last year and half. That's a 3% drop. I should add that Whole Foods co-founder and CEO John Mackey is on the board of directors of the Motley Fool. Jason, according to the report, Kroger is the big beneficiary. Nearly half of Kroger stores are within three miles of a Whole Foods. Moser: Yeah, it was pretty smart to do that, huh? I guess maybe they felt like they were on to something. This goes back to what we've been talking about a lot in this space. Scale is really a tremendous advantage. Having that big footprint, where you can get things from point A to point B in the quickest fashion, and really carry a very wide selection of offerings, both private branded and brand names, is immensely advantageous. I think what we always wondered with Whole Foods for a time was, would they be able to get rid of that Whole Paychecks moniker that they had earned. It seemed like they were doing a pretty good job of that. They were making that way toward offering more 365 branded items, which certainly were more affordable. And I think that attracted more customers, for a time. But they really have run into a buzzsaw here in that every grocery store concept in the country is copying that model now, and bringing more and more naturals and organics into their mix. And furthermore, we talked about this, Whole Foods doesn't really do a very good job of attracting the crossover consumer. So, they don't have a lot of what people really still want. And that's a big problem, because now you're telling me I have to go to more than one place to get everything. Greer: Yeah, I don't want to do that. Gross: That was always, though. You would go to a regular supermarket for your paper towels and household items. Then, if you wanted organics or really good produce or really good meat and fish, you would pop over to Whole Foods. Two trips. Kind of annoying. Now, Kroger's brand, Harris Teeter, you get a lot of that right there. Now, I do not think the quality of the produce in the meats are the same at Harris Teeter and Whole Foods. Whole Foods still does a better job. If I have a dinner party, I'm still going to Whole Foods. But on a regular, weekly basis, it becomes less necessary to go to Whole Foods, which is never good for a business model. Moser: No. Greer: So, what does this mean if you're Whole Foods investor, or you're someone who's looking at the stock? Gross: I am a Whole Foods investor, and I'm not that thrilled about it lately. Even over the last five years, the stock is down around 30%. In my head, it was a more recent decline. But they've really been on the downturn for quite some time. I'm not a seller yet. To be honest, I'm not sure why I'm not. It's because I like the experience, I'm a consumer and I shop there, and I'll continue to support it as a shareholder. Greer: And you have lunch there a lot. Gross: I have lunch there almost every day. [laughs]  Greer: So, they have their prepared foods, some of the stores have bars now, so they have some built-in advantages, right? Gross: They do. I remain a loyal customer, and therefore, for now, I remain a loyal shareholder as well. Moser: I don't know. I'm not a Whole Foods investor. We did own shares of Whole Foods in Million Dollar Portfolio, but we sold them a little while back. I think really, the icing on the cake for us was in the most recent quarter, when they finally came to reality here in that they needed to pull back on what they saw as their full market opportunity. For a while, they were targeting 1,200 total stores around the country, which, we felt like, was too many. They, I think, now realize that that's too many. They pulled back on that guidance. They put that 365 store concept on hold to reasses which way they want to go with it. Right now, they're talking about going back to their roots and really focusing on that core Whole Foods customer that helped get them to this point today. It's almost like saying they're going back to that Whole Paychecks moniker. They're going back to targeting that consumer. Honestly, that probably is their best bet. I think we've come to a point where we realize, Whole Foods isn't going to be able to grow as much as a lot of people thought it was going to. So, maybe their best bet is to be that high-end grocer that focuses on a smaller overall market opportunity, but serves that market opportunity in an excellent fashion. And if they do that, it can certainly still perform well, possibly even see margins get back to expanding if they're able to keep on raising those prices a little bit. Because, for the last few years, they really have been focusing on value, to the extent that you would get it even on the grocery bags. If you have your grocery bags from Whole Foods you would see on the bags that they were talking about daily deals and value offerings and all this stuff. They were getting down to having to compete on pricing with all of these other bigger competitors out there. They can't win that game. They're too small to do it. So, then you have to wonder, really, is the path to success here some type of an acquisition? Do they need to acquire something like a Publix to grow that market opportunity and focus on a number of different tiers? Sprouts, a company that just went public shortly ago, a competitor to Whole Foods, sounds like they may be acquired by Albertsons, which also owns Safeway. So, you can certainly see consolidation in this sector. I think Whole Foods is more than likely going to have to either make an acquisition of some sort, or they are really going to be focusing just on that whole paycheck customer, and accepting the fact that they can only become so big. Greer: I'm not saying it would have been a perfect fit, but I think Whole Foods should have gone after Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Gross: I knew you were going to say that! That's awesome.

Hate-filled videos mislead children, poison the online experience for everyone, and serve as an unfortunate, yet effective, tool to recruit new generations of violent extremists. Now, ADL is seeing the impact of its efforts on online hate videos: Google, including its subsidiary YouTube, and virtually all other major online video sites have developed policies, employed teams, and put technologies in place to tackle the problem of online hate. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Twitter Gives Online Hate Speech Its Biggest Platform — Why? Lilly MaierOctober 18, 2016 Major brands — including Starbucks, Walmart, PepsiCo, AT&T, Verizon, Volkswagen and Johnson & Johnson — recently joined ADL in the condemnation of online hate, and they did it in a public way that shines a light on the problem and should dramatically impact Google’s bottom line. These advertisers pulled their ads from YouTube because Google’s ad placement algorithms allowed ads of these brands to appear before hate videos. The Times of London estimates Google stands to lose a whopping $750 million in annual revenue as a result of the pulled advertising. Google has acknowledged the need for improvement when it comes to the placement of ads on hate videos, though the company suggests, in the vast majority of cases, its policies work as intended. Google reportedly spends millions of dollars and employs thousands of people to stop bad advertising practices. Last year, it said it removed nearly two billion “bad ads” and prevented 300 million others from showing up on YouTube. ADL is sympathetic to Google’s problem. The scale of the problem is immense. There are millions of sites in its network, and 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every single minute. Google says it’s close to eliminating the placement of “bad ads.” But for the advertisers abandoning Google en masse because of mistaken ad placements, close is not good enough. ADL is eager, as we have in the past, to work with Google on this next chapter of the fight against online hate. We caution against overreaction and hope legitimate free expression is not affected by new filtering approaches. Determining what is and what is not hate speech is often a nuanced exercise that cannot be left entirely to artificial intelligence. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Google ‘Responsible’ for Dissemination of Holocaust Denial Dan FriedmanDecember 11, 2016 The current crisis is an opportune time for Google and other online companies to consider innovative approaches to the problem. Years ago, when a search of the term “Jew” on Google returned the website of a virulently anti-Semitic website, Google placed an ADL ad alongside the search result so users could access information on anti-Semitism and hate speech. A similar approach is necessary in this new world of online video hate. Since the advent of the internet, ADL has encouraged online platforms to take online hate seriously. The recent episode with Google shows that others, including major corporations, share ADL’s serious concern. The time to develop new solutions to combat this pernicious problem is now.

ANGELO MERENDINO/AFP/Getty Images reader comments 187 Share this story A former Google engineer, now working for Uber, used his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination this week. He did so to avoid turning over documents in the Waymo v. Uber trade-secret litigation. Anthony Levandowski, the head of Uber's self-driving car project, took the extraordinary step during a closed court hearing on Wednesday. Levandowski's lawyer said his client won't be turning over any documents because there's a "potential for criminal action." The reports emerged because transcripts of the hearing were acquired by news organizations, including The New York Times, Reuters, and USA Today.  Google has accused Levandowski of downloading 14,000 "highly confidential" files from Google while he worked there, 9.7 gigabytes in total. Six weeks after the alleged downloads, Levandowski resigned and later started his own self-driving truck startup. That company, Otto, was acquired by Uber for $680 million. Further ReadingGoogle’s Waymo sues Uber, alleging theft of trade secretsThat led Google's Waymo division to file a lawsuit against Uber last month. During yesterday's hearing, Waymo asked for an injunction that would stop Uber from using any of the intellectual property at question. That injunction could put a hold on Uber's self-driving car project. US District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the litigation, told Uber lawyers that it will be hard for them to avoid an injunction if Levandowski, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, doesn't hand over the documents at issue. "If you think for a moment that I'm going to stay my hand because your guy is taking the Fifth Amendment and not issue a preliminary injunction to shut down that... you're wrong," Alsup said, according to Reuters. Uber attorneys said they want to see Levandowski testify. During the hearing, Uber lawyer Arturo Gonzalez said that Levandowski, has been told to release any relevant documents needed in discovery. "Obviously, we have a conflict," Gonzalez told the judge, according to The New York Times. “Got himself in a fix” Uber would be handing over documents that were "responsive to the Court's order," Gonzalez said. Alsup didn't care for that answer. "That's a cleverly worded thing," the judge told Uber's lawyer, according to USA Today. "I didn't just fall off the turnip truck... That means you're not going to produce everything." Gonzalez explained that Uber wasn't in possession of all the documents mentioned in the Waymo complaint. That's when Alsup asked if Levandowski had the rest of the documents—a question Levandowski refused to answer. Levandowski's lawyer said his client won't be testifying about "the existence, location, or possession of any responsive documents." The decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment could change as they look at the case more closely, said Levandowski's lawyer, Miles Ehrlich. Waymo has sued Uber for trade-secret theft as well as patent infringement. Uber has asked for the trade-secret matters to go forward in binding arbitration, rather than a trial. "At least it's not in public where it's going to be on the front page of The New York Times the next day," said Gonzalez. Alsup rejected that argument and said the public has a right to know about the case. "I'm sorry that Mr. Levandowski has got his—got himself in a fix," said Alsup, according to the Reuters report on the transcript. "That's what happens, I guess, when you download 14,000 documents and take them, if he did. But I don't hear anybody denying that." In response to press inquiries, Uber associate general counsel Angela Padilla said the company is looking forward to making its own case next week, when its public response is due in court.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Getty Creative Google is already your go-to for, well, pretty much everything, but now, the mega search engine is about to become your source for booking any and all the fitness classes that your heart (and your body) want. The tech giant has officially launched Reserve with Google, a new platform that allows users to seek out and book classes nearby. The feature was previously tested in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, but now, group-fitness aficionados nationwide can take advantage of the tool. It seamlessly integrates with scheduling partners Mindbody, Appointy, Front Desk, Full Slate, Genbook, and MyTime to make booking truly a cinch. Reserve with Google's interface features an easy-to-use search bar up top, followed by personalized recommendations straight from the search experts, in addition to tiles with suggested themed workouts (such as "Pilates Before Work" or "Dancing Friday Night"). Clicking on any of the items will take users to a list (or, on a desktop, an integrated list-map feature), which showcases the name of each studio and available class, where each studio is located, the cost of the class, and a class description and user rating—so you'll know exactly what you're getting yourself into before you sign up. To book, users can enter their information or take advantage of their preloaded info with Google with just a few clicks. To make your life that much easier, the whole thing feeds into your Google Calendar, so you can spend more time sweating and less time scheduling. It seems that this is just the beginning of Google's foray into fitness. According to a spokesperson, Reserve with Google will continue to refine the way it makes recommendations so you can count on a great workout every time. "We make recommendations based on courses you've taken, and will be exploring more ways to bring timely and useful recommendations to fitness buffs," a Google spokesperson told Cosmopolitan. "For example, you will soon be able to get notifications of new classes that might be interesting to you."

Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 A bunch of healthcare startups is going beyond plain vanilla doctor appointments by identifying unserved niches, ET finds out:​ CREDIHEALTH: Going for Second Opinion Ravi Virmani was made to believe that only porn, ecommerce and stocks are searched on internet in India. The perception, he asserts, proved to be erroneous when he rolled out Credihealth, an online platform that allows patients to compare and select hospitalisation process, in January 2014. For Virmani, who worked as the chief executive of Max Healthcare for over three years, the trigger for starting a healthcare startup was the need for people to take a second opinion. Many a time, he says, due to lack of right information and transparency, people are misguided and overcharged for medical services. Prevalence of unethical practices in healthcare delivery — touts, misguidance, referrals by family doctors increasing bills by 35-40% — also made him to think of an alternative platform for patients. “I wanted to bring transparency in healthcare system,” contends Virmani. It raised an undisclosed amount from Twitter India director of engineering Rajat Malhotra last September. Present in 15 cities, Credihealth plans to expand its reach to 45 in two years. “80% of Indians are not insured, and even those who are have to shell out extra,” he says, adding that perception that big hospital chains tend to overcharge by prescribing unrequired tests can be addressed by taking a second opinion. * Provides in-house medical experts who act as personal medical assistant * Online platform allows patients to compare and select hospitalisation process * Started in January 2014; raised an undisclosed amount last September SURGIVISOR : A Stitch In Time Surgery is a dreaded word, and Sumeet Khanna wanted to take the fear out of the word and the process. Surgivisor, he claims, is helping in bridging the gap between patients and hospitals. Started in January last year, Surgivisor assists people in choosing the right hospital and doctor for surgeries by streamlining the entire process. Khanna, cofounder of Surgivisor, explains how the online healthcare platform provides information on relevant procedures, hospitals, specialist doctors and surgeons, cost of surgery, insurance and location preferences. From answering a small query to understanding the patient’s complete requirement and initiating the treatment takes not more than 30 minutes, he adds. The biggest challenge, Khanna reckons, lies in constantly providing correct and reliable information on procedures, hospitals and doctors to patients, along with that on the most cost-effective and customised service and support track record. “We need to maintain highest degree of professional standards and excellence at all times,” he says. Revenue comes from marketing and development fees from partner hospitals. Though the task looks easy, challenges were galore. Apart from data collection, mining, mapping and search optimisation, sensitising people on making informed decision was equally daunting. Currently present in Delhi-NCR. The startup is planning to expand to Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai. * Assists patients to choose the right hospital and doctor for surgeries * Launched in January 2016; raised $1 m the same month * Provides database of more than 350 hospitals, 6,000 doctors and 1,500 surgeries CELES CARE : Right Dose of Virtual Reality Raghu Bathina knew he could easily fill the huge gap existed between ‘Dr. Google’ and a hospital visit. While Dr. Google — the habit to hunt for health-related queries on Google — is free, convenient and informative, it’s equally inconclusive and confusing. A hospital visit, on the other hand, is not only inconvenient and expensive, it’s non-empowering and there is no continuity between visits. Enter Celes Care, India’s first virtual health clinic for women. “We are as easy to access as Google and as qualified as a doctor in the hospital,” says Bathina, who cofounded the company with Dr Rajah Koppala in August last year. Celes has a team of 15 medical professionals and plans to scale it up to 40 this year. The trigger, explains Bathina, for starting Celes Care was lack of access of affordable primary healthcare to women. According to a recent Nielsen global survey, Indian women happened to be most stressed. An overwhelming 87% of them felt stressed most of the time, and 82% had no time to relax. The primary healthcare segment, says Bathina, is still untapped, and there is a huge potential. “We also plan to work alongside large corporates and insurance providers and be a one-stop solution for women’s health needs,” he says. * India’s first virtual health clinic for women * Provides online consultation over chat, voice and video * Launched in August 2016; raised $1.5 m in a pre-series A round this February Also read: ​ Small town consumers drive online luxury sales KONSULT : Your Instant Medical Consultant More than half of all medical followups, says Anshul Mittal, can be done remotely without the patient being physically present. “The patient-not-present (PNP) market is a huge opportunity,” says cofounder of Konsult, a tele-consultation platform rolled out in June 2015. Traditionally, the only channel left for patients was to schedule another OPD visit even for minor or simple follow-up queries, says Mittal. This, in turn, leads to patients falling out in the follow-up period and ignoring their health due to constraints of time and money, and sometimes general lethargy. “We do not even bother to finish the course of medicine once we start to recover,” says Mittal, and not doing the follow up could lead to serious repercussions. Tele consultations turn out to be cheaper than visiting a hospital because the patient pays based on the duration of the call and also saves time and opportunity cost. Since May 2016, when Konsult rolled out a new version of the app, it has on boarded 1,200 specialist doctors and served more than 25,000 patients. This year, it launched a user concierge and doctor recommendation service which provides localised advice on best doctors, treatments and costs. Indian healthcare system, he points out, is so saturated that personal patient care is almost negligible. “We want to change that,” he says. * Allows users to consult their choice of doctors without prior appointments * Provides second opinion in case of chronic and serious ailments * Formed in June 2015; raised two rounds of seed funding MAYA: Taking Care of Menstrual Hygiene John Paul talks on the basis of numbers. In India, he says, about 70% of all reproductive diseases are caused by poor menstrual hygiene. There are 355 million women of reproductive age in India who need structures in place to meet their menstrual needs. That’s where and why Maya comes into the picture. Launched in India last year, Maya helps women track their menstrual cycles, related symptoms and other vital health information and gives them valuable insights based on the tracked data. Taking advantage of smartphone coverage in even the remote corners of India, Maya aims to equip women to manage their menstrual health using a mobile phone, says Paul, who first launched Maya globally in 2012 and has had over 7 million downloads so far. “Women can also use Maya to increase accuracy of contraception and conception,” says Paul. It helps women with the knowledge and support to understand how their fertility works and enables them to take ownership of their reproductive health. According to research done by the startup, almost half the women in India have irregular menstrual cycles, which, if untreated, could lead to health issues such as infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome (a disorder causing enlarged ovaries with small cysts on the outer edges). Menstrual hygiene, Paul says, is one of the most important, yet neglected, health issues. The startup recently launched Maya in Hindi and Tamil and plans to cover more regional languages soon. * Helps women track menstrual cycles, related symptoms and other vital health information * Launched in India last year; raised money from Prime Venture and Google’s Rajan Anandan * Recorded 7 m+ downloads worldwide; is present in 12 foreign languages AFFORDPLAN : Plan Your Hospital Bills What if hospitals provide you a tailored solution to plan, save and pay for non-emergency medical procedures such as those related to pregnancy, eyecare, dental, plastic surgeries, orthopedic, bariatric, genetic testing and so on? That’s what Affordplan does. It allows people to save on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, as per their chosen plan, and then make regular payments either by online transfer or depositing money at hospitals, or patients can avail of pickup services directly from the comfort of their home. Reports by insurance regulator, points out cofounder Tejbir Singh, indicate that less than 20% of Indians have health cover. Other numbers are equally shocking. More than 300 million Indians, earning Rs 2-10 lakh a year, struggle to get quality medical care. Liquidity constraints prevent a number of patients from paying a lump sum amount at the time of hospital admission, adds Singh, who started Affordplan in December 2015 and piloted the service in May last year. “Affordplan is bridging this gap between the patients and hospitals by enabling hospitals to offer customised financial solutions to patients,” he says. It is present in more than 120 hospitals in Delhi-NCR and patients can avail of benefits at OPD visits, follow-on checkups and diagnostics related to treatment. The startup, which gets a transaction fee from hospitals, plans to expand to three more cities over next year. * Offers solutions on savings for nonemergency medical services, including upcoming medical procedures * Started in Dec 2015; raised Rs 20 cr in a Series A round last November * Present in over 120 hospitals in Delhi-NCR, plans to expand into three cities over the next year Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. By Lucian Constantin Romania Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 31, 2017 11:32 AM PT Credit: Magdalena Petrova More like this Mobile security firm offers cash to hackers for their old exploits Pwn2Own hacking contest ends with two virtual machine escapes Bug Bounties: Why Paying Hackers Makes You Safer Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key Six months ago, Google offered to pay US$200,000 to any researcher who could remotely hack into an Android device by knowing only the victim's phone number and email address. No one stepped up to the challenge. While that might sound like good news and a testament to the mobile operating system's strong security, that's likely not the reason why the company's Project Zero Prize contest attracted so little interest. From the start, people pointed out that $200,000 was too low a prize for a remote exploit chain that wouldn't rely on user interaction. "If one could do this, the exploit could be sold to other companies or entities for a much higher price," one user responded to the original contest announcement in September. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] "Many buyers out there could pay more than this price; 200k not worth for finding needle under haystack," said another. Google was forced to acknowledge this, noting in a blog post this week that "the prize amount might have been too low considering the type of bugs required to win this contest." Other reasons that might have led to the lack of interest, according to the company's security team, might be the high complexity of such exploits and the existence of competing contests where the rules were less strict. In order to gain root or kernel privileges on Android and fully compromise a device, an attacker would have to chain multiple vulnerabilities together. At the very least, they would need a flaw that would allow them to remotely execute code on the device, for example within the context of an application, and then a privilege escalation vulnerability to escape the application sandbox. Judging by Android's monthly security bulletins, there's no shortage of privilege escalation vulnerabilities. However, Google wanted for exploits submitted as part of this contest to not rely on any form of user interaction. This means the attacks should have worked without users clicking on malicious links, visiting rogue websites, receiving and opening files, and so on. This rule significantly restricted the entry points that researchers could use to attack a device. The first vulnerability in the chain would have had to be located in the operating system's built-in messaging functions like SMS or MMS, or in the baseband firmware -- the low-level software that controls the phone's modem and which can be attacked over the cellular network. One vulnerability that would have met these criteria was discovered in 2015 in a core Android media processing library called Stagefright, with researchers from mobile security firm Zimperium finding the vulnerability. The flaw, which triggered a large coordinated Android patching effort at the time, could have been exploited by simply placing a specially crafted media file anywhere on the device's storage. One way to do that involved sending a multimedia message (MMS) to targeted users and didn't require any interaction on their part. Merely receiving such a message was enough for successful exploitation. Many similar vulnerabilities have since been found in Stagefright and in other Android media processing components, but Google changed the default behavior of the built-in messaging apps to no longer retrieve MMS messages automatically, closing that avenue for future exploits. "Remote, unassisted, bugs are rare and require a lot of creativity and sophistication," said Zuk Avraham, founder and chairman of Zimperium, via email. They're worth much more than $200,000, he said. An exploit acquisition firm called Zerodium is also offering $200,000 for remote Android jailbreaks, but it doesn't put a restriction on user interaction. Zerodium sells the exploits it acquires to their customers, including to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. So why go to the trouble of finding rare vulnerabilities to build fully unassisted attack chains when you can get the same amount of money -- or even more on the black market -- for less sophisticated exploits? "Overall, this contest was a learning experience, and we hope to put what we’ve learned to use in Google’s rewards programs and future contests," Natalie Silvanovich, a member of Google's Project Zero team, said in the blog post. To that end, the team is expecting comments and suggestions from security researchers, she said. It's worth mentioning that despite this apparent failure, Google is a bug bounty pioneer and has run some of the most successful security reward programs over the years covering both its software and online services. There's little chance that vendors will ever be able to offer the same amount of money for exploits as criminal organizations, intelligence agencies, or exploit brokers. Ultimately, bug bounty programs and hacking contests are aimed at researchers who have an inclination toward responsible disclosure to begin with.

Google explains why the Android Wear 2.0 rollout was delayed for some watches Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/30 9:44am PDTMar 30, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 32 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 Android Wear News You might have heard about Valve Time - the tendency for video game company Valve to release games and features long after the intended date. Google is also guilty of this, with apps and features still rolling out weeks after being announced. Many Android Wear users were left wondering why their watches had not received the much-anticipated 2.0 update weeks after the rollout supposedly started, but know we know why. Google has confirmed to Wareable.com that the update was delayed to fix a bug. We haven't asked Google ourselves, but this is the statement provided by Wareable: "We have started rolling out the Android Wear 2.0 update to Fossil Q Founder, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10 and Tag Heuer Connected. For other devices, the update is currently being delayed due to a bug found in final testing. We will push the update to the remaining devices as soon as the issue is resolved." Considering Android Wear 2.0 was initially slated for a late 2016 release, and was even delayed, it's rather annoying that all the bugs were not properly ironed out already. But pushing a buggy update to users probably wouldn't have worked out very well. Source: Wareable Tags android wear android wear 2.0 bug delayed rollout subscribe ...

Morten Ulv How would developers have their aps ready? Morten Ulv How would developers have their apps ready? :) Đức Thành It's nothing serious, but this is just another example of poor planning. Please don't turn this into a habit, Google. I love Google, but honestly nobody wants to hear your excuses when you are doing business. Especially when all of this could be solved very easily if you just wait until the final product is ready *before* announcing a release date. demarcmj It's already become a habit. Đức Thành Worse, it might become an addiction. mattcoz Stop being ridiculous, if they planned for the possibility of bugs then it would never get released. Nothing is ever released completely free of bugs. They never announced a date for the update of older devices. Đức Thành I was being very reasonable, in fact. You are correct that it is nearly impossible to plan for the possibility of bugs, but that wasn't the point. The point is Google should learn how to do estimations more accurately, and move the release date to a more appropriate time, preferably later than how they usually do it. If you are going to release it late anyway (and this has happened a bunch of times, there's no reason Google can't learn from it), why not announce the ETA a little bit later and take more time to prepare, instead of making the service users wait in anticipation? There is always unknown risks and it's probably not possible yet to account for all the possibilities things could go wrong, but risks are something that can be managed. NexusMan It was announced 2 weeks ago I'd get it by the end of this month...And I got it yesterday. Đức Thành Well that's not too bad then? I was making the comments based on the observation that Google missed the deadline they set for themselves for some of the devices. Two questions though: What is your device and does the timely update for your device also apply for all other devices? Actually, if the answer to that last question is "no," I've got one more question: Have you read the article? (Not trying to be rude or anything, just curious.) NexusMan In February, in a blog post, Google announced "Android Wear 2.0 will be available for all supported watches in the coming weeks." Still not sure what your complaint is. Yesterday was "the coming weeks" from February and unless the world ends, there are still more weeks to come. mattcoz The point is, no matter how long they wait to there is a chance something will crop up afterwards. It happens, that's why it's only an estimate. Đức Thành The point is Google can learn to make better estimations. NexusMan You're right. They should just do like Samsung and release devices that catch on fire. Rush everything...Software, devices and batteries to market. Who cares if it's ready? Đức Thành If that was sarcasm, I think you might have missed my point. To clarify, my point wasn't for Google to "release products on time according to the announced ETA," but to "make sure most of the preparation for the product launch are well taken care of *and then* announce an ETA for the products." Whether there was a misunderstanding or I not, I hope I have made it clear. NexusMan I didn't miss your point. My point is stuff happens. Frawlz You would have thought this is what the beta was for...... Stephen Cornwell Until it's released it's still pre-release software, as the quote says the bud we was found in final testing we're talking about a release candidate, which is where bugs are found. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Bugs are found at every stage. Even after release. With each phase a wider range of devices are exposed to the software raising the likelihood for a bug to surface. JD With Google its always beta Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Popular opinion is that the bug is Qualcomm/SnapDragon related, hence the earlier release of the update for Intel chipset watches: Fossil, Tag Heuer, Casio. The other guess is that this bug has something to do with battery drain or faulty power management, something some of the new LG watches (Sport, Style) seem to suffer from. Still, using the Dev Preview on my Huawei Watch I haven't experienced any bad battery, I still get around 1.5 days with always on screen and tilt to wake using my own watch-face/launcher. Corbin Davenport Maybe, the Polar M600 is also getting the update now, and it has a MediaTek processor. Matt Mine isn't. I contacted Polar the other day and support said they had no new news about when it was going out. Matt "We were told it was going to be released mid to late March. Unfortunately we don't have an ETA on that release data but it should be very soon." That was March 22. Matt Of course now I see the latest article. Nicholas Polydor BTW, @corbin_davenport , the site is Wareable.com not Wearable.com (not that I'm sure why they spelt it that way, mind!) TheJester Polar comfirmed me the update until end of next week on twitter. Rob Smith I have Polar M600, and I got update last night! Andy Webber Could be something introduced after the last beta. mattcoz Most likely the case, and they were probably focused on testing for the SD2100 leading up to the release. Jordan L Solid analysis. Also, I get about 1.5days on my Huawei Watch w/ Dev Preview, using a WatchMaker face too. King_Android "We found a bug, that we are trying to iron out" = The quickest way to stop us nerds from complaining so much. demarcmj Google was good at updating stuff when they only had a few devices to worry about. They have been progressively becoming worse and worse as the amount of "stuff" to manage has grown. This "bug" non-explanation is the same excuse they gave for making Nexus 6 users wait on 7.0. In that case, as well as this, there was a lengthy beta program that is ostensibly supposed to be used to iron out the bugs. mattcoz That's generally how it works, and no beta period ever irons out all the bugs. kenspiracy Honestly, with everything I've heard about how AW2.0 handles notifications, I'm not even sure I want the update on my Moto 360. Leonardo Baez If it is 1st gen it wont update kenspiracy It's not. Stephen Cornwell I've been running it for months, the notifications are much better than 1.0. jstew182 I have been searching for a while now trying to find a good video showing how notifications work on 2.0. Does the name of the person still stay at the bottom of the screen when they message you or does it show an icon or what? thespacecowboy How about not launching a product/release until it's ready? This was updated/posted early February, nearly two months ago. https://developer.android.com/wear/index.html Middlefinger Dont be daft, this is Google we are talking about. mattcoz Maybe the bug didn't present itself until after the release when testing on older hardware. Đức Thành Sorry but that's not an explanation, that's an excuse. Then why not test the software on those older hardware? mattcoz That's when the bug appeared, during testing. jubby2000 Wareable* Mitch Brown I am all for Google doing quality control. I would rather wait longer and get something that works. Anyone who has run a Windows based system knows what working with bugs in the system is like. That's what I like about Android, I experience very few problems working with Android or Chrome OS. Can't say the same for Windows 10. Aditya Singh I have fossil q founder 2.0. When will my watch get android wear 2 ? George Garrett Must be a serious bug. Huawei replaced my Nexus 6p after they said the Android 7.0 update nuked a third of my battery capacity; and that was an actual release. The wear 2.0 update must've done something terrible. Stoneule Hilarious. Once again Google is finding ways to destroy Android Wear. Incredible really. In fact is there anything from io2016 that wasn't a complete disaster? I'll say it for the 100th time, get rid of Sundar. Google needs new leadership JD Oh Google no one cares for your BS excuses. You're not a startup anymore. Nick Coad Cool, now explain to me why the LG Sport and LG Style are so shit. NexusMan Because they're made by LG. Teja Seriously, Android Wear is where Google is not good enough to compete with Samsung Gear both in terms of battery life and software experience. Sad. roflcopter pilot delays happen. unfortunately so does shitty communication. Sean Thomas AW 2.0 announced at IO 2016....just going to be rolling out to devices by IO 2017. Good job Google lmao. Rob Smith I got AW 2.0 for M600 TODAY! Martin Buerkle Yeah big bummer. I got the 2nd Gen Moto 360 and got it because It seemed to be getting the update on schedule. And the new Google Sport of course was sold out day one and the thickness is really ugly. Hopefully Google gets their act together, many products and apps are suffering from human incompetence.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Google eclipses Apple as most valuable brand of 2017 Brand Finance has released its list of the 100 most valuable American brands, and there’s a new No. 1. Google has taken the top spot from Apple. It’s now considered not only the country’s most valuable brand, but the world’s, as well. The company held the top spot previously in 2011. Its brand value is pegged at $109 billion. Brands are assed on a variety of factors, including “what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand.” Part of Google’s rise to the top is the stagnation of Apple’s technological innovation and branding efforts. Brand Finance explains in a press release: 2017 has already delivered one major shock to the branding world: Apple has seen nearly $40 billion wiped off its brand value. Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers by failing to maintain its technological advantage and delivering tweaks to existing products rather than genuine innovation. Brand value has fallen 27% since early 2016 to $107 billion, meaning that for the first time in over five years, America (and the world) has a new most valuable brand. Other brands have been hit with negative public perception as consumers turn toward healthier eating choices, and reject fast food, soda and sugar. Brand Finance says: Coca-Cola’s brand value was $43.1bn in 2007, making it the most valuable brand in America and the wider world. Today, however, its brand value now stands at just $31.8bn, putting it 16th in the US and 27 th internationally. Increasing concerns over the links between carbonated drinks and obesity have begun to undermine what the Coca-Cola brand has represented for over one hundred years. Pepsi is similarly suffering, falling 4% to $18.3 billion. The same trend is evident in the fast food industry. The brand values of McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Subway and Domino’s have all fallen due to heavy competition in an increasingly fragmented market, with healthier challenger brands offering greater choice for consumers.

Here are the top 10: 1. Google 2. Apple 3. Amazon.com 4. AT&T 5. Microsoft 6. Verizon 7. Walmart 8. Facebook 9. Wells Fargo 10.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile New Pixel Launcher Brings Back The Good Old Google Search Bar By Zara Ali Mar 30, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Google launched the Pixel smartphones with Pixel Launcher, which was a significant overhaul from the regular Google search bar. It came with a design that featured Google “pill” widget on the left and the weather and date widget on the right. In the latest development, it looks like some Pixel users have started a seeing a new Pixel Launcher on their phone, and it seems like Google is retracing the past designs. The new design of the Pixel Launcher was first spotted by the folks at Android Police. The report by them states that in the new design, Google has removed weather and date widget and reinstated the Google search bar again that takes up the major chunk of space on the home screen. Related Samsung’s Galaxy S8 App Drawer Launcher Looks Highly Inspired By Pixel Launcher Advertisement There is no statement from Google about these changes yet, but as simple as we can assume, we think that the tech giant did this to simplify the user experience. The Google search bar easier to use and is apparently preferred by the users too as they are accustomed to seeing it on their older Android phones. On the contrary, Pixel Launcher’s original design was rather complex that might not have appealed to many users. Google search bar on new Pixel Launcher is not the same old rectangular bar, it has slightly rounded edges now. Overall, the new design looks clutter free. Some Pixel users who got the update, have posted the images on Reddit and these images show how neat the new design looks. How to get the new Pixel Launcher now? For the Pixel users who want the Google search bar design on their phone right now, they can get it by cleaning the data in the Pixel Launcher app. Before you move ahead with that step, we would like to warn you that it will clear your customised home screen layouts as well. If you don’t want to lose your personalised layouts then we suggest that you wait for the update from Google’s side. Related Google Has a Very Irresponsible Attitude When It Comes to Restocking Its Pixel Lineup Google will gradually roll it out to all the Pixel phones. In the meatime, Pixel users can tell us if they preferred the old look or are happy to be treated to a redesign? Do you like the simple Google search bar instead of different widgets?

In anticipation of April Fools Day, Google has dropped its very own version of Ms. Pac-Man into Google Maps, allowing you to play the famous arcade title using real-world maps as the playing field. We’ve seen this before, but it doesn’t make it any less cool to see Ms. Pac-Man appear again. By hitting the Ms. Pac-Man button you see on the right of the screen, Google Maps will load a random area and dot the streets with pellets. You’ll need to navigate Ms. Pac-Man through these streets while you avoid the ghosts, with the ultimate goal of clearing the map by eating all of the pellets. If you spent countless hours in arcades back in the 1980s – or if you’ve played one of Pac-Man‘s numerous incarnations in the time since then – you already know the drill. Pac-Man Mania first started with the release of the original Pac-Man way back in 1980 and with it being almost an instant hit, it wasn’t long before Ms. Pac-Man was released in 1981. Obviously, playing on a mobile device within Google Maps leaves something to be desired if you’re used to arcade controls. You control Ms. Pac-Man by swiping the screen in the direction you want to turn, which isn’t quite as good as using a joystick for control. Still, if you’re a fan of classic arcade games, then pop open Google Maps and give its take of Ms. Pac-Man a spin.

March 31, 2017 13:53 ET Reshift Media Revolutionizes Facebook and Google Advertising for Multi-Location Businesses Newly Developed Brand Amplifier Software Enables Franchises, Retailers, and Restaurant Chains to Easily Create and Manage Localized Social and Search Advertising TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - March 31, 2017) - When it comes to Facebook and Google advertising, location marketing is the hottest trend. The focus of both social and search advertising has dramatically shifted to driving local engagement and store visits. However, when you're a multi-location business like a franchise, retailer or restaurant chain, it can be a challenge to easily localize your marketing strategy at a national level. Digital marketing and software development organization Reshift Media, which works with clients in 18 countries covering a wide array of industries, recognized that their multi-location clients did not have the tools they needed to take advantage of their inherent local strengths. To address this, Reshift developed the Brand Amplifier™ software, which enables national brands to use their physical store networks in conjunction with their Facebook and Google advertising to achieve superior results. Using the Brand Amplifier™, brands and agencies are able to create high-quality national campaigns that are automatically customized by each location to dramatically increase local targeting, relevancy and effectiveness. The software allows brands to manage all of their local Facebook and Google advertising in one easy-to-use dashboard and for local owners to customize their ads to suit their unique offers and audiences. "Having worked with many multi-location businesses, we saw that there was a real challenge with how they were able to manage their Facebook and Google advertising," said Steve Buors, CEO of Reshift Media. "Franchisors, retailers and other businesses with bricks-and-mortar locations have a local opportunity that other competitors can't match. Unfortunately, the tools available didn't allow these companies to take advantage of their inherent strengths: their staff's knowledge of their market and their connection to local audiences. The Brand Amplifier™ recognizes the power of these multi-location companies and puts it to work to achieve dramatically better results than any national campaign ever could." The Brand Amplifier™ allows the head office team to program a variety of ad options with high-quality, brand-approved imagery, text and targeting parameters, while local teams have the flexibility to choose which images or offers work best for their region and customize the copy to suit their local business objectives. The result is high-quality, localized Facebook and Google advertising that is far more effective than generic national messaging. Both national and local teams can contribute ad budget to the same search and social campaigns to focus efforts and maximize results. Consolidating efforts also cuts down on the possibility that head office and local franchisees are running competing ads and duplicating work. "We have been working with Reshift Media for several years now. With the Brand Amplifier™, we are able to control the quality of our advertising across both our corporate and franchise owned locations," said Brian Hibbard, President of South Beach Tanning Company. "Our local franchisees are able to use their marketing dollars wisely, while we feel confident that the creative and offers they are running are consistent and on-brand. It really is the best of national and local working together." The Brand Amplifier™, which will make its official debut at the Canadian Franchise Association's National Convention in Niagara Falls on April 3, is already being used by a number of national brands, including Dogtopia, Sears Hometown, Miracle Method, The UPS Store Canada, South Beach Tanning and Crock A Doodle, among others.

About Brand Amplifier™ The Brand Amplifier™ digital marketing dashboard is a cloud-based software application that has been specifically built for multi-location businesses such as franchises, retailers and restaurants, among others.

Like generations before them, these women break down barriers and defy expectations at work and in their communities. Over the course of the month, we’ll help you get to know a few of these Google women, and share a bit about who they are and why they inspire us. Today, we’re speaking with Sapna Kalmadi, a Senior Analytical Lead in our Mumbai office, known for her “take no prisoners” attitude when playing table tennis and “leave no chocolate” attitude when eating desserts. How do you explain your job at a dinner party? I act as a “Google consultant” for businesses in India and help large clients connect with their consumers using Google solutions. Ad revenue is what helps drive the cool things that Google is best known for, including Search, YouTube and self-driving cars. Why are you proud to be a woman at Google? I’m proud to be a woman at Google because of the amazing people I work with every day.. I’ve worked at Google for five years, and I have learned something from every single Googler I’ve met. I love the fact that diversity and inclusion at Google is not just an individual or HR initiative but rather there are employee resource groups like Women@Google, which actively works to connect and develop the women who work here. Thanks to Women@, I’ve had the opportunity to attend talks with women entrepreneurs and authors, have inclusion discussions with senior leaders and network with other women in tech. If you could ask one woman from history a question … who would it be and what would you ask? I would ask Mother Teresa about the key influences in her life and what drove her to devote her life to selfless service. What advice would you give to women starting out in their careers? Take on as many challenging, diverse opportunities as you can. Work in multicultural offices and interact with as many people as you can. Invest in self development so that you can keep learning and growing! How do you spend most of your time outside of work? I am an avid traveler and photographer. One of my personal goals is to travel to 30 countries by the time I’m 30—29 down, one to go. Travel and photography go hand in hand, and taking photos while I’m traveling gives me so much joy. One of my travel photographs even got featured in “Lonely Planet!” Sapna’s photograph in a “Lonely Planet” magazine Who is your favorite fictional heroine? Hermione Granger. Growing up, I loved the “Harry Potter” series. Hermione is not only an academic genius—she’s a courageous friend who proves herself in the most treacherous of situations. Never the damsel in distress, she’s always coming up with a way to save the day. I really liked the way her character progresses as she grows up—she starts out as the ever-too-keen student and grows into an intelligent young lady who helps overcome the final challenge. What is your life motto? I get my life motto from my family: “Que sera sera,” which means “whatever will be, will be.”     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on April 1, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: April 1, 2017 @ 7:13 am Filed Under: Business, Computer Technologies, Economics, English, Global Economy, Google, MIL OSI, MIL OSI Economics, Open Source Intel NEXT ARTICLE → Introducing Ms. PAC-Maps ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE No more time to noodle: meet the winner of the Doodle 4 Google competition!

Related Links 14 beautiful satellite time-lapse videos of Utah you have to see Building Legos in Google Maps You can now see TRAX, bus schedules in Apple Maps Those who want to fool around Friday may want to open their Google Maps app. According to The Verge, Google Maps updated its maps to include the game “Ms. Pac-Man.” All you have to do is open the app, click the pink button on the right side of the screen and bam, it’ll be there for you to play. Google previously turned its app into the traditional “Pac-Man” game in 2015, The Verge reported. This year’s version is a little different. You can’t turn your current coordinates into a spot in the game. Instead, the updated app puts you in a random spot somewhere in the world. It’s your job then to escape the ghosts chasing you, The Verge reported. But Heather Alexandra, of gaming news website Kotaku, said her app allows her to play within New York City. Comment on this story “I’m in New York. Everything is a grid here so it works really well. If you’re on winding backroads, it’ll be a bit harder. My recommendation for the best ‘Ms. Pac-Man’ experience is to zoom out far or head to a location with more roads,” she wrote. Those who want to use Google Maps on a desktop or laptop can also play the game, The Verge reported. Google usually waits until April 1 to roll out its prank. And since it’s already April Fools’ Day somewhere in the world, the game launched in middle of the day Mountain Time on Friday. Here’s what the game looks like in various Utah locations.

Columnist Eric Enge recaps a session from SMX West where audience members were able to ask Google anything. Eric Enge on March 31, 2017 at 12:01 pm More It always attracts a lot of attention when Googlers are up on stage and open for questioning. The Ask Me Anything (AMA) with Google Search at the recent SMX West conference was no exception. This panel, moderated by Danny Sullivan, featured two prominent Googlers: Webmaster Trends Analyst Gary Illyes and Webmaster Outreach Specialist Mariya Moeva. In this post, I’m going to recount the bulk of the questions asked, and the answers from Illyes and/or Moeva. Please note that responses have been summarized rather than directly quoted. Let’s get started! 1. Does Google maintain any metric along the lines of a “Domain Authority” concept? Gary Illyes: This is something that Google feels does not really work. For example, on blogspot.com, the user blogs created there really shouldn’t inherit the authority of the main domain. All ranking is page-specific. 2. What about subdomains? Illyes: No such thing as subdomain authority. Mariya Moeva: Before we get asked, I’ll add that there is no similar signal for folders, either. 3. Can you talk about the update called Fred? Illyes: We make tons of updates all the time, and this is not something we would have thought to name or announce. It only got a name because of an interaction on Twitter with Barry Schwartz. Google won’t communicate about what this particular update did, but you can find the things that it targeted if you carefully read all of the Webmaster guidelines. Unfortunately, we can’t say which particular ones. Moeva: One of the issues with naming updates is that people start attributing all sorts of things to those updates, even though they aren’t actually related. 4. When will Google stop ranking internal search pages? Why does this still work? Illyes: We do frown on these pages getting indexed, as they are not that useful for users. We do have algos that try to get rid of them, and for that matter not even crawl them, but sometimes these don’t catch everything, and we may have to manually intervene. Moeva: If you’re trying to get these pages out of the index for your site, you can use the parameter handling feature in Search Console to say, “Don’t look at these pages.” 5. What data does Google use to see the “also try” info in a Knowledge Panel? Illyes: Maybe we leverage the Knowledge Graph categories to find similar pages, but that’s just a guess. 6. What if your site does not get a Knowledge Panel? How do you get one? Illyes: There is no way to do that really. Google does consume Wikidata, so that could get you in. Google also uses the CIA World Factbook. Anything that gets in requires multiple sources of data to support the need for it to be in there. 7. How do I control the picture that shows up for my business in the Knowledge Graph? Illyes: If an incorrect image comes up, report it. Note, though, you need many people to report it for it to get looked at, and they have to come from accounts that have not previously abused the system. (Illyes then mentioned the example of Stone Temple Consulting, which shows an incorrect image of a Chinese temple, and explained that sometimes the problems are hard to fix, but they are working on it.) 8. Can you bring back the link operator? Illyes: No. 9. We heard you say that Baidu uses AMP, but we thought they had their own thing. Moeva: Baidu started with mobile instant pages (MIP), which they still support, but more recently, they have expanded to support AMP pages as well. 10. Do you plan to expand the Google Posts feature? (Note: This is a feature where people can post information directly into the search results, but it’s used in a very limited way today. You can read more about it here). Moeva: This feature was used during the US elections, and we are looking at future potential uses. Of course, for this to work it has to be high-quality info. The target groups are usually not really savvy on the SEO side, so the feature is good for the website-challenged. So we don’t know how we’ll expand it, but we’re trying to see what kinds of groups it makes sense for. 11. In Search Console, when we see links from hacked sites, should we disavow them? Illyes: Do you trust the links? If you don’t, then disavowing them makes sense. Our algorithms do their best to auto-discount these, but these algorithms are written by humans and sometimes subject to error. 12. Should I have my exact keywords in the domain name? Illyes: Exact match domains (EMDs) are not inherently bad, but some people do things with them that makes them bad. If you see someone else that’s ranking and you think it’s because they have an EMD, our advice is to not worry about it and try to figure out the other reasons it ranks. 13. If we have an EMD, but it is really the company name, do we need to worry about EMD algos? Moeva: Unless you have really poor content on 50 EMDs simultaneously, don’t worry about it. Danny Sullivan: If you have an EMD that matches the really good solid content you are already doing, you’re on the right side of history, and you’ll be fine. 14. Is a subdomain or subdirectory better for targeting different countries? Moeva: Our site has a good post on this. It shows a table for when/how to pick which variant. 15. How does Google deal with the new domain names (such as .SHOP). Illyes: These are treated the same as any other TLD. 16. Is it true that Google won’t crawl a URL that has more than two folders? Illyes: No. Moeva: There is a limit to the characters in a URL, though. 17. Does folder depth make a difference ranking wise? Illyes: No. 18. If we launch a subdomain, and it gets penalized, will the domain be impacted? Moeva: It depends on the reason why. If a blog got hacked, then that impacts only the subdomain. Generally, we try to be as surgically granular as possible. 19. Does Google access info from Gmail and other sources to personalize results? Illyes: Yes, if you’re logged in. Sullivan: This happens only within Gmail (I think). 20. Why did you decide to do a video on how to hire an SEO? Moeva: Our target was non-savvy people, to help them understand how to approach it. 21. How many sites do you manually review in a week? Moeva: Every Googler has to do 20 sites before breakfast (joke). Seriously, scale is the main objective. Google is trying to find patterns, more than sites. Ideally, we do this in a way that you find a pattern that scales across many sites. 22. How does it affect our ranking if our responsive mobile site has the same content as the desktop? Illyes: This is the desired behavior, and there is no duplicate content issue since they are on the same URL. Also, there is no such thing as a duplicate content penalty. (Author’s note: If you have duplicate content because you are scraping other people’s sites, this can result in your site being hit by Panda, but that is not what Illyes is addressing in his response.) Having a responsive site will help you, especially in the future. With mobile-first, when it rolls out, responsive sites won’t have to change anything. Other sites may have to do something more to not suffer when that transition happens. 23. What would be harmed by Google being more open and transparent? Sullivan: To be fair, they are very open on many things. Moeva: The issue is that we’re trying to get people to focus on the right things. If we start dissecting (and sharing) what we do every day, this would prevent people from focusing on their sites. You should try to focus on the good stuff. Worrying about what Google change happened, when the next one will be, etc., diverts your focus from where it belongs. Illyes: Both of us teach a class to Nooglers (new Googlers) called the “life of a query.” We know a lot about how it works, and this class is very specific. But, we have to decide if revealing a piece of information will hurt us in the long term. If we share info that causes people to do the wrong things, this can hurt the search results, and we can’t allow that. But we try to be as transparent as possible. 24. Can Google see a bounce on your site, even if not from a search result, and is it a negative result when that happens? Sullivan: In other words, do you use click-through rate (CTR) as ranking factor? Illyes: We only use CTR for QA purposes, not direct ranking purposes. Moeva: We also don’t use things like Chrome to capture data like that. 25. If CTR is not a ranking factor, then why do tests sometimes show that it does influence rankings? Sullivan: What if you believe that Google is lying about this — that you believe they’re using CTR, even though they say they aren’t? What would you do differently with your site? In principle, nothing. You should be trying to optimize to improve CTR and retain users anyway! 26. What about RankBrain and machine learning? What’s up with that? Illyes: Not really anything new happening. The team is focused on some other machine learning ideas, and I can’t say what they are or whether they will be applied to search. But we’re always throwing out ideas on how to better understand pages or queries and working to make search better. Machine learning is just a tool that you can apply to different things. Moeva: A great example is what video to show you next on YouTube; that’s an interesting challenge that is a perfect application for machine learning. We can leverage what people have watched and match them up with choices made by others with similar affinities. Sullivan: Could you have a machine learning search algorithm system now? Illyes: We probably wouldn’t want that, as we still look at search pages manually, and machine learning algorithms are freakishly hard to debug. For example, if we see some problem manually, it would be impossible to figure out why the decision was made. If we replaced the traditional algorithms with machine learning, we would have a really hard time improving results, because we would not able to identify where the failures are or what caused them. Moeva: The algorithms are only as good as the training data that we give them, and that’s a big issue in coming up with good ones. 27. How do you measure voice searches? Can the rest of us get to see that? Moeva: Voice queries are often super long-tail because of their use of natural language, so it’s hard to decide what to show. (Moeva then asked people to provide feedback on what they would do with it.) 28. Is it possible to highlight quick answers in Search Console separately? Illyes: We get this request a lot, and we’ve talked to the highest possible person in the search team to see if they can, but we have not persuaded them yet. We’re still fighting for it, but it’s not a simple problem. Please ping us on Twitter and tell us how you would use that data to help us. 29. How do you get featured snippets? Moeva: Create content that is relevant to the query and structured well. Structure it as an answer to a question. 30. Is WHOIS info used as part of local ranking? Illyes: No idea. 31. Does the percent of 404 pages on your website impact your ranking? Illyes: No. 32. Should we cross-link between product and category pages? Illyes: Does it help users? 33. Does a large e-commerce site have a natural advantage over a small site? Illyes: It doesn’t matter. 34. Will traffic from email and social media help your rankings? Sullivan: In other words, do you use social signals? Illyes: We did it in the past for a specific feature, but then the social media site turned off the feature, and it was a really bad thing, and for this reason we’re not willing to be dependent on social signals. 35. Is content length a ranking factor? Illyes: No. The quality and relevance of the content is the key. 36. Is it bad if we have http and https live on a site at the same time? Illyes: In general, no — but we have seen situations where sites have some differences between the sites, such as they implement hreflang to the http version of the site, but not the https version. That type of thing could be an issue. 37. Do you look primarily at the source code for a page or the document object model (DOM)? Moeva: We look at the DOM. 38. Will we see an AMP e-commerce carousel in the near future? Illyes: We are looking into e-commerce features, and we’re very aware that this functionality is needed. If you want to see what’s planned, check out the AMP roadmap. 39: Is authorship really gone as a ranking factor? Illyes: Yes. Sullivan: Dead, dead, dead, deader than Google+.

The newest addition to the marketing mix’s Ps: Proximity Columnist Brian Smith explains the impact of proximity on local searches and provides advice for how marketers can make it work for them. Brian Smith on March 31, 2017 at 12:09 pm More Any marketer worth their salt, or at least one who has managed to stay awake during Marketing 101, can rattle off a long list of marketing mix “Ps.” You know what I’m talking about: product, price, place, promotion, people, processes and physical evidence. Unfortunately, those old pillars of marketing don’t quite hold up under the weight of today’s digital marketing needs. Our aging mnemonic sorely needs a renovation. It’s time we add proximity into the mix. Digital puts you in the center of the map Long gone are the days of unfolding a paper map to find out where you are and where you want to go. Back then, when you ran off the edge of the map, you either got a new map or assumed that “here be monsters.” You’ll find no edges on today’s digital maps. You are limited only by the power of your zoom and the reach of your click. By default, you are the center of the digital map. The world fills in around you, depending on the whim of your search. Proximity — the distance from the user to any given location — is a heavily weighted ranking factor for all “near me” searches. Only when you specifically move the focal point from yourself to an area without you in it does proximity seem to loosen its grip on rankings. And it makes sense that digital maps should be organized this way. Something closer to you is usually easier to get to than something farther away. For marketers, the further a potential customer is from a store, the less likely it is that the customer will visit the location. Since most people find businesses through local search and digital maps, proximity needs to be a major aspect of every marketing strategy. If you get everything else right but fail to optimize for proximity, you’ll have a hard time leading customers to your brick-and-mortar locations. Local SEO: Tipping the scale of proximity in your favor You can’t control where your customers are when they search, but you can put a finger on the scale of proximity to help you rank above another similarly distanced location in your business category. How? You have two options: You either purchase a higher rank with PPC, or you optimize for organic and hope that the user is searching in an area wide enough that the map needs to filter out locations. Google and the other major search platforms are making it harder to win the organic hustle with each passing year. But there are still things you can do that will help you improve your rankings on the map. First, give yourself a chance to show up in local search results by doing the basics. Make sure that your location information is accurate and properly distributed to all the major location data aggregators. Specifically, your name, address and phone number (NAP) need to be accurate, and your geocoordinates for each location should lead customers to the right place. But the bare minimum doesn’t really cut it anymore. It’s 2017, after all. If you’re relying on the incompetence of your competitors to win at local search, you’re in trouble. So how do you tip the scales in your favor? You increase the weight of your local credibility and authority. Local citations, reviews and Google My Business attributes Proximity’s influence diminishes as the map zooms out. The more area within your field of vision, the more important it is to filter out locations on the map to avoid clutter. If you’re only looking at the area covered by a city block, good luck trying to shake proximity’s influence. However, if you zoom out just a little, other ranking factors increasingly come into play. Recently, Andrew Shotland and Dan Liebson gave a presentation about local search ranking factors at SMX West. Some of the most important factors they uncovered outside of proximity were local citations, reviews and optimizing for Google My Business (GMB). Local citations are important in that they give Google a strong indication that your location is where you say it is and that you have enough clout to attract backlinks. Meanwhile, reviews help establish the local authority of your brand. The more people vouch for your location with positive reviews, the more comfortable Google feels about sending customers your way. Finally, Google My Business is critical for helping your cause in local search. This is especially true for filling out your GMB attributes. We’ve begun to see the proliferation of Google My Business fields for each business type. For example, a restaurant will have the opportunity to fill in fields ranging from payment options, takeout, delivery, patio seating and anything else you’d want to know about a location. You can expect GMB attributes to become a significant ranking signal going forward, thanks to digital assistants and voice search. Why? Because digital assistants and voice search are allowing for much more discerning answers when it comes to helping us find locations. Voice search and digital assistants The way we ask questions is changing. Thanks to digital assistants and voice search, when we talk to Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa or Siri, we give these search engines much more information than we typically do with a typed search. We’re often terse when typing in search queries, mainly because we grew up having to do precise keyword matching if we wanted to see relevant search results. But Google and the other search engines are getting much better at understanding the meaning of words. More importantly, they’re getting better at interpreting user intent. As a result, exact keyword matching is no longer as important — much to the chagrin of advertisers. However, this allows questions and answers to be much more nuanced. The growing intelligence of search engines is fueling the rise of voice search. Instead of typing a simple query on Google like nearby Mexican restaurants, we’re much more likely to get long-winded with voice search and say, “Okay Google, where’s a good nearby Mexican restaurant with patio seating and a short wait?” Thanks to the blossoming artificial intelligence of search engines, these nuanced questions are becoming much easier for digital assistants to answer. But just because Google can understand the intent behind more complex questions, it doesn’t mean that Google has the data to answer them. It’s no mystery why Google is crowdsourcing business attributes through Google Maps by asking users about their recent trips to a location. Google is gathering as much information about a location as possible to have the data to answer more nuanced questions. This presents marketers with an opportunity. If you meet the nuanced criteria of a user’s question by filling out as many applicable attributes as possible in GMB, your location can leapfrog businesses that might be closer but fail to meet the search criteria. After all, there may be only be a handful of restaurants in an area that meet the criteria of my previous voice search question. Proximity is still a factor, of course, but you at least lessen its tyranny and raise your odds of ranking higher organically. Final thought No matter what marketers do, thanks to the way digital maps are organized, it’s hard to escape the influence of proximity on search results. That’s why, even though our list of marketing mix Ps is growing long, it’s time that proximity joins the list.

As the month of March enters its last week, people around the world go on a prank-planning spree to surprise their friends, colleagues and family. Yes, the entire world comes together to pull of hoaxes and tricks in good jest like they do on April Fool’s Day, on April 1 every year. Beyond age and geographical barrier, this is probably as popular as the New Year celebration and if not wittier. But if you think it’s just people who dupe their friends, you are highly mistaken. April Fool’s Day is even a bigger hit in the big corporate world and many companies have teased and tickled emotions of their customers only to later reveal it was nothing but just a prank. So, as we celebrate this day of ‘fooling’ here are 10 best corporate pranks of all-time. T-Mobile’s Binging Headgear Owing to the less time available for watching and re-watching our favourite shows, binging is something we all do now. And it’s not always easy to binge while commuting to work. Taking full advantage of this weakness, T-Mobile made a promise of introducing a superb headgear only later to reveal it was an April Fool’s Day prank. In 2016, the tech brand had apparently designed a hands-free device called “Binge on Up” which would have allowed the users to binge and be productive at the same time. Alas, a hoax! Google’s Cardboard Plastic headset VR glasses are one of the biggest tech gears people around the world are excited about. So, when a company like Google decides to introduce “the world’s first actual reality headset” many missed the pun. The plastic headset designed to work with an ordinary smartphone made VR technology, completely waterproof, and 360-degree audio promised to make real look even more real! Obviously, clear plastic headgear claimed to let you “notice what you do, see, and feel more than before”. Indeed one of best April Fools prank of 2016. H M’s Mark Zuckerberg Clothing Line Also, in 2016, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and clothing brand H M got together to play one of the most bizarre pranks ever, well at least for a day the world thought so. A website with H M’s logo with Zuckerberg’s face decided to troll the world with a unique collection, inspired by Facebook CEO’s dressing choice. Given the fact that he hardly opts for anything other than basic T-shirt and jeans, it was quite surprising. But as the website campaigned, “One less thing to think about in the morning”, it seemed quite Mark-like. The collection included a pair of blue jeans and 7 identical grey T-Shirts! Galaxy BLADE edge: Samsung’s smart knife If there could be smart watches and phones, then why not a smart knife, right? Describing every aspect of this Chef’s Edition special knife the tech giant went overboard. In 2015, through an elaborate blog post, the brand conceptualized the fake product and presented it to the world – it was just commendable. Many also suggested that the knife complimented the ‘edge’ design than the phone itself. However, the Sci-Fi knife that promised to retract the blade before cutting the skin was nothing but a prank. YouTube’s Rickrolling prank YouTube and Google probably have the longest history of quirkiest of pranks. But the video-sharing platform’s first prank in 2008 is probably the most cherished one. The website linked all the featured videos on its homepage to Rick Astley’s classic ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’, a 1987 music video. Yes, no matter where a person logged in to the site the website just played that particular song, a prank commonly known as Rickrolling now. Their other hit pranks include that of 2009 flip-flop prank that turned things upside down on website and text on video prank of 2010. Hotels on Moon and Mars It’s way before NASA decided to launch one-way trip to Mars. Yes, in 2009 Hotels.com and Expedia.com campaigned about hotels on Lunar and Martian soils. Hotel.com released an ad that said rooms starting at about $1,200, excluding travel cost, were available on the Moon. Taking the prank one step further, Expedia advertised hotels on Mars would start at $99! Of course, on April Fool’s Day, Mars was closer than Moon. Virgin Cola’s blue can warning Even before the 21st century, corporate companies played pranks and pulled it off brilliantly. In 1996, Virgin Cola campaigned that to ensure consumer safety their metal cans would turn blue if the drink crossed the expiration date. The brand warned everyone not to buy blue cans. And coincidentally, Pepsi had then unveiled its newly designed bright blue cans. Perfect hoax, and perfect competitive campaign.

The tech giant says the new app is optimized for the iPad and has a couple of features already found in Google Calendar for Android. G Suite allows Android and iOS users alike to “Find a time” to set up meetings much faster. The feature suggest meeting times and available rooms nearby when trying to coordinate with friends or business partners. Google also brings the “Set Goals” functionality to its new iOS app. Google Calendar allows users to set a goal and the calendar schedules a time for you to stick with it. For example, if you wanted to read everyday you could tell Google how often you wanted to read and for how long and when the best time to do your reading is, such as mornings. More updates such as the ‘Today View Widget’ that currently allows iPhone users to view upcoming events from the lock screen, are also part of the revamped iPad app as well.

The process model, i.e. how Firefox is split into various processes and how these processes interact between each other is common to all platforms. For more information see the Electrolysis wiki page. The security aspects of a sandboxed child process are implemented on a per-platform basis. See the Platform Specifics section below for more information.

File System Restrictions Sandboxing enforces file system write and read restrictions for XUL based add-on content (frame and process) scripts. To avoid issues as sandboxing features roll out add-on authors should update their legacy add-on code today such that content scripts no longer attempt to read or write from restricted locations. Note these restrictions do not affect WebExtension content script or XUL add-on script running in the browser process. File system access rules for content processes, reverse precedence: Location Access Type Restriction file system read/write deny by default install location write deny install location read allow system library locations write deny system library locations read allow profile/* read/write deny by default profile/extensions write deny profile/extensions read allow Debugging Features Activity Logging The following prefs control sandbox logging. Output is sent to the Browser Console when available, and to a developer console attached to the running browser process. security.sandbox.logging.enabled (boolean) 
security.sandbox.windows.log.stackTraceDepth (integer, Windows specific) 
 The following environment variables also triggers sandbox logging output: MOZ_SANDBOX_LOGGING=1
 OSX Specific Sandbox violation logging is on by default when the sandbox is enabled. Use the Console.app application to view the logs. Local Build Options To disable building the sandbox completely build with this in your mozconfig: ac_add_options --disable-sandbox To disable just the content sandbox parts: ac_add_options --disable-content-sandbox Misc. Environment variables ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE DESCRIPTION PLATFORM MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX Disables content process sandboxing for debugging purposes. All MOZ_DISABLE_GMP_SANDBOX Disable media plugin sandbox for debugging purposes, all platforms. All MOZ_DISABLE_NPAPI_SANDBOX Disable 64-bit NPAPI process sandbox, Windows specific. Windows MOZ_ALLOW_WEAKER_SANDBOX Specific to 64-bit Plugin sandbox, allows 64-bit NPAPI sandbox level to drop below 2. Windows Platform Specifics Windows Source Code Overview The core of the Windows sandbox is Google's chromium sandbox. Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library (bug 925471): For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Bug Lists Windows Content Process sbwc1 low integrity sandbox support Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release.

But privilege escalation via kernel vulnerabilities is relatively common, so we also use the seccomp-bpf system call filter to reduce the attack surface that a compromised content process can directly access.

Now, they can do the same thing on their modern smartphones thanks to an ingenious easter egg from Google . The search company has added Ms. Pac-Man to the Maps app as a limited-time treat to celebrate April Fool's Day. You can play it either on a phone or a desktop just by clicking/tapping on the Ms. Pac-Man button in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. You'll be transported to a random location where the map itself becomes the game's level. Read More How to get SECRET retro games in Google Chrome - play Pac-Man and Breakout at the office Pac Man on your mobile - a great way to spend a few hours Swiping the screen (or using the keyboard) guides Ms. Pac-Man around and the aim, as ever, is to munch all the dots whilst avoiding the ghosts. As with the original, you can pick up fruit for a bonus score. Google has set up a leaderboard so that players can measure how well they do against their friends. As much as we'd love for this to become a permanent fixture of the app, Google has said it will only be available until April 4. The search giant previously deployed a fully functional version of the original Pac-Man as a Google doodle in 2010. That game is still available in the online archives - type Pac-Man Google doodle into the search engine and you can play it right now.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us New tools for developing games for Actions on Google By John Hoff - March 31, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you remember, Actions on Google was launched December last year as the developer platform for the new Google Assistant digital voice assistant. Since that time, there have been quite a number of third party companies utilizing the API to create actions specific to their products or service on Google Assistant. But quite creatively, there also have been people who created games for Google Assistant – and the mothership is giving them more tools to create better games for this specific platform. Games like Akinator and SongPop have been ported to Google Assistant via the Actions on Google platform, using the associated Actions SDK and API. The good news is, Google is updating the toolset so better games can be made for Google Assistant. First up, Google is releasing a new sound effect library to make games more engaging. These sounds range from airplanes, whistles, bowling pins, and a whole lot more. Secondly, Google has just published a guide to port those “Interactive Fiction” text-based games into Google Assistant. We’re pretty sure some of you spent hours upon hours of solving these mysteries that were usually just plain text and accepted simple commands. Now imagine if you can have those games on Google Assistant. Lastly, if you are looking to create new types of games for Google Assistant, you can look at the updated list of companies that have integrated their solutions for Google Assistant. Your journey to creating a new game may start by talking to the right people. Check out the source link below for additional information.

It can give you a simpler email workflow. Find out if Inbox by Gmail can be the better choice for you. Read More , there are still many who use good old Gmail. And developers make more extensions for them. If you use the mighty combination of Google Chrome and Gmail, there are some new add-ons you need to check out. All the extensions are about being more productive in your inbox. Whether it’s speeding up attachments or writing notes and reminders, these tools help get things done. And remember, you can install Chrome extensions on Opera How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser Opera is making a case for you to switch to it.

Handle: Combine Emails With To-Do Lists and Calendars A productivity motto is to not let your inbox turn into a to-do list. While it is logical, it ignores the fact that your email is where you find out your tasks 9 Instant Ways to Turn Your Emails into Tasks 9 Instant Ways to Turn Your Emails into Tasks You can't stop to-do-type emails from ending up in your inbox, but you can turn them into tasks to manage them better. Here are some tips to turn emails into tasks. Read More . Gmail users can enable Tasks in the side pane, but Handle is a far better to-do list made for the inbox. You can convert any email into a task by typing “T” or with mouse actions, and all the content transfers to the task notes. Handle also works with your Google Calendar to set deadlines, plan your projects, or add reminders. By default, Handle shows up next to your Gmail inbox, in the right-side pane. That’s just the to-do list though. The full Handle app shows this list next to the calendar, where you can plan your schedule. Handle also has an accompanying app for iPhones where you can check the to-do list, and share emails from Gmail to the app. An Android version is coming soon. Download — Handle for Chrome (Free) 2. Rename Email: Rename the Subject Line Ideally, an email’s subject line should tell you How To Make Your Email Message Stand Out In A Cluttered Inbox How To Make Your Email Message Stand Out In A Cluttered Inbox Have you ever sent an email you felt was important only to be answered many days later, or worse forgotten about? Granted, sometimes it’s out of your control, but there are things you can do... Read More exactly what it is about. But we all know that this doesn’t happen often. People use generic subjects like “Important” or “Read this”, which doesn’t help anyone. Rename Email lets you correct this so you can identify messages easily in the future. Open any message you have received and you’ll see a Rename Email button in the toolbar above. Click it to change the subject to something meaningful for you. For example, turning that random “Important” subject line to “Notes for Meeting on Monday at 9”. Rename Email also works with threaded conversations in Gmail. You can rename the subject line for all messages in a thread, or for select messages. This way, you can leave a long thread as is, but mark the one important mail in it. The renamed subjects won’t show up in your smartphone Gmail app, and only work on browsers with Rename Email. Download — Rename Email for Chrome (Free) 3. Simple Gmail Notes: Add Personal Notes to Any Email When you receive a paper memo or project around the office, you’ll stick a Post-It on the folder with your notes. Can’t do that with digital memos or projects, can you? Well, you can if you install Simple Gmail Notes. This extension opens a Notes pane atop every email. Write what you want in that so it serves as a personal notepad for you. Simple Gmail Notes saves this on your Google Drive, so the information isn’t going to some undisclosed server. You can also instantly add an email as a Google Calendar entry. The notes show up in the inbox view as well, looking like green labels. Of course, it’s not a label, you can see your entire note. The notes won’t show up in your smartphone Gmail app, and only work on browsers with Simple Gmail Notes. But overall, it’s a much better solution than other ways to add notes to Gmail threads Please Note This Email! Some Super-Useful Tools To Help You Add Notes & Annotate Your Gmail Threads Please Note This Email! Some Super-Useful Tools To Help You Add Notes & Annotate Your Gmail Threads Threaded conversations and smart labels were a start.

Choose the source, which currently supports YouTube, Amazon, Twitter, Giphy, and a few others. Search within that source to find what you’re looking for. Everything happens within your Compose window. Essentially, SnipHero is like a widget. The extension will insert the chosen media into the message’s body, and you’re ready to send it. Download — SnipHero for Chrome (Free) 5.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Security Google Resolves Five Dangerous Vulnerabilities in Chrome 57 Stable Channel Update for Desktop By Zara Ali Mar 30, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Google released an update for its Chrome web browser aimed at tackling vulnerabilities. The update fixes a total of five severe vulnerabilities; wherein one is marked as ‘critical’ and the other four as ‘high risk.’ The update version is Chrome 57.0.2987.133. The stable Chrome 57.0.2987.133 update is released for Windows, Mac, and Linux users, it arrives just a few weeks after the version 57 browser found its stability. The update brings a handful of enhancements to the overall functionality of the browser. The last update brought features like CSS Grid Layout and also patched 36 vulnerabilities. The latest Chrome 57.0.2987.133 update addresses five lethal vulnerabilities. Related Chrome 57 Gets Stable Release For Chromebooks Bringing Action For Power Button On Convertibles It resolves the most severe ‘Critical Use’ bug that was causing issues in printing. The bug was identified by the bug bounty hunter Wadih Matar, who is awarded a $9,337 bounty finding it out. The other four ‘high risk’ bugs include Heap buffer overflow in V8 (CVE-2017-5054), which was found another bug hunter Nicolas Trippar of Zimperium zLabs, he also received $3000 as the bounty prize. Another such bug was Bad cast in Blink (CVE-2017-5052), which was identified by JeongHoon Shin, who got a bounty prize of $1000. Advertisement The other ‘high risk’ bug was Blink (CVE-2017-5056), which was found by an anonymous researcher. And the last one was Out of bounds memory access in V8 (CVE-2017-5053), which was discovered by Team Sniper (Keen Lab and PC Mgr) and tipped by ZDI (ZDI-CAN-4587). For these two bugs, Google’s advisory did not reveal the bounty prize. To recall, Chrome for Android (57.0.2987.132) also debuted this week and it also tackled a vulnerability in Blink (CVE-2017-5056). Admittedly, in January Google rolled out Chrome 56 stable update that resolved 51 vulnerabilities. After releasing the January update, Google announced that Gmail will no longer support Chrome version 53 and below, which was a major setback for Windows XP and Vista users. For these users, the last Chrome update was Chrome 49. The Chrome 59 update that was released recently brought new functionalities such as more controls for Custom Tabs. It also included support for web apps access to Android app’s drawer along with system features and notifications panel. Related Chrome 57 for Android Gets Custom Tabs Options And Progressive Web Apps Chrome is becoming better with each update, it remains to be seen how Google plans on combating the security issues that pop up every now and then.

News Google Maps Turns into Ms. Pac-Man for April Fools’ Day Share Tweet by Kyle Hanson on March 31, 2017 The internet is an odd place on April 1st, and it seems that that has extended to March 31st this year with many companies and websites revealing their April Fools’ Day jokes and games. Google always does something big and crazy, and this year is no different with Google Maps turning into a giant Ms. Pac-Man game either on your PC or mobile. All you need to do to play is head to Google Maps or open the Google Maps app on your smartphone. You’ll see a button on there that either looks like Ms. Pac-Man or says “Insert Coin”. Click/tap that and the game will begin, zooming in on your current location or jumping to a random one, and then transforming the roads into a Pac-Man map. You can then use the arrow buttons on PC or swipe on the screen on your smartphone in order to control Ms. Pac-Man. This isn’t Google’s first Pac-Man game, with a previous “doodle” allowing visitors to play the game inside of the Google logo. The last one wasn’t for April Fools’ Day, instead it was to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the iconic series. This became hugely popular and was later put back online just so people could keep playing it. Ms. Pac-Man is a true arcade classic, taking the original hit and making it somewhat more complex and engaging for players. It was a huge hit for Midway and Namco when it was released in 1991. The franchise has had some down years as of late, but releases like Pac-Man Championship Edition have definitely helped bring it back to the front of many gamers’ minds. What other April Fools’ Day pranks have you seen online? Do you enjoy the jokes that invade the internet? Let us know what you think in the comments.

This week, the Google SERP has got a bit more interactive with the addition of rich results for podcasts, and a new study has found that marketers are still failing to use advanced search tactics in their campaigns. Plus, Google has launched a new website to bring all of its open-source projects under one umbrella, and an unlikely partnership has arisen between Google and Chinese search giant Baidu to bring faster mobile web pages to a wider user base. Google adds rich results for podcasts to the SERP Google has stealthily launched some new guidelines for structured data on its Developers blog, to bring rich results for podcasts to the SERP. At the moment the new feature is only available via Google Home (where you can use voice activation to start up a podcast) or in the Google Search app v6.5 or higher on Android, but Google hopes to soon add support for Chrome on Android. Google’s blog provided a sample image for how this will look in practice: In his article for Search Engine Watch this week, Clark Boyd explains how you can get your podcast indexed on the SERP, and how to add the right structured data to your podcasts. Study: Marketers still aren’t using advanced search tactics Those of us who keep close tabs on search innovation and strategy – or comment on it – are probably familiar with search tactics like retargeting lists for search ads (RLSA), voice search optimization, ad extensions in paid search listings, and schema markup. We know how to use them, and the benefits that they bring to ROI and visibility. But a study by Bing and search agency Catalyst has revealed that among marketers as a whole, very few still are making use of advanced search tactics like these in their campaigns. When asked which of a range of tactics their company used or was planning to use in 2016, only 34% of marketers reported using ad extensions; 30% said they used Product Listing Ads (PLAs); and 28% used retargeting lists for search ads (RLSA). Just 28% of respondents reported using voice search optimization, 27% said they used sitelinks, and a dismal 17% reported using schema markup. So why are many marketers still failing to tap into the full potential of search? Search Engine Watch spoke to Microsoft’s Rob Wilk and Catalyst’s Kerry Curran to find out what search marketers can do to improve their campaigns. Twitter introduces pre-roll ads for Periscope Pre-roll ads might just be everyone’s least favorite ad format – so much so that YouTube did away with 30-second unskippable pre-roll ads earlier this year. But Twitter-owned livestreaming platform Periscope announced this week that it will be adding pre-roll ads to live and replay Periscope streams. The new ad product is named, unsurprisingly, Ads on Periscope, and is an expansion of Twitter’s existing Amplify ad product. The Periscope ads are expected to share revenue with content creators in the same 70/30 split as Amplify ads. Amidst Twitter’s struggle to drive revenue on its social platform, monetizing Periscope could be one way to bolster its flagging fortunes. But the autoplay ads may prove to be unpopular with users, especially with the news that they will run over streaming content – meaning that viewers will miss several seconds while the ad finishes.

Google adds rich results for podcasts to SERPs A visual history of Google SERPs: 1996 to 2017 Google’s new site brings all of its open-source projects under one umbrella Google has launched a new website this week which is designed to act as a central directory for all of its open-source projects, bringing them together under one umbrella. In its blog post announcing the launch, ‘A New Home for Google Open Source‘, Google wrote that the new site: showcases the breadth and depth of our love for open source. It will contain the expected things: our programs, organizations we support, and a comprehensive list of open source projects we’ve released. But it also contains something unexpected: a look under the hood at how we “do” open source. The site contains the source code for Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages Project official website, as well as the source code for its Android mobile OS, the Chromium web browser, its Tesseract Optical Character Recognition engine, and hundreds of other Google projects, both well-known and obscure. While Google has always made the code for these projects available on GitHub and its self-hosted git service (this being the nature of open source), this is the first time users have been able to browse them from a central location, and is sure to provide Google enthusiasts with plenty of cool material to scour. Baidu is working hand-in-hand with Google to accelerate the mobile web And speaking of Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), an unlikely partnership has arisen in the world of search, as Baidu and Google confirmed that they are teaming up to bring a faster mobile web to a wider user base. Google has a rocky history with China. It has had a presence in the country since 2005, but in 2010 decided to stop censoring its searches in accordance with Chinese law in response to a Chinese-originated hacking attack on itself and a number of other US tech companies, redirecting the searches instead to its Hong Kong search engine. Access to Google’s search engine and services has been blocked by the Chinese government on a number of occasions. In the wake of this, native Chinese search engine Baidu overtook Google as the main search provider in China, and now enjoys around 80% of the Chinese search market, while Google China only has about 10%. But the two have evidently agreed to set aside their rivalry in order to pursue a higher goal: accelerating the mobile web. At Google’s first AMP conference in New York, Baidu’s Gao Lei announced Mobile Instant Pages (Chinese-language link), or MIP, Baidu’s answer to Accelerated Mobile Pages. Hermas Ma reported on Search Engine Land that MIP has very similar technology to AMP, the main difference being that MIP are optimized for the Chinese internet. Mobile Instant Pages can reportedly reduce the rendering of above-the-fold content by 30 to 80 percent, and Baidu has been considering giving MIP a ranking advantage in search results (something which AMP doesn’t yet have). Ma also notes that the AMP Project website now loads in mainland China where it didn’t before, further pointing to a burying of the hatchet between Google and its Chinese counterpart.

But now, potentially millions of websites that use SSL certificates issued by Symantec and affiliated resellers could find that their certificates are effectively worthless as far as Chrome is concerned, after a member of the Chrome team published a proposal that would make them untrusted over the next 12 months. The reason? According to the Google Chrome team, Symantec has not properly validated thousands of certificates. In fact, the Chrome team claims that “an initial set of reportedly 127 [misissued] certificates has expanded to include at least 30,000 [misissued] certificates, issued over a period spanning several years.” Ryan Sleevi, the Chrome team member who wrote the announcement, elaborated, “This is also coupled with a series of failures following the previous set of misissued certificates from Symantec, causing us to no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years.” Under the proposal he put forth, the accepted validity period of newly-issued Symantec to nine months or less, and an “incremental distrust” of currently-trusted certificates and removal of recognition of Extended Validation status of Symantec-issued certificates. A nightmare scenario? Symantec is the currently the largest Certificate Authority (CA) and by some estimates, has issued a third of the SSL certificates in use on the web. So if the Google Chrome team moves forward with its proposal, it will have a huge impact on Symantec and its customers. Symantec would have to reissue potentially millions of certificates, creating a huge headache for customers, who would have to go through the validation process and install replacement certificates. What’s more, under the Chrome team’s proposal, Chrome would immediately remove the status indicators for Extended Validation certificates issued by Symantec. These certificates, which require companies to provide greater verification that they are who they say they are, are often used by companies running websites that absolutely need to use HTTPS, such as those that handle payments and financial transactions. Extended Validation certificates are more costly, and one of the justifications for the greater cost is the fact that most browsers display indicators for websites that use them. If those indicators go away, it could theoretically harm companies that have relied on these indicators to signal trust to their users. Not surprisingly, given the gravity of the situation, Symantec is disputing the Chrome team’s claims about certificate misissuances. In a response, it called the Chrome team’s proposal “irresponsible” and said the allegations leveled at it are “exaggerated and misleading.” Symantec is open to working with the Google Chrome team and while it’s reasonable to hope that both parties will identify a satisfactory resolution that averts disruption, companies with certificates issued by Symantec will want to monitor the situation as it develops.

In an interview with CNBC, both Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet and Jonathan Rosenberg, adviser to CEO Larry Page, say that data analytics will become increasingly important in workplaces. "I think a basic understanding of data analytics is incredibly important for this next generation of young people," Schmidt tells CNBC. "That's the world you're going into." "By data analytics," the executive chairman says, "I mean a basic knowledge of how statistics works, a basic knowledge of how people make conclusions over big data." Focusing more on data analytics will help businesses too, the executives say. Hiring professionals with the right skills and a penchant for bold, creative thinking was a strategy that drove Google's innovation, Schmidt and Rosenberg write in a recently updated version of their book, "How Google Works." Rob Kim/Getty Images Google executive Jonathan Rosenberg and executive Chairman EricSchmidt, co-authors of "How Google Works." According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of roles for individuals with this skills set is expected to grow by 30 percent over the next seven years, well above average. Data analysts make sense of large amounts of information using statistical tools and techniques. They're able to pinpoint trends and correlations using programs such as Excel, SAS and SQL and Tableau. They typically study statistics, data science or math. Schmidt says that being able to use calculus would be a great asset to an employee, but an understanding of how to approach big data would still be very helpful in finding a job. "Data is the sword of the 21st century, those who wield it well, the samurai." -Jonathan Rosenberg, adviser to Larry Page and former SVP of products at Google Rosenberg agrees. "My favorite statement that echoes Eric's," he says," is 'Data is the sword of the 21st century, those who wield it well, the samurai.'" The quote comes from an internal memo Rosenberg sent to employees in 2009, following the inauguration of President Barack Obama. "Everyone should be able to defend arguments with data," he writes in the memo. "Information transparency helps people [...] determine who is telling the truth."

Most check out well before what is considered the maximum age of 115, and some of them could afford to keep going far longer, if only science would allow it. The urge to combat aging, especially among the affluent, is an old one, but new technological breakthroughs can make the prospect seem tantalizingly close. Friend joins Nobel Prize-winning scientists, icons of the entertainment industry such as Goldie Hawn and Moby, and tech billionaires like Google co-founder Sergey Brin, for the launch of the National Academy of Medicine's Grand Challenge in Health Longevity, which will distribute $25 million as part of its endeavors to, as one doctor puts it, "end aging forever." Alex Wong | Getty Images Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, at the Republican National Convention on July 21, 2016 at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. For the super rich in the "life-extension community," it's a small world. Brin, whose company has invested over $1 billion in a "longevity lab" called Calico (short for the California Life Company), is dating Nicole Shanahan, the founder of a patent-management business that will work with some of the National Academy's biotech patents. According to Friend, Shanahan attended the launch with Brin: "I'm here with my darling, Sergey," she said, referring to her boyfriend, Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google. "And he called me yesterday and said, 'I'm reading this book, "Homo Deus," and it says on page twenty-eight that I'm going to die.' I said, 'It says you, personally?' He said, 'Yes!' " (In the book, the author, Yuval Noah Harari, discusses Google's anti-aging research, and writes that the company "probably won't solve death in time to make Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin immortal.") Brin, sitting a few feet away, gave the crowd a briskly ambiguous nod: Yes, I was singled out for death; no, I'm not actually planning to die. If all goes well, Brin won't age, either, or not past a certain point. Slowing or stopping that process is the current focus of biochemist Ned David, co-founder of Unity Biotechnology, who is 49 but, according to Friend, looks 30. The scientist's youthfulness is part of his appeal, writes Friend. Last fall, Unity raised a hundred and sixteen million dollars from such investors as Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel, billionaires eager to stretch our lives, or at least their own, to a span that Thiel has pinpointed as "forever." In a field rife with charlatans, Ned David's Dorian Gray affect has factored into his fund-raising. "One class of investor, like Fidelity, finds my youthful appearance alarming," he said. "Another class — the Silicon Valley type, a Peter Thiel — finds anyone who looks over 40 alarming." Investing in bio-tech breakthroughs is one way the super rich are trying to stay young and healthy indefinitely. Others in the community are settling for cryogenic freezing, in the hopes that they can be thawed once regenerative science has sufficiently advanced. Qin Chen | CNBC Alcor CEO Max More poses in front of the dewars that house his 147 cryopreserved patients. CNBC reported in 2016 that "thousands of people around the world have put their trust, lives and fortunes into the promise of cryonics." At that point, at Alcor's center in Scottsdale, Ariz., nearly 150 individuals had elected to preserve either their heads ($80,000) or their entire bodies ($200,000) in liquid nitrogen. Some wealthy individuals are covering their bases: Thiel has invested in both Unity and Alcor. If there is a way to "solve death," as Friend puts it, whether through cryonics or gene therapies, a kind of vampirism in which Silicon Valley billionaires "end up being sustained by young blood" or more wholesome methods such as good nutrition and medicine, some combination of the above or perhaps an actual sorcerer's stone, the next generation of well-funded alchemists is determined to find it. As a 30-year-old start-up founder confidently tells Friend, "The proposition that we can live forever is obvious. It doesn't violate the laws of physics, so we will achieve it." show chapters This woman is freezing her brain so she can see the future    Tuesday, 26 Apr 2016 | 7:00 AM ET | 05:14 Ester BloomSenior Editor, CNBC Make It Primetime Shows Watch full episodes | TV schedule To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email You’re probably well aware that companies are spying on you — and by “spying,” I mean collecting personal data to better understand your behaviors and habits. A serious breach of privacy, some say. But most people are only concerned about three particular companies.

No, you can’t forget Amazon, the largest internet-based company on the planet. Did you think Amazon was too noble to breach your privacy? You’d be surprised. Here’s what the company knows about you and where that knowledge comes from. What Does Amazon Know About You? The screenshot above shows my Amazon homepage. I’m sharing it so that you can see what Amazon’s recommendation engine thinks I like. All of these recommendations and advertisements are based on my personal history with Amazon, which actually starts way back in 2010. So Where Does Amazon Gather All of Its Information From? User profile — This one’s a no-brainer, but any details you fill out in your account profile will be stored and kept by Amazon. Yes, this includes personal information (e.g. your shipping addresses) and payment methods (e.g. your credit card numbers). Browsing — As you browse the site and shop for goods, Amazon records all kinds of details: your IP address, your browser, operating system, timezone, which pages you visit, length of time on each page, which buttons you click or don’t click, etc. Search queries — When you search for items, Amazon keeps track of what you searched, when you searched it, and which products you ended up viewing based on those searches. Wish lists — As you create and add items to Wish Lists, Amazon keeps track of that to refine your interest profile and learn what kinds of items you’re currently interested in. This is also true for item registries, such as the recently added Amazon Baby Registry feature How to Create an Amazon Baby Registry That Everyone Loves How to Create an Amazon Baby Registry That Everyone Loves As your baby is about to arrive, your friends and family will ask what they should buy for new one. The Baby Registry from Amazon is the perfect place for a Baby Needs This list. Read More . Order history — This one’s a big one: Amazon tracks each and every item you ever purchased. In fact, if you revisit any item you’ve purchased in the past, Amazon will tell you when you bought it. This information is used to further refine your interest profile. Reviews and ratings — Any time you rate and review an item, Amazon uses that to refine your interest profile. It makes sense, right? Whether you love or hate an item, Amazon can use that to better understand what kind of shopper you are. Contests and surveys — If you ever participate in an Amazon contest, questionnaire, or survey, your responses will be stored and associated with you as a shopper. Mobile app — If you use any mobile apps developed by Amazon or its subsidiaries, be aware that those apps will track and transmit location data back to Amazon whenever possible. Streaming services — One of the big benefits of Amazon Prime is that you get access to high-quality TV shows and movies with Prime Video 10+ TV Shows That Make Amazon Prime Worth the Money 10+ TV Shows That Make Amazon Prime Worth the Money Netflix is undoubtedly the king of the movie and TV show streaming services.

It certainly deserves much more credit than it's currently getting. Read on to find out why. Read More . And yes, Amazon tracks your viewing habits to better understand your tastes as a consumer. What About Amazon’s Gadgets? In December 2016, investigators of an Arkansas murder found an Amazon Echo at the scene of the crime and requested that Amazon hand over the audio data in case it could shed light on what exactly happened leading up to the incident. Amazon refused. Either way, this raises some important concerns. The Amazon Echo is a voice-activated device that responds to verbal commands. In order to respond to verbal cues, it needs to be “always listening.” There’s no way around this. But how much of what it hears is recorded? According to Amazon, the Echo only has 60 seconds of recorded audio at any given time. Once the wake word is detected, the recorded audio and the following verbal command are uploaded to Amazon’s cloud. The recorded audio’s purpose is to help improve the Echo’s performance. Note that Alexa — the voice-activated assistant that powers the Echo — is also present in the Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV Stick. So it would be disingenuous to say that Amazon is literally spying on you through the use of always-listening devices. As with all the tracking done for Amazon shoppers, the intention behind these recordings is to improve the service and products so that Amazon can better serve you. That being said, Amazon is collecting a ton of data on you as far as which devices you’re using, where you use them, how you use them, and what kinds of issues you run into while using them. Keep this in mind when using, say, an Amazon Kindle. How to Minimize Amazon’s Data Collection First things first: Amazon does allow you to tweak your privacy settings and restrict how much personal data to collect, but doing so may prevent you from using some of Amazon’s services (because these services depend on said data to work properly). For example, the 1-Click Purchase feature relies on stored shipping addresses and payment methods. If you erase those details from your profile, there’s no way to 1-Click anything. How to Delete Stored Shipping Addresses Go to Manage Address Book settings. Click Delete to delete a stored shipping address. When asked to confirm, click Yes. Repeat for all stored shipping addresses. How to Delete Stored Payment Methods Go to Manage Payment Options settings. Click Delete to delete a stored payment method. When asked to confirm, click Yes. Repeat for all stored payment methods. How to Disable Product Browsing History Go to the Your Browsing History page. Click Manage History on the right side. Next, Remove all items to wipe your history. Then, Turn Browsing History on/off to disable this feature. Alternatively, you can remove individual items from your history by clicking Remove under each. How to Delete Wish Lists Go to Manage Your Lists settings. Click List Settings at the top right. Mark all checkboxes under the Delete column. Click Submit. Alternatively, you can go through each wish list and delete individual items to revoke specific insights that Amazon might have about you. For true privacy, however, consider wiping all lists entirely. How to Delete Your Amazon Item Reviews Go to the Reviews Written by You page. Click Delete review under the review rating. Repeat for all reviews you want to delete. How to Disable Amazon’s Targeted Advertising Go to Amazon Advertising Preferences. Select Do Not Personalize Ads from Amazon for this Internet Browser. Click Submit. Repeat for all browsers you use to shop on Amazon. How to Disable Amazon’s Location Tracking Disable Location Services on Android Navigate to the device settings. Under the Personal category, tap on Location. Toggle On to Off to disable location services. Starting with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, you can disable location permissions on an app-to-app basis. Navigate to the settings page for apps configuration, go to the location section, and toggle the apps that you don’t want knowing your location. Disable Location Services on iOS Navigate to the device settings. Tap on Privacy. Tap on Location Services. Toggle On to Off for individual apps. How to Delete Amazon Echo Recordings Go to Manage Your Content and Devices settings. Click Your Devices at the top. Select your Amazon Echo. Click Manage voice recordings. Read the disclaimer and click Delete to wipe them all. Alternatively, you can go to the Alexa app on your mobile device, navigate to the History settings, and delete individual recordings instead of wiping them all at once. It’s impossible to be completely private when on the internet, especially if you want to use a site that’s as data-driven as Amazon. However, with these settings tweaked, you will minimize your risk of exposure in case something ever happens, such as hackers infiltrating and stealing data 6 Warning Signs Of Digital Identity Theft You Shouldn't Ignore 6 Warning Signs Of Digital Identity Theft You Shouldn't Ignore Identity theft isn't too rare of an occurrence these days, yet we often fall into the trap of thinking that it'll always happen to "someone else".

The fact that people generate data that is left is the public domain is ,in the final analysis, the fault of the person who generated it. Data one made public or placed in the public cannot be claimed as private - despite the state's recent attempt to do so.

Here's how to protect yourself. Earlier this week, the Republican-led Congress voted to repeal FCC rules that blocked ISPs from selling your data to third parties without permission. The vote largely fell along party lines, and President Trump is expected to sign the joint resolution, S.J. Res 34. The new rules will allow ISPs (your Comcasts, Charters, and AT&Ts) to "harvest" their customers' online data and sell it to third-party marketers. Monetized online behavior isn't new, of course. If you were to Google "cold remedies," for example, you shouldn't be surprised to later encounter web ads for decongestants and tissues. What magical marketing fairies enabled this seamless synergy, you ask? Big Data! Just about all your online data is automatically scraped, organized, and sold to advertisers so they can micro-tailor their sales pitches. This very profitable business model is how Google and Facebook have amassed astounding fortunes despite the fact that they give their products away for free. Your data isn't necessarily used maliciously (as long as you don't consider capitalism to be inherently malicious), but it's unsettling to know your private data is just out there and up for sale in some virtual marketplace. And now your ISP can get in the Big Data game as well. New FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the move reverses "privacy regulations designed to benefit one group of favored companies over another group of disfavored companies." The subtext of the chairman's comment being that he believes the previous administration crafted rules to support Democratic-friendly Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google, while blocking out less-favored corporations like home cable/internet providers (blech). However, that comparison doesn't exactly pan out. While it is true that companies like Google and Facebook make money off your behavior, you are not forced to use those services. If you suddenly decided to stop using Facebook, you might miss out on cute pet pics and political rants from your friends and family, but you could still live a thoroughly modern existence. You could even choose to avoid the Google-o-sphere entirely by using Bing or DuckDuckGo for your web searches, Dropbox instead of Google Drive, or iOS instead of the Google-maintained Android. You don't have this choice when it comes to your ISP—your home's gateway to the entirety of the internet. While there are alternatives to Google and Facebook, most Americans have limited home ISP alternatives. Some areas have only one provider. So this bill gives a green light to unescapable corporate data mining. You and your data are captives—unless you take proactive action to protect it. "ISPs are in a position to see a lot of what you do online. They kind of have to be, since they have to carry all of your traffic," explains Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) senior staff technologist Jeremy Gillula. "Unfortunately, this means that preventing ISP tracking online is a lot harder than preventing other third-party tracking—you can't just install [EFF-made privacy-minded browser add on] Privacy Badger or browse in incognito or private mode." VPN to the Rescue? One of the best ways to secure your data is to use a virtual private network (VPN), which provides greater control of how you're identified online. Simply put, a VPN creates a virtual encrypted "tunnel" between you and a remote server operated by a VPN service. All external internet traffic is routed through this tunnel, so your ISP can't see your data. If the site you're heading to uses HTTPS, your data stays encrypted, too. Best of all, your computer appears to have the IP address of the VPN server, masking your identity. Even before Congress tackled this issue, VPNs were handy tools to protect yourself from criminals tapping into public Wi-Fi networks, or from firewalls segregating users based on geographic location (so, you could, say, watch a movie that was only licensed for streaming in another country; sorry, Netflix is now cracking down on this process). We should note that there are multiple ways your behavior can be tracked online—even with a VPN, things like cookies allow web services (Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.) to track your internetting even after you've left their sites (here's a handy guide to pruning cookies on your browser.) Some users might find that using a VPN slightly slows down their connection speeds, but if you have a fast connection and a good device, you probably won't notice a difference. We test a lot of VPN services in our labs and rounded up some of the best ones. The top VPN services will have numerous servers to help keep traffic flowing freely, as well as the ability to choose a geographically close VPN server, which will help to further cut down on latency. While there are some high-quality free VPNs out there (see our list of top free VPNs), some may choose a subscription pay VPN service more for versatility and speed. If speed is a top priority, we rounded up the Fastest VPNs from our testing labs. For mobile users, we also have a guide to the Best VPNs for Android. If you're on iOS, NordVPN is our current Editors' Choice for iPhones. Related The Best Encryption Software of 2017 The Best Encryption Software of 2017 Of course, computers and phones aren't the only thing connected to the internet these days. There's a whole array of smart home products that probably connect to your router (and therefore to your ISP). Shielding browsing behavior may be enough security for most users—if providers really want to know what you're doing with your smart bulbs and smart BBQ grills, then so be it. However, we are increasingly using voice-UI assistants (Alexa, Google Home) to handle more complex and personal tasks. These devices can know a lot about you and your family. If you want to hook these services up to VPNs, then you may need to implement a router-based solution. Many VPN services offer that, but they may require purchasing additional hardware. For example, NordVPN offers a number of VPN routers through its site, which the company says will mask all your connected devices. We're entering a new paradigm people.

One of the many ways online scammers attempt to steal accounts to gain access to personal data is by tricking users into logging in via fake web pages that look real. So when a legitimate service decides to change their sign-in page design, it's important users know it's a legitimate change. Google is set to do exactly that. The sign-in pages for its web services such as Gmail or the G Suite are being redesigned in the coming weeks to "have a cleaner, simpler look." The change is being implemented to make the sign-in process considerably faster, but at the same time ensuring the look remains the same regardless of whether you're on a PC, tablet, or smartphone. Here's the new look sign-in page courtesy of VentureBeat: Related Gmail Now Lets You Preview Video Attachments Gmail Now Lets You Preview Video Attachments The information entered to sign in will not be changing. An email address and password coupled with any two-factor authentication system you have enabled will remain in place. This is simply a visual design change. The old look sign-in page will only load if you are using an old version of a browser or JavaScript is disabled. Both are unlikely to happen, especially if you are using Google's own auto-updating Chrome browser. JavaScript is enabled by default in all the major browsers, and very few people turn it off as an increasing amount of content on the web relies on it to function. As to when the new sign-in pages will appear, that's unclear. "In the next few weeks" suggests a slow roll out by Google across different territories.

This afternoon, Harrison’s “A Peaceful Future” is being named as the winning art in the national Doodle 4 Google student contest — and appears on the Google home page. Harrison rendered eight young people as symbols of diverse experience — six of whom spell out “Google.” Reacting to her win, Harrison said in a statement: “When I started, I was thinking of how there’s a lot of animosity toward diverse communities of people in the world right now. So I wanted to draw something that I hoped would show that we can all get along well, and that it’s possible for us to be happy with each other.” The Bunnell High School student added: “You don’t know what they’ve been through — and they don’t know what you’ve been through — so we all deserve respect from each other.” [Winning 2016 Doodle4Google art invoking Black Lives Matter was designed by a D.C. sophomore] “E-Waste Google,” by Lucien Bell of Washington. (Google 2017) The four national finalists included Lucien Bell, a third-grader at John Eaton Elementary in the District. His sculptural artwork, titled “E-Waste Google,” was created from “a salvaged DVR.” The celebrity judges included Simone Biles, Jimmy Kimmel and Sia, as well as animation-industry talents Brenda Chapman and Floyd Norman and flights systems engineer Tracy Drain. The annual Doodle4Google contest, launched in 2008, is open to students grades kindergarten through 12; last year’s winner, Akilah Johnson of the District, won for “My Afrocentric Life.” Harrison’s victory includes $30,000 toward a college scholarship, and a meeting with the Doodle team at Google’s Bay Area headquarters. Her school will get $50,000 in technology funding.

Android Wear 2.0, first announced less than a year ago at the Google I/O 2016 developer event back in May, was originally planned for a 2016 fall launch. However, last year owners of the secong-gen Moto 360, Asus ZenWatch 3 and the original Huawei Watch were told they have to wait for their 2.0 update. We’re now clocking into April and yet again many Smartwatch owners will have to wait for the update. According to Engadget, a Google spokesperson stated that delays for the update are due to an unspecified bug found during final testing. If you are an owner of any of the watches mentioned previously there is currently no release date for the update. However, the Google spokesperson did announce that the Android Wear 2.0 update will start rolling out for the Fossil Q Founder, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F20 and Tag Heuer Connected. Although all of this might be disappointing to many Android Wear owners, Google has never actually specified an actual release date for the release of Android Wear 2.0. It’s always been very unclear when we’d start seeing the new software on our wrist. Owners of the LG Watch Style and Sport, originally announced back in February, have already been enjoying the pleasures of the 2.0 update, though the watches still have not been release in Canada. Current and future owners of Android Wear 2.0 supported devices will experience features such as Google Assistant,  a new revamped material design user-interface, a standalone Play Store and more.

Google Maps users on smartphones can access the game by opening up the Google Maps app and clicking the pink circle in the bottom right of the screen. The app transports you to a random location, turning the map blue and throwing you into a version of the game in which you must guide your yellow character around the map, eating up dots and avoiding the colourful ghosts. Credit: Google You swipe on the touchscreen to navigate around the map, and get five lives with which to clear map while outrunning your enemies. The game is fiendishly difficult - more so than the arcade classic - since the world's streets are a haphazard mess compared to the neat lines of the original Pac-Man map. You often run into dead ends and it's not clear what street you will end up when running off the side of the screen. I was wondering why google maps suddenly had a pacman setting and then I saw today's date... pic.twitter.com/bFfmKVPOWL— SHINeeFran ~FIVE~ (@fodfran) March 31, 2017 Whoa!! Pacman inside Google Maps :) pic.twitter.com/yGEh87Qcev— Karthik (@beastoftraal) March 31, 2017 It isn't the first time Google Maps has turned into Pac-Man for April Fool's Day. The idea was last tried in 2015 on the web version. Google has a long history with the game - it created a Google Doodle version of Pac-Man in 2010 to mark the arcade classic's 30th anniversary. You can still play it by typing "Pac-Man" into Google.

Given that today is Friday, the temptation to procrastinate is stronger than usual, but Google Maps has seen to it that productivity is almost certain to take a nosedive. They’ve done it before (and they can do it as often as they like as far as we’re concerned), but in honour of April Fools’ Day tomorrow, Google have added Ms. Pac-Man to Google Maps. Open up the Google Maps app on your smartphone, for example, and you will be greeted with a Ms. Pac-Man icon to start playing the game immediately on the actual map itself. Better yet, you can choose where you want to play it on the map, whether it be in the area surrounding your own home, or fancy far-flung destinations such as New York, Paris or Mullingar. Give it a go for yourself... but don't blame us if you find yourself staring at a screen come 1am lamenting having wasted a good Friday evening.

By: Lifestyle Desk | Kolkata | Published:March 31, 2017 10:28 pm From Google to Youtube, the best pranksters of the corporate world. As the month of March enters its last week, people around the world go on a prank-planning spree to surprise their friends, colleagues and family. Yes, the entire world comes together to pull of hoaxes and tricks in good jest like they do on April Fool’s Day, on April 1 every year. Beyond age and geographical barrier, this is probably as popular as the New Year celebration and if not wittier. But if you think it’s just people who dupe their friends, you are highly mistaken. April Fool’s Day is even a bigger hit in the big corporate world and many companies have teased and tickled emotions of their customers only to later reveal it was nothing but just a prank. So, as we celebrate this day of ‘fooling’ here are 10 best corporate pranks of all-time. T-Mobile’s Binging Headgear Owing to the less time available for watching and re-watching our favourite shows, binging is something we all do now. And it’s not always easy to binge while commuting to work. Taking full advantage of this weakness, T-Mobile made a promise of introducing a superb headgear only later to reveal it was an April Fool’s Day prank. In 2016, the tech brand had apparently designed a hands-free device called “Binge on Up” which would have allowed the users to binge and be productive at the same time. Alas, a hoax! Google’s Cardboard Plastic headset VR glasses are one of the biggest tech gears people around the world are excited about. So, when a company like Google decides to introduce “the world’s first actual reality headset” many missed the pun. The plastic headset designed to work with an ordinary smartphone made VR technology, completely waterproof, and 360-degree audio promised to make real look even more real! Obviously, clear plastic headgear claimed to let you “notice what you do, see, and feel more than before”. Indeed one of best April Fools prank of 2016. H&M’s Mark Zuckerberg Clothing Line Also, in 2016, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and clothing brand H&M got together to play one of the most bizarre pranks ever, well at least for a day the world thought so. A website with H&M’s logo with Zuckerberg’s face decided to troll the world with a unique collection, inspired by Facebook CEO’s dressing choice. Given the fact that he hardly opts for anything other than basic T-shirt and jeans, it was quite surprising. But as the website campaigned, “One less thing to think about in the morning”, it seemed quite Mark-like. The collection included a pair of blue jeans and 7 identical grey T-Shirts! Galaxy BLADE edge: Samsung’s smart knife If there could be smart watches and phones, then why not a smart knife, right? Describing every aspect of this Chef’s Edition special knife the tech giant went overboard. In 2015, through an elaborate blog post, the brand conceptualized the fake product and presented it to the world – it was just commendable. Many also suggested that the knife complimented the ‘edge’ design than the phone itself. However, the Sci-Fi knife that promised to retract the blade before cutting the skin was nothing but a prank. YouTube’s Rickrolling prank YouTube and Google probably have the longest history of quirkiest of pranks. But the video-sharing platform’s first prank in 2008 is probably the most cherished one. The website linked all the featured videos on its homepage to Rick Astley’s classic ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’, a 1987 music video. Yes, no matter where a person logged in to the site the website just played that particular song, a prank commonly known as Rickrolling now. Their other hit pranks include that of 2009 flip-flop prank that turned things upside down on website and text on video prank of 2010. Hotels on Moon and Mars It’s way before NASA decided to launch one-way trip to Mars. Yes, in 2009 Hotels.com and Expedia.com campaigned about hotels on Lunar and Martian soils. Hotel.com released an ad that said rooms starting at about $1,200, excluding travel cost, were available on the Moon. Taking the prank one step further, Expedia advertised hotels on Mars would start at $99! Of course, on April Fool’s Day, Mars was closer than Moon. Virgin Cola’s blue can warning Even before the 21st century, corporate companies played pranks and pulled it off brilliantly. In 1996, Virgin Cola campaigned that to ensure consumer safety their metal cans would turn blue if the drink crossed the expiration date. The brand warned everyone not to buy blue cans. And coincidentally, Pepsi had then unveiled its newly designed bright blue cans. Perfect hoax, and perfect competitive campaign. Los Angeles Airport’s prank Imagine descending from a plane and then realise that you have landed in a wrong city, like landing in Mumbai instead of Delhi. Yes, it would kick the living daylight out of someone. But this is exactly what in 1992, LA airport did. As soon as passengers started deplaning they noticed a banner that read, “welcome to Chicago”. The 85-foot-long yellow banner on the ground that spelled out in 20-foot-high red letters was hung just above the Hollywood Park race track and was visible to any arriving passenger. If you are among those who don’t remember dates, this prank could be quite shocking. BBC’s smelling aroma prank A boy watching TV with sweet teddy bear. (Source: Thinkstock) Even in mid 60’s, April Fools Day pranks were quite popular. In 1965, BBC TV aired an interview with a professor who claimed that people could smell the things shown on TV. The London University professor called the technology “smell-o-vision.” He showed coffee beans and onions and asked people to report if they smelled the items and even advised viewers to be 6-feet away from the screen for the best experience. People fell for it and some even said the onion brought tears to their eyes! Sveriges Television’s instant colour-TV Kjell Stensson shows how to place a nylon stocking over a TV screen. He posed for this photo decades after 1962. (Source: Museum of Hoax) Just colour TV is history now in the age of LED TVs and smart TVs, but even when coloured screens were introduced, a Swedish company fooled everyone with its promise. In 1962, Sveriges Television (SVT), the only television channel in Sweden announced that people would be able to view coloured images on black-and-white TV sets. Channel’s technical expert, Kjell Stensson, told viewers that they could experience the effect at home with the help of some accessible materials such as Nylon stalkings. The mesh, in this case, the Nylon material would cause the light to bend in such a way that it would appear coloured!

The failure of the American Health Care Act to make it across home plate had the minute-by-minute drama of a closely contested game, right down to the breaking news that House Speaker Paul Ryan was "rushing" to the White House to inform the president that he couldn't get the votes to pass the bill. Imagine the sighs of relief in the Senate bleachers, where the third of the membership facing elections in 2018 have escaped at least one shamefaced vote, and in the House, where any single member could win or lose the next election based on the act's drastic impact on Americans' health. The collapse of the Republicans' health care bill shows that the party has been so consumed with being against Obamacare provisions that it hasn't been able to agree on what it wants. Having mounted a strong defense against virtually every proposal from the Obama administration, the party has let its strategic offense skills atrophy. This is a humiliating lesson for the Republicans but a temporary relief for Americans who would have lost health care coverage — by estimate of the Congressional Budget Office, 24 million over the next decade. Still, Obamacare needs reform, and for that Congress needs to regroup, Some things can be predicted as coming next: Congress will move on to the next priority on the Republican agenda. Majority leaders will go back to the consensus building they thought they had achieved with the party's January meeting in Philadelphia. Ugly as this process has been to watch, it bodes some improvement for the balance of powers that exists not because of majority-minority party politics but because of the U.S. Constitution. The executive branch proposes and the legislative branch disposes or, as in this scenario, refuses to. That dynamic has seriously weakened over the last few administrations, in which frustrated presidents of both parties have used executive orders to get what Congress won't give them and have even booked major military spending — on the Iraq War, for example — outside the budget. Leading the effort to resurrect Republican unity and congressional authority, besides the bloodied Ryan, will be Sen. Mitch McConnell, who has said he won't be supporting the cuts in foreign aid and medical research in President Trump's proposed spending plan. That was a rare moment in which McConnell, the Senate's Wizard of No, said he'd use his power to block provisions constructively rather than as an obstruction. What's vital now is for citizens to keep their eyes on the next acts of Congress — not just tax-cutting or The Wall or the Supreme Court confirmation vote on Neil Gorsuch but the hearings the Trump administration would like us all to overlook. Don't be distracted. As Congress investigates the Trump campaign's ties with Russia, questioning by panel members will ripple across the campaign staff and the administration. Anyone who remembers the Watergate investigations into President Richard Nixon and his staff will notice the sense of dejà vu. As it was in the 1970s, it can be now. The hearings are bipartisan affairs in which panel members have the political cover to think of themselves as representatives of the American people first, and party members second, if they so choose. That's what happened as the Watergate hearings proceeded. If Congress can exercise its constitutional share of the balance of powers by conducting fair, open investigations into the allegations of undue influence and inappropriate contact, in the process it may regain some self-awareness of what it's like to function as a bipartisan body. And that would make reform of the health care law, the tax code and other urgent matters a lot more likely to succeed. ___ Online: http://bit.ly/2nDcgti The Kennebec Journal (Maine), March 30, 2017 Imagine if a day after calling the washing machine repairman, a salesman, tipped off by your phone company, showed up at your door, wondering if you'd like to buy a new one. Most people would consider that an egregious violation of privacy. But the same thing happens online millions of times a day — in fact, it is the backbone of the internet, generating billions of dollars for companies like Facebook and Google. Does anyone really care? Has the internet changed our very concept of privacy? Republicans are about to find out. The U.S. House this week voted largely along party lines to allow internet service providers like AT&T and Verizon to collect and sell the information generated by their customers, following a similar vote in the Senate. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill into law. The action, which repealed a set of protections created by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration, will allow browsing history, location data, app usage and other online activity to be curated into an individual profile and used to target advertising directly at a consumer, all without the consumer's consent. Websites like Facebook and Google, which fall under a different regulatory framework, have been doing this for years, making sure that when you search for a ski jacket online, you're inundated with ads for L.L. Bean and The North Face. Online advertising is an $83 billion a year business, and it is growing. Internet service providers are in a unique position to capitalize on it, if only they can get people to go along. Unlike Google, Facebook, and their affiliated sites, which internet users can avoid with a little inconvenience, internet service providers are a requirement to access the internet, and in most markets they hold a monopoly or near-monopoly. Consumers can't just switch if they don't like how their ISP is handling their personal information. And ISPs have access not only to your searches and Facebook likes, but every site you visit, every physical location you go to, and every app you use. That information is enough to create a strong profile, and advertisers want it. Consumers are unlikely to give it up, however, if ISPs have to get their explicit consent. The big telecommunication companies know this, and they lobbied Congress hard to repeal the Obama-era rules, which had yet to go into effect. Opponents of the rules, like Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, say they put ISPs at a disadvantage against websites that can sell personal information. But that doesn't explain why Republicans want to withdraw the protections, not extend them to other parts of the internet. No, this is about providing the giants in the telecommunications industry a new market. AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and others are hoping that consumers won't search for the "opt-out" option, hidden deep in their preferences, or move en masse toward services that encrypt their online actions or turn off tracking. They hope there isn't a call for more local providers that put consumers before profit. Republicans hope that this will pass unnoticed, that there is so much else to worry about in the Trump administration that this won't even be acknowledged. But most of all, they hope that as more and more of our lives are conducted online, the line between public and private becomes blurred so much that it doesn't matter. Judging from how differently we treat the telephone and the internet, they may be right. ___ Online: http://bit.ly/2nPgdvp The MetroWest Daily News of Framingham (Mass.), March 28, 2017 Not "even a scintilla of evidence." That was the judgment of a federal judge last month in Texas about allegations of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. He was not alone in finding that the health-care organization did not illegally profit from fetal-tissue donation: Three Republican-led congressional investigations, 13 states and a Texas grand jury all could find no substance to claims about the alleged sale of "baby body parts," which gained currency through videos released by anti-abortion activists. It is important to point out these facts in light of an advertising campaign that uses misleading data and half-truths in a bid to whip up support in Congress for a cutoff of federal support to Planned Parenthood. While the would-be cutters suffered a setback with last week's collapse of the Republicans' attempted overhaul of health care, which also targeted Planned Parenthood, it is clear the threat remains and that misinformation will continue to be a key weapon. "What is Planned Parenthood really about?" is the title of the slick ad that's the work of the anti- abortion group Susan B. Anthony List. The ad is effective in delivering its message - but then, it is easy to make a point if you cherry-pick information and don't worry about staying true to the facts. For example, in making the claim that Planned Parenthood has faced federal investigation for "selling baby body parts," the ad doesn't mention that the group was cleared repeatedly or that the videos that sparked the inquiries have been completely discredited. There are other distortions about breast-cancer screenings and vital health services offered at Planned Parenthood health centers. That's not to mention the omissions, such as the fact that abortions, which constitute a small part of the organization's services, are not paid for (with rare exceptions) with federal funds. The ad's most pernicious distortion centers on the argument that Congress should redirect the federal dollars that go to Planned Parenthood to "real health-care centers for women." Studies and real-life practice have established that there simply are not enough community health centers to fill the gap that would be created if Planned Parenthood lost Medicaid funds. The truth is that a cutoff would tear a huge hole in the safety net for the 2.5 million patients - the majority of them low-income - who each year go to Planned Parenthood centers for basic medical needs. Congress should reject it. ___ Online: http://bit.ly/2nP85v0 The Concord Monitor (N.H.), March 29, 2017 It's time to pay Uncle again. All over the nation people are searching for mislaid W2 forms, bank statements, receipts from charitable giving and other proofs demanded by the IRS in order to meet the April 15 tax deadline. Some will make mistakes. Some will cheat, minimizing income or inflating deductions. But the odds of catching the cheats aren't good and, with his call to cut the IRS budget by $239 million, President Donald Trump promises to make matters worse. Who pays when taxpayers get away with paying less than their fair share? Honest people, especially working stiffs whose tax payments come off the top, and future generations, who will inherit a national debt that's bigger than it needs to be. It's no surprise that Trump considers the IRS a mortal enemy. Historically, Republican officeholders, in Washington and in Concord, have favored fewer rather than more tax collectors. In 2010, during the reign of House Speaker Bill O'Brien, Republicans slashed the budget of the Department of Revenue Administration, a move that cost the state tens of millions of dollars. The same will happen on a grand scale if the IRS's battered budget is further reduced. According to Trump's own Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, the IRS has 30 percent fewer employees than it did less than a decade ago. Audit rates for large corporations fell by nearly half in the last six years, from 17.8 percent to 9.5 percent. Less than 1 percent of all individual returns were audited last year, according to the Washington Post. Funding for IRS enforcement operations also suffered deep cuts. The shortfall between what the Treasury was owed and what it was able to collect tops $450 billion per year, a sum that law school professor Dennis Ventry, writing in the New York Times, said equaled 80 percent of last year's budget deficit. Collectively, taxpayers will spend more than 6 billion hours to comply with the federal tax code, reason enough, one would think, to simplify the code and make it fairer. That effort is once again underway in Washington but, given the chaos in Congress and the inexperience of Trump and his team, real progress seems unlikely. More than two-thirds of all taxpayers (68.5 percent, according to the IRS) take the standard deduction. As a result, they have little opportunity, short of earning off-the-books money, to cheat. Less than one-third of all households, 30.1 percent, itemize deductions. They tend to have higher incomes. In 2013, the agency said, 93.5 percent of filers with incomes of $200,000 or more itemized. In his confirmation hearings, Mnuchin said that he wanted to increase, not decrease, IRS funding and staff levels. "We add people, we make money," he said. As a businessman, the president should understand that. He wants more money for defense. He wants to build his border wall. He promised a $1 trillion plan to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. Firing tax collectors will make it harder to achieve any of those goals, and it will make the nation's tax collection system less fair. The IRS collects $6 for every $1 spent on auditors and enforcement. The president should listen to his treasury secretary and add to - not cut - the IRS budget. ___ Online: http://bit.ly/2nz6gjT The Providence Journal (R.I.), March 27, 2017 Republicans asked for trouble last year when they flat-out refused to consider President Obama's nomination of the eminently qualified Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court after the death of Antonin Scalia. They were wrong to effectively steal the seat from the Democrats, on the spurious grounds that it was an election year and voters should first have their say in November. Even so, it is sad to see so many Democratic senators this year — including Rhode Island's own Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse — choosing to turn the Senate's duty of weighing Supreme Court nominations into a purely partisan exercise. One of the reasons voters choose a president is to make appointments to the Supreme Court. It has traditionally been the job of the Senate to vet nominations for the court not for politics, but to ensure the candidate is qualified and basically honest. This is one of the checks on executive power the Founders put into the Constitution. For many years, senators from both parties took this responsibility seriously. Unfortunately, the Senate has devolved into intensely politicizing every choice. That does not serve the public well. It is painfully obvious that President Trump's nomination for the open seat, Neil Gorsuch, is qualified for the job. Unanimously supported for the federal bench by the Senate, he holds a law degree from Harvard and a doctorate in jurisprudence from Oxford. As a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit for the past 10 years, he has established himself as a fair-minded jurist who focuses on the law rather than flex his personal preferences. The American Bar Association deemed him "well-qualified" for the Supreme Court, its highest rating. Mr. Gorsuch seems to be scrupulously honest and non-political. A fierce advocate of judicial independence, he criticized the very man who nominated him — Donald Trump — for blasting judges who ruled against some recent executive orders. Over 20 grueling hours of hearings last week, he sounded thoughtful and moderate. "His performance was skilled and schooled. He looked the part of a distinguished, white-haired but youthful, judge, and projected an image of dispassionate judicial neutrality to the point of chilliness," NPR's Nina Totenberg, hardly a conservative, wrote. Yet Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer announced March 23 that he would oppose Mr. Gorsuch, threatening to lead a filibuster against him. In the early going, 16 Democratic senators — including Rhode Island's pair — came out against Judge Gorsuch. The approach seems designed to play to the base, and all-important campaign contributors, rather than to serve the nation. It is fraught with peril. Republicans have already threatened that if Democrats reflexively filibuster Mr. Gorsuch, they will extend the "nuclear option" on other judicial nominations to the Supreme Court — meaning a simple majority vote is all it would take to confirm. This would be taking the Senate down the wrong path. The filibuster, which effectively requires 60 votes to confirm, should be saved for nominees who are extreme or unqualified. If it is used to threaten any nominee chosen by an opposing party, no matter how highly qualified or neutral he or she is, it will cease to fulfill its important function and quickly end up on the scrap heap. That could invite presidents to nominate more overtly political justices. We do not want to see the day come when no Democratic president can get a nominee confirmed if Republicans hold the Senate, or vice versa. There was a reason for the Senate's traditions. Today's politicians should start behaving in a more responsible manner. ___ Online: http://bit.ly/2nJWqgP The Rutland Herald (Vt.), March 29, 2017 Todd Stern, chief negotiator for the United States at the Paris climate conference, has a question for climate change deniers in the Trump administration: "What if you're wrong?" Stern was speaking March 24 at an environmental conference in Burlington, where he described the arduous process that led to the Paris climate accord. He called the climate pact a "paradigm shift" in the global effort to curb the carbon emissions that are causing climate change. At the same time he warned of the dangers to the international effort if President Trump carries out promised actions to reverse progress on climate change achieved by the Obama administration. Trump took one of those actions March 28, signing an executive order to roll back one of President Barack Obama's most important climate change initiatives — the Clean Power Plan. It was the rule requiring coal-burning power plants to employ technology curbing carbon emissions or shut down. Trump wants to end that mandate, freeing plants to burn coal with impunity and without regard to carbon emissions. It's part of his plan to bring jobs back to coal country. But even leaders of the coal industry say that the Trump changes are unlikely to bring back coal jobs. Coal has fallen into disfavor among power companies because of the abundance of natural gas, which is cheaper. The Clean Power Plan, together with more stringent mileage standards for U.S. cars and trucks, formed an essential part of the climate change strategy that the United States had adopted to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord. Stern warned that for the United States to abandon its goals would cause "huge collateral damage with respect to other foreign policy goals." More than 190 nations have signed on to the Paris accord. Significantly, these include China, the largest emitter of carbon dioxide. For the United States to back out threatens to unravel the entire international effort and alienate Western allies, as well as nations such as China, with whom we had made significant progress on the climate challenge. Trump has filled his administration with climate change deniers, such as Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, whom Stern described as "untethered to reality." That description would also apply to Trump, who has referred to climate change as a "hoax." The U. S. military, on the other hand, has described climate change as a serious threat to national security because upheavals likely to be caused by drought and other climate disasters are likely to lead to international conflict and war. In fact, they have already done so in Syria. Stern was preaching to the choir last Friday — to a gathering of Vermonters at the Leahy Center for Lake Champlain for whom the need to protect the environment and meet the challenges of climate change appeared to be a given. The damage that Trump promises to do could have been cause for despair among this group, except for some of the positive developments that Stern outlined. He pointed to the heightened activism occurring throughout the nation on energy issues. California has the sixth-largest economy among the nations of the world, and it has taken a leadership role in developing clean energy and in resisting Trump. "The states matter," Stern said. That would include small states like Vermont. Cities also matter, he said. Seventy-five percent of U.S. emissions come from urban areas, he said, and the cities are showing "enormous dynamism," he said. Further, the clean energy industry has shown rapid growth — the wind industry growing by three times and the solar industry by 23 times since 2009. The renewable energy industry already employs more people than the oil, gas and coal industry combined. Trump's action Tuesday is likely to ignite a new round of grassroots fury as Americans across the land find new ways to resist his efforts to trash the planet in order to further the agenda of the plutocrats who are his only true constituency. Trump may be weak politically, but he is already doing major damage. That is why the opposition must redouble its efforts to resist him at every turn. ___ Online: http://bit.ly/2okJ5cK Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:41 Mississippi Bicentennial South kicks off with a tribute to the blues Pause 1:12 Edgewater Mall adds lots more fun 1:45 Gulfport woman helps marshalls catch fugitive 0:51 Sophia Myers thanks the Coast 2:12 Ocean Springs boutique hotel 2:26 Biloxi clinic helps under-insured and uninsured 1:02 His Pepsi truck got stuck.

(Photo credit: ANGELO MERENDINO/AFP/Getty Images)    Uber Exec Refuses To Testify After Google Sues Company For Stealing Self-Driving Tech Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 12:47 PM 03/31/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5566304 Uber executive Anthony Levandowski is choosing to assert his Fifth Amendment rights during legal proceedings, after the self-driving car arm of Google parent corporation Alphabet filed a lawsuit against the ride-sharing company for stealing classified data. Lawyers advised Levandowski not say anything out of fear of incriminating himself, according to Business Insider. Levandowski, who is the co-founder of Otto, Uber’s driverless vehicle subsidiary, was one of the original members of Waymo, Google’s driverless car initiative. He is considered one of the premier engineers in Silicon Valley, especially for autonomous vehicle technology. (RELATED: Uber, Anheuser-Busch Use Self-Driving Truck To Deliver 45,000 Cans Of ‘America’) Waymo accuses Levandowski of downloading “over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo’s various hardware systems” roughly six weeks prior to resigning from the company. It also claims that he downloaded several files that include trade secrets and blueprints, as well as trying to poach employees to come join him just before quitting. “Ultimately, this calculated theft reportedly netted Otto employees over half a billion dollars and allowed Uber to revive a stalled program, all at Waymo’s expense,” the official lawsuit reads. Uber purchased Otto for $680 million only six months after Levandowski established the startup, according to The New York Times. Before the lawsuit, Waymo originally wanted to settle the case outside of court through official arbitration, according to a recent Reuters report. (RELATED: Big Tech Always Ends Up With Big Lawsuits) Such lawsuits are not uncommon. The tech conglomerate Tesla filed a lawsuit against a former executive, alleging the staff member stole confidential data and tried to shepherd other employees towards a self-driving startup he was spearheading.

Search Watch Live Home UK Brexit Trump World Business Politics Tech Entertainment Offbeat Weather Google reveals it paid £36.4m in UK corporation tax in 2015/16 The internet giant, currently at the centre of an advertising row in the UK, says its tax contribution to the country has leaped. 00:01, UK, Saturday 01 April 2017 Image: Google struck a controversial deal with the taxman last year Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail Google says it paid £36.4m in UK corporation tax in the last financial year, as the internet firm's operations in this country remain mired in controversy. The US company, which was revealed early last year to have done a £130m deal with the taxman covering 10 years of business, is also at the centre of a more current row over hate videos that has led to a boycott by advertisers. The financial settlement with HMRC - hailed as a victory at the time by then-Chancellor George Osborne - was described by Google as paying the full 20% rate due on its UK profits. However, critics said the sum was "derisory" given its revenues. Google reported on Friday that it paid £36.4m on pre-tax profits of £148.8m in the year to 30 June. Revenues fell to £1bn, it said. That compared to a £46.2m bill covering the previous 18 months. A spokesman said: "As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. "We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff." The debate over tax avoidance for multi-national firms, amid an effort to bring new international rules, has centred on forcing companies such as Google, Facebook and Starbucks to book profits in the countries where they are made. The Lib Dem shadow chancellor, Susan Kramer, claimed Google was shirking its responsibilities. "It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes. "This Government is already struggling with the Brexit squeeze, if they want to stop cutting vital services they need to start picking up what is owed to the British people. "The Government seem to be letting big online businesses off the hook, while small businesses, the heart of our high streets get whacked by ever increasing business rates. It's totally and utterly unfair."

Like last year, we’ll be covering all the gag products and services from Google and Alphabet, as well as the best ones from the rest of the tech industry. Nintendo Switch Google Maps Ms. Pac-Man Google’s first April Fools’ product is the ability to play Ms. Pac-Man in Maps. Available on both desktop and mobile, it does not appear to be live for most of the world. When available, a new pink FAB or map layer will appear and allow users to play Pac-Man anywhere in the world. After tapping, you will be launched into a retro black facelift of your current locale and street. Game stats are located at the bottom of the screen with controls achieved through swiping. While a rehash of 2015’s joke and a Google Doodle, this classic game never gets old. Google Gnome Playing off Google Home is Google Gnome. An assistant for your smart yard, but with a darker, morbid personality that hints at a shred of self-awareness. Anyways, it’s basically a speaker with a colorful skin and a pointy hat, though there are multiple variants. Google Wind This moonshot aims to combat Holland’s 145 days of rain a year by leveraging the Google Cloud Platform to control the weather. Specifically, machine learning is used to recognize cloud patterns and then control a network of 1170 windmills to blow away approaching storms. Google VR Haptic Helpers It turns out that humans are still better at certain tasks than robots. That’s why Google turned to human helpers in order to deliver and cater to your other sense of taste, touch, and smell while in virtual reality. Sign up to be a beta tester on the official page. Google Cloud Platform expands to Mars With the “exploration and ultimate colonization” of Mars requiring massive amounts of infrastructure and computing, Google announced plans to open its first “dedicated extraterrestrial cloud region.” Launching in 2018, the “Ziggy Stardust” data center will allow users to store planet-redundant data across Earth and Mars. Google notes that this is for: if Earth experiences another asteroid strike like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs, your cat videos, selfies and other data will still be safe. Of course, we’ll also store all public domain scientific data, history and arts free of charge so that the next global catastrophe doesn’t send humanity back into the dark ages. Additionally, there are options to “store data exclusively in the new Mars region, outside of any controlled jurisdictions on Earth, ensuring that they’re both compliant with and benefit from the terms of the Outer Space Treaty.” New line of mobile accessories for Chromebooks With Chromebooks now able to run Android Apps, they are essentially mobile devices. As such, Google is making a new line of mobile accessories for Chrome OS devices, including a Groupie Stick, Chromebook Cardboard, and a Workout Armband Samsung Exynos Yoga Processor Can’t help but feel that is a slight nod to the rumors of a foldable smartphone from the company later this year. We are proud to introduce #ExynosYogaProcessor for flexible mobile devices! pic.twitter.com/FrFzHDghbV — Samsung Exynos (@SamsungExynos) March 31, 2017 OnePlus Dash Energy OnePlus makes bold claims, but I’d buy their battery tech-inspired energy drink in a heartbeat if performance was anywhere near as touted: It’s the end of 8 hours of sleep a day. All you need for a day’s power in half an hour is a single can of Dash Energy. This is achieved through the DASH Energy Augmentation Component, “a neural performance enhancer that triggers an immediate increase in alertness, energy, and concentration levels.” T-Mobile ONEsie Showcasing their flagship mobile plan and love of magenta, the T-Mobile ONEsie is a smart wearable embedded with sensors, is “Bluetooth enabled,” and doubles as a hotspot. Also, points for being self-aware about fitness wearables: “Real-time micro monitoring gives you unparalleled access to the detailed bio data you couldn’t possibly need or ever hope to comprehend.” iFixit Micro Tech Toolkit With devices getting smaller and smaller, iFixit’s repair solution is to join in on the trend. Their new Micro Tech Toolkit, available for $19.95, shrinks down their Pro Tech Toolkit, but will likely be made obsolete by next year’s Nano Tech Toolkit. Amazon Echo with Petlexa Following a massive scientific breakthrough, the Amazon Echo now understands animals.

The company is also investing $5 million into the new Vector Institute AI research facility. Nintendo Switch Canada is increasingly a center for AI research, with the Google division responsible for breakthroughs in speech recognition and image classification already having an office in Montreal. While that outpost is focused on basic research, Google Brain Toronto will focus on the “biggest research challenges facing AI.” Also in the city is the new Vector Institute housed at the University of Toronto. Similar to Google Brain, the research facility is focusing on “expanding the applications of AI by performing cutting-edge explorations in deep learning and other forms of machine learning.” Fields that could benefit include healthcare, financial services and advanced manufacturing. Google is contributing $5 million, with the initiative being guided by chief scientific adviser Geoffrey Hinton, a VP and Engineering Fellow at the company. The bulk of the total $150 million funding is coming from the Canadian and Ontario governments, as well as other corporate funders. This commitment to research comes as Google invested $4.5 million back in November in another Canadian institute working on AI.

Comparing the multinational super company's numbers to those reported by Debenhams James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Friday 31 March 2017 17:23 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Google paid £36.4m in UK corporation tax last year On a Friday afternoon, when no one’s paying all that much attention to business news, it emerges that tech and media superstar Google booked sales of £1.03bn in Britain last year, netting a profit of £149m and yielding tax of £36.4m for Britain’s battered exchequer.  Does that look low to you, given that this is a global giant, one of the world’s biggest and brightest companies? It does to me. It certainly does to the Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Kramer, who serves as the party’s Shadow Chancellor.  “It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes,” she said, accusing the Government of “letting big online business off the hook”.  Read more Boris Johnson calls Google ‘disgusting’ for extremist content Google just launched a programme to teach black students to code Verizon, AT&T and Johnson & Johnson suspend advertising on Google But is she right? Am I right? Here’s what Google has to say on the subject: “As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff.” Not that the latter is at all relevant to the discussion in hand. The investment is great. Thanks guys! But we’re talking taxes.  So, back to that subject, and the question of which of the three of us is right.  Just for fun I decided to look at a, shall we say, slightly less starry company. I picked from the second tier FTSE 250 index, because, as I said, Google's numbers look low to me, and so I thought it might be interesting to compare them to those reported by one of the stock exchange's second division.  I chose Debenhams, because it happened to catch my eye, and it’s a medium sized business that is relatively simple to understand.  For its last full trading year, to September 3, Debs reported UK revenues of £2.4bn, more than twice what Google reported. It made operating profits of £98m on those sales, and total pre tax profits for the group as a whole (it has a small international business) of £105.8m. On that, the company paid £21.6m, in tax.  That would suggest that Google is paying about what it should pay, a bit more, as a percentage of its profits, than Debs pays. Perhaps it needs a new accountant! And perhaps it shows that Baroness Kramer and me have got this badly wrong.  On the other hand, super duper, whizzy wonder company Google is reporting less than half the UK revenues that Debenhams reports. Debenhams! I know they’re in very different industries, but even so, I was left scratching my head over that one.  Of course, the difference between Debs and Google is that the latter is a multi national giant, with a bewildering array of businesses, operating companies and legal entities in a bewildering array of countries, all with wildly different tax rates.  As has become clear in recent years, big companies have a certain amount of choice when it comes to where they book revenues and where they book profits.

They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government. Governments are committing resources to green energy in a bid to keep warming within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), of pre-industrial conditions, in accordance with the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming.

The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion. Paramount 3/37 John Lewis cuts staff bonuses to lowest in 63 years despite soaring profits - Thursday March 9 John Lewis has cut its employee bonus to the lowest level in more than 60 years despite announcing surging profits. The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market. Reuters 4/37 Philip Hammond downgrades UK economic growth for Brexit years - Wednesday March 8 The Chancellor was forced to slash his official economic growth forecasts while the Brexit talks take place, as he delivered his first Budget.

Getty 7/37 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 8/37 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 11/37 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Reuters Work is being done on finding ways to better link what they report to where their economic activity actually takes place, but it isn't always very easy with big and complicated multinational companies, and we’re a way off getting to a definitive solution.  The EU has brought cases against some multinationals over their tax affairs, including Apple and Starbucks, but Google, and its owner Alphabet, are not among their number. Nor would I suggest that the company has done anything illegal.  The numbers are the numbers. They just look low when compared to Debenhams. So perhaps the Baroness has a point. One thing we can be sure of.

Some doctors have confessed to doing online searches about their patients. An Australian survey of how doctors use social media found that one in six (16%) had gone online to look for information about a patient. That’s about the same figure for doctors in the US and Canada. That’s awkward – here’s hoping they aren’t seeing all those drinking photos or the sunbaking snaps. Some of the doctors said they used Google to find out more information about their patients and to discover the “truth” which they said can help them better care for their patients and improve their health. But other doctors admitted they turned to Google simply out of curiosity, voyeurism or habit. Surprisingly, when doctors were asked if it was appropriate for them to look up publicly available information about a patient, almost 43% said no and around 40% were unsure. All this raises obvious ethical concerns. While in some cases a doctor Googling a patient could be helpful in regards to say, whether a patient that has depression and is crying out for help online, the information doctors could find may also be inaccurate. More than 50% of adolescents admitted to posting false information on social media. And this raises another dilemma. If a doctor sees photos of a patient drinking – and that patient is waiting for a liver transplant – would that change the doctor’s decision to help that patient? Googling a patient also raises concerns about the breach of trust. Would you feel OK going back to your GP if you knew they had been searching for you?

As soon as you swipe in any direction, the game starts.      You can only play the game using the app on a mobile phone – it won’t work on your computer’s browser. Pro tip: Try playing where there are plenty of roads. Highway 7 near Carleton Place doesn’t give you many options. In past years, Google has unveiled pranks including YouTube SnoopaVision, a Google self-driving bike, Gmail Mic Drop (which didn’t go over so well in the business world) and Google Actual Cloud Platform.       Google Inc.

Google App v6.16 beta prepares to add authentication to purchases with Assistant, video previews in search results, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/03/30 1:36pm PDTMar 30, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 63 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares131 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Video previews and auto-play 1.2 code 1.3 User-defined actions, meet IFTTT 1.4 code 1.5 Prevent accidental and unauthorized purchases (on phones) 1.6 code 1.7 Toggle for auto-added app icons 2 Download A new version of the Google app began rolling out earlier this week, but there don't appear to be any major changes going live quite yet. However, this version does bring some big clues about upcoming changes. On the docket for this teardown is a new authentication step for purchases made through Google Assistant, video previews in search results, user-defined actions take form through IFTTT, and some people will be happy to find out that Google's launcher won't always add icons for newly installed apps. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Video previews and auto-play These days, it's pretty common to perform a Google search and get back more than just a page of links to websites. In fact, it's almost weird not to get back at least a few video suggestions, image results, or even knowledge graph info. With regular results, you'll see text previews that tell you what to expect when you get to a page. However, videos don't afford the same clues about what you're going to get, only a thumbnail, and it's usually chosen by the creator. That's going to change as Google prepares to show video previews in search results. The evidence for video previews actually comes in the form of a new setting (not currently live) that will allow users to turn video previews off. Seeing as people aren't actually seeing video previews in search results, this is a pretty good hint of what's to come. This wouldn't be Google's first foray into showing video previews, it actually became a feature on the web search results around early 2011. Users could click on a little magnifying glass for "instant previews" of pages and videos. That feature vanished at some point, but there's no denying that it can be pretty useful. code <string name="video_preference_title">Video</string> <string name="video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data_title">Network</string> <string name="video_preview_autoplay_on_wifi_preference_desc">Play video previews automatically on Wi-Fi</string> <string name="enable_video_preview_autoplay">Autoplay</string> <string name="enable_video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data">Allow on mobile networks</string> <string name="enable_video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data_preference">enableVideoPreviewAutoplayOnMobileDataPreference</string> <string name="enable_video_preview_autoplay_preference">enableVideoPreviewAutoplayPreference</string> <string name="enable_video_preview_network_preference_category">enableVideoPreviewNetworkPreferenceCategory</string> /res/xml/video_preference_header.xml <preference-headers xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <header android:id="@id/video_header" android:title="@string/video_preference_title" android:fragment="com.google.android.apps.gsa.staticplugins.videopreference.VideoPreferenceFragment" /> </preference-headers> /res/xml/video_preference.xml <PreferenceScreen android:id="@id/video_preference_screen" xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <SwitchPreference android:persistent="false" android:title="@string/enable_video_preview_autoplay" android:key="@string/enable_video_preview_autoplay_preference" android:summary="@string/video_preview_autoplay_on_wifi_preference_desc" android:defaultValue="true" /> <PreferenceCategory android:title="@string/video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data_title" android:key="@string/enable_video_preview_network_preference_category"> <SwitchPreference android:persistent="false" android:title="@string/enable_video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data" android:key="@string/enable_video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data_preference" android:defaultValue="false" /> </PreferenceCategory> </PreferenceScreen> I won't go into making predictions about web results, but it's pretty clear mobile users are going to see video previews when they use Google's search bar. How will they work and what will they look like? That I can't say for sure, but the evidence strongly suggests they'll actually auto-play, which means the thumbnails will probably disappear shortly after coming into view and frames of the video will begin running. I assume they won't begin playing audio, because that would be horrible. The auto-play setting all of this is based upon will obviously be useful for turning this feature off, which you may want to do for data conservation, or if you simply find sudden motion annoying. Wi-Fi and cellular connections can be enabled or disabled individually, but the defaults are naturally set so only Wi-Fi is enabled when this feature goes live. The one thing I notice that's missing is a way to start a preview if the auto-play setting is switched off. Perhaps this isn't included in the app itself, but will be delivered as part of Google's results, or maybe that's not actually going to be a feature, but it leads me to think Google might not be ready to launch this quite yet. User-defined actions, meet IFTTT Back in August, shortly after Google Assistant code first appeared in public releases, we got a look at the early stages of user-defined actions. When launch day came, there was no obvious sign that this feature had actually made the cut, nor were there many changes to any related text or resources since then. That is, until now. New strings reveal that Google is integrating the popular IFTTT (If-This-Then-That) service to handle custom user actions. code <string name="user_defined_action_ifttt_action_section_title">IFTTT actions</string> <string name="user_defined_action_menu_save_button">Save</string> <string name="user_defined_action_paused_action_section_title">Paused actions</string> <string name="user_defined_action_speech_recognition_prompt_text">When I say Okay Google…</string> <string name="user_defined_action_target_command_hint">Google Assistant should do</string> <string name="user_defined_action_action_list_section_title">Learned actions</string> <string name="user_defined_action_create_action_section_title">Teach your assistant to…</string> <string name="user_defined_action_create_do_action_title">Do something</string> <string name="user_defined_action_create_ifttt_action_title">Create IFTTT action</string> <string name="user_defined_action_create_say_action_title">Say something</string> <string name="user_defined_action_delete_confirmation_cancel_text">CANCEL</string> <string name="user_defined_action_delete_confirmation_delete_text">DELETE</string> <string name="user_defined_action_delete_confirmation_text">Are you sure you want to delete this action?</string> New Layouts /res/layout/assistant_user_defined_action_do_editor_layout.xml /res/layout/assistant_user_defined_action_say_editor_layout.xml New preference screen /res/xml/user_defined_action_preference_screen.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.CustomPreferenceCategory android:key="@string/assistant_settings_create_action_header_key" android:order="0" /> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.CustomPreferenceCategory android:key="@string/assistant_settings_active_action_category_key" android:order="1" /> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.CustomPreferenceCategory android:key="@string/assistant_settings_paused_action_category_key" android:order="2" /> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.CustomPreferenceCategory android:key="@string/assistant_settings_ifttt_action_category_key" android:order="3" /> </PreferenceScreen> <string name="assistant_settings_active_action_category_key">assistantSettingsUserDefinedActionActiveActionsCategoryKey</string> <string name="assistant_settings_create_action_header_key">assistantSettingsUserDefinedActionCreateActionHeaderKey</string> <string name="assistant_settings_ifttt_action_category_key">assistantSettingsUserDefinedActionIFTTTActionsCategoryKey</string> <string name="assistant_settings_paused_action_category_key">assistantSettingsUserDefinedActionPausedActionsCategoryKey</string> This might feel a bit anticlimactic since many of us have already been using IFTTT with Google Assistant. There's no reason to expect changes to that base functionality, Google is simply building a native interface for creating these actions. On the plus side, it means we don't have to use IFTTT's website... And that's definitely a good thing. (It's not a great site.) ifttt_logo There are also no clues to indicate how capable these actions are going to be. IFTTT's "Applets" are effectively made up of two parts: a service that triggers an event, and the action that is performed in response. In this case, the trigger is obviously going to be Google Assistant, and it will listen for a user-defined phrase. What isn't clear is how much control users will have to define the resulting actions; basically, if they'll have the same range of services and options for configurability as they would on the site, or if the interface will offer a limited set of options. Prevent accidental and unauthorized purchases (on phones) Purchases made through voice-activated gadgets have been a bit of a hot topic lately, particularly thanks to a series of incidents involving the Amazon Echo. A few weeks ago, Google Assistant gained some similar shopping capabilities; and while there haven't been any reports of accidental or unauthorized purchases yet, it's only a matter of time unless something is done to prevent it. Google is already working on a solution. According to new text in the app, users will soon have the option to require an additional authentication step before purchases can be completed. At this time, the only standard method of authentication is a fingerprint, which should be enough for most people. Of course, if you are using a device without a fingerprint reader, or chose not to set up a fingerprint for use on your phone, this won't do much for you. It's also noted that if authentication is set to not be required, "suspicious behavior" may still trigger a check. If this happens, it looks like a password will be necessary to complete the purchase. code <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_title">Authentication</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_section_title">Purchases on this device</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_page_header">Adjust settings for authentication when making purchases using Google Assistant on this device.</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_dialog_message">Confirm with password.</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_mechanism_title">Fingerprint authentication</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_mechanism_description">Allow your fingerprint to be used as authentication for Google Assistant purchases on this device.</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_frequency_title">Purchase authentication</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_frequency_always">Confirmation required</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_frequency_always_required">Required for every purchase</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_frequency_never">Confirmation not required</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_frequency_never_description">We may ask if suspicious behavior is detected</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_frequency_not_required">Not required</string> <string name="assistant_settings_payments_phone_authentication_frequency_not_required_detail">We may ask if suspicious behavior is detected</string> New Layouts /res/layout/assistant_payments_phone_authentication_entry.xml /res/layout/assistant_payments_phone_authentication_item.xml /res/layout/assistant_payments_phone_authentication_template.xml This feature is intended to be specific to each device, which currently means it's directed at phones. It's safe to assume there's a plan for Google Home and other voice-only appliances using Assistant, but there's nothing visible yet to indicate how that will work. I would expect a proper solution is still pending the rollout of multiple accounts on Home, at which point the signed-in users will all probably be able to perform the authentication steps on their phones to complete purchases started on Home. This should hopefully put an end to any concerns about accidental and unauthorized purchases resulting from misunderstood conversations, ambient noise, demanding children, or friends with a penchant for pranks. Toggle for auto-added app icons Finally, we get to one of those little features that seem simple, but many people are bothered to no end if they aren't available. I'm talking about the launcher's behavior of automatically adding an icon to a home screen when a new app is installed. Most third-party launchers offer users the freedom to disable this, and it's hit-and-miss for OEMs. Google's launcher counts among the ranks that doesn't give users a choice, but that's about to change. <string name="auto_add_shortcuts_label">Add icon to Home screen</string> <string name="auto_add_shortcuts_description">For new apps</string> From /xml/launcher_preferences.xml <SwitchPreference android:persistent="true" android:title="@string/auto_add_shortcuts_label" android:key="pref_add_icon_to_home" android:summary="@string/auto_add_shortcuts_description" android:defaultValue="true" /> There's not really much more to say about this other than it's placement, which will be at the bottom of the Settings screen alongside the toggles for app suggestions and allow rotation. I'm not sure why it wasn't already activated in this release, but maybe Google is waiting to roll it out remotely at some point in the near future.

Isn't it the same function? Suicide_Note That's what i was thinking too. F4LL0U7 Came here to say the same thing. Is there anyone that doesn't already uncheck that box immediately when setting up a new device? Not sure I'd expect to rely on the launcher for that. Also might cause confusion if it's enabled in one place but disabled in the other. abqnm Some third party launchers have their own independent system that doesn't rely on the Play Store setting. But Google and a few third party launchers respect that option. I guess the only thing that's really new here is that it would be an option in the settings for the Google launchers. bekifft Would be nice if they'd implement app shortcuts. Cody Toombs That's already there, but it only works on Android 7.1 and above. bekifft Well that's weird cause I have a Nexus 6P running latest software, all I get are "edit" and "remove". Pan Szym True destinyhud then u r not using google now launcher bekifft No that's true, I'm using Nova, but on literally all sides of the Google app icon are icons with working app shortcuts, some of them are even Google apps. Keep, Chrome, Phone, etc. destinyhud Nova has to implement ur app shortcut. the api to enable shortcut is there but if your launcher app didn't implement it you wont see it. Google now launcher which comes with the 6p has app shortcut enabled for most of google apps Cody Toombs Oh, you meant you want the Google app to have app shortcuts. I thought you were asking for the Google launcher to support them (since plenty of people are still confused by how that works). So my question is... What shortcuts do you think it's supposed to have? I can't think of very many things I'd want to have in the app, short of possibly a quick way to reach Settings. bekifft Reminders is the big one for me. If they'd just add that it would be good. Lion5 I have Android 6x on my Galaxy Note 5 and with Nova, App shortcuts seem to work with quite a few apps. Most are the basic edit, remove, etc, but some like Google's apps offer more shortcuts.

Alessandro I thought Google Now Launcher was removed from the available google apps package that OEMs can include to ship with and therefore was discontinued. Wasn't GNL supposed to be removed from the playstore soon? Lucas de Eiroz ™ Remember, now we have Pixel Launcher too. These changes are for Pixel and not GNL.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Mar 31, 2017 at 11:17AM In this segment from Market Foolery, Chris Hill welcomes Motley Fool analysts Jason Moser and Taylor Muckerman to the show as they consider the problems that come with being the largest site in the world for user-generated video. YouTube is algorithmically dependent, but Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has yet to come up with the internal controls that can prevent ads from major partners popping up next to videos with objectionable or offensive content. Keep in mind these are some of the world's biggest companies -- who have begun pulling advertising dollars -- so the question is not a matter of if this problem can be fixed, but how much Google will spend to fix it and how quickly. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 27, 2017. Chris Hill: We have to start with a story that's been brewing for a little while. I'll be honest. This is a story, I saw a headline on this a week or two ago, and it registered like, huh, that's interesting, and it continues to balloon. This is the fact that a week ago, Google formally apologized for running customer's ads alongside objectionable videos. We've talked before about YouTube and how important it is in the world of search, and how it's one of the most popular places to search. And you see these stories about, if YouTube was a stand-alone company, it'd be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 billion. Google makes this apology a week ago, and here we are a week later, and I guess, among other things, Jason, probably a reminder that YouTube is a really big place with lots of videos, and therefore it's hard even for the owners to monitor it. The Wall Street Journal had this big story about how Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Amazon, Procter & Gamble, these mainstream brands, are still seeing their ads alongside videos with racist content, anti-Semitic, all of this stuff where the advertisers, rightfully so, say, "I don't want my ads next to that." Jason Moser: Yeah. We're going to hit a point here, sooner or later, it's going to be like you do with your kids, they can say sorry only so many times before you're like, "I get that you're sorry. Just don't do it again. I'm not looking for sorry anymore." So, I think with Google and YouTube, this is obviously something that's a big deal. It's not something that immediately impacts their bottom line. When we talk about the bread and butter for Google's money-making machine, it's search advertising. But, there's a good percentage, close to 20% of that money, comes through advertising with third-party customers. So, when ads go next to objectionable content, of course, those parties are going to express concern, they want to know what's going on, why is this happening, and what are you going to do to make it stop? Because there is no middle ground here. It's just, flat-out, "This is unacceptable, don't let it happen anymore." This is sort of one of those things with this age of automation, as we go more toward automating everything, particularly on the consumer-facing side, I think it's really difficult to ever fall back on the old, "Well, the algorithm did it, it wasn't our fault." Because, ultimately, someone built the algorithm.  I think what Google needs to figure out here is, what is happening to make this happen, and how do they fix it? And whether it is through technology, whether it's through humanizing it a little bit more, and actually bringing on more people to add a human touch to these customer relationships, they need to do something with this before this gets out of hand. We've talked about this a lot, especially in MDP, we own shares of Alphabet, and we own shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB): We own a far larger position in Facebook, and part of the reason for that is, when you look at the direction things are headed in social, and in internet behavior, there's no question that Facebook is becoming a place, not just Facebook, but its properties, whether it's WhatsApp or Instagram or whatever properties they buy in the future, that's a place where eyeballs go to hang out for a while. Google is more utilitarian in nature, right? You need some information, you find it on Google, and you go to your next place. Facebook is catching up very quickly. They've expressed some concerns that perhaps the last decade was the Google decade, and perhaps this next decade is the Facebook decade. If that is the case, and the numbers certainly point toward that, the argument could at least be made there, Google has got to figure out something yesterday as to how to address this and fix it, because blaming it on the technology is not going to fly. Taylor Muckerman: I'm pretty confident that they're going to figure out a way to fix it. Especially when you're talking about Facebook, they had the whole issue around the election with fake news on their site. And you had a group of college kids come out and make an algorithm that was able to identify fake news on the site, and they've been able -- not using their algorithm, but, Facebook has been able to address that. I'm confident that Google will. You talk about big headlines about this, but I'm waiting for the headline to come out that says, right now, people think that less than 1% of Google's revenue is at risk because of this. It's a $90 billion revenue company, I've seen headlines that say $750 million might come off of YouTube's revenue in 2017 because of this. Bigger fraction of YouTube's revenue, but you're not just an investor in YouTube when you buy a stock in Alphabet. So, I'm still confident that they'll figure it out. And between the two of them, Facebook and Google, they're pretty much the only two that are growing in the digital ad space. So, I find it hard to believe that advertisers are going to completely move away from Google. Right now, Facebook is really the only alternative, and that space would become far too crowded too quickly if there was a mass exodus from Google. I'm fairly confident that, because you said 20% of their revenue comes from that search advertising, they're going to figure this out. Hill: It is a small amount of money, and yet, when you look at the headline of Pepsi, Starbucks, General Motors, Wal-Mart have pulled some of their ad spend with YouTube. Those are big-name companies. I think, if you're Facebook, you're not throwing a parade over this, but I think if you're selling video advertising for Facebook, you're on the phone to different media agencies, and I also think television networks. If you're a broadcast network or cable network, to use your phrase, Jason, you're putting the human touch to work, and you're calling these companies and saying, "Listen, don't take a risk with the programmatic algorithm approach to YouTube. You know what you're going to get with our networks, and you're going to get something that associates well with your brand." Muckerman: With some of those companies you mentioned, those are companies that can afford to pull back for a week or two on advertising and make a statement. That's almost advertising in itself. They're still advertising using Google's name, just not using Google's platform. So, I think they'll come back eventually. Probably not too far down the line. Those brands are brands already. You're probably looking at the smaller players, questioning whether or not they can afford to back off of Google's platform a little bit more than Coke or Pepsi. Moser: Yeah, and I think it's also worth noting, for the longest time, YouTube has been synonymous with online video. That's what got this ball rolling. And they've enjoyed such a phenomenal competitive position for so long. What an acquisition Google made for ... what did they buy it for? Hill: $1.6 billion. Muckerman: Pennies on the current dollar. Hill: And the reason I remember it was $1.6 billion is because I was one of the people saying, "Boy, they sure did pay a lot of money for that." Moser: So, I think you fast forward today and you see how this competitive environment has changed, Google and YouTube are not the only players in the online video space. And you see all sorts of companies, from Facebook and Twitter to Verizon and AT&T developing their online video offerings. To your point, I think it's very easy to see these customers pulling back for a week, a month, and saying, "Hey, let's reasses what's going on here." Google and YouTube are too big to say, "We don't want to be a part of your environment." That's just foregoing a tremendous reach that anybody in their right mind would want to be a part of. But, what it could do is, it could result in some pricing competition. It can certainly make Google have to get in there and compete a bit more on pricing, lose a bit, perhaps, of that pricing power, particularly as we ship to mobile, and we know those mobile advertisements are not nearly as lucrative as the desktops were, from a real estate perspective. But, these are smart people running a very, very big company. The solution to this really is as simple as, listen to your customers and give them what they want. So, from that perspective, I don't see any reason why they can't fix it. I guess it's going to be interesting to see how they fix it, and how quickly they go about fixing it, because they don't enjoy that same competitive position that they enjoyed, perhaps, five years ago.

The firm came under fire from the Government last year for not paying its fair share to the exchequer and opposition politicians seized on the latest tax payment as a sign that the US tech giant was still not doing enough. Google insisted it paid "all the taxes due in the UK" but as an international firm it paid the majority of its taxes in its home country. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "This revelation only further proves that Philip Hammond and Theresa May are more interested in cutting Google's taxes, than making sure they are paying their fair share. "It seems that the so called 'successful' tax deal with Google that George Osborne boasted about last year has meant that they are still not paying their fair share under his successor Philip Hammond. "We urgently need clarity on HM Revenue and Customs' relationship with Google and what reassurances have been provided to the company. "It is a national disgrace that by paying just £36 million in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country. And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory Government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year's scandal." Liberal Democrat treasury spokeswoman Baroness Kramer said: "It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes. "Our worst fear is that the Tories would use Brexit to turn the UK into a tax haven sitting off the northern shores of Europe, there is no sign that this isn't where we are headed. "This Government is already struggling with the Brexit squeeze, if they want to stop cutting vital services they need to start picking up what is owed to the British people." Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the influential Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said: "Yet again we see a large corporation paying a rate of tax that belies its significant presence and business transactions in the UK. "This is why the PAC is working internationally to press for greater tax transparency so that we can all see clearly how much tax corporations pay and where. "There is already strong international support and growing collaboration for changing the way tax is reported by multinationals. "This latest tax contribution from Google just underlines why this is so important." The firm revealed it paid £36.4 million in UK corporation tax on pre-tax profits of £148.8 million in the year to June 30 2016. A Google spokesman said: "As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. "We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff." The tech company paid £46.2 million in corporation tax for the previous 18 months to June 30 2015. That covered an extra six months of business before Google moved to a 12-month accounting period the following year.  Google said both administrative costs and turnover for the period decreased as a result of the accounting changes. Revenue dropped £141 million in the year to June 30 2016 to £1 billion, from just under £1.2 billion for the previous 18 months.  The company has faced mounting pressure over its tax affairs amid a backlash against corporate tax avoidance by multi-national companies. Google agreed to a controversial £130 million deal with HM Revenue & Customs in January last year to settle a 10-year tax inquiry into its UK business. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) declined to comment on Google's tax payment, saying it did not discuss identifiable taxpayers.  A spokesman said: "Everyone has to pay the tax due under the law and we do not settle for less. "Our most recent figures show that HMRC brought in a record £26 billion in extra tax for our public services, with £7.3 billion of that total coming from the 2,100 largest and most complex businesses in the UK."   31 March 2017 10:00PM View comments Most Commented Win a £1,000 garden makeover with Quattro Products and the News & Star 18 Keith Curle: Remaining games will show who is fit to stay at Carlisle Utd 5 Shaun Miller sent off as Carlisle Utd flop at home to Crewe 4 Work set to start on controversial castle crossing in Carlisle 4 'Kind, passionate & a hunger for life' - tributes to Carlisle biker killed in crash 3 Most Read One dead and two hurt following crash near Carlisle Strictly Come Dancing star Anton Du Beke announces birth of twins Tributes after sudden death of young Cumbrian rugby player Congealed food, unwashed residents, staff in tears - shock Carlisle home report 'Kind, passionate & a hunger for life' - tributes to Carlisle biker killed in crash More news   Roxie Fawn The new rules make it illegal for under-18s to buy tobacco and nicotine vapour products, known as NVPs or e-cigarettes E-cigarette restrictions coming into force in Scotland The body was reportedly found by a dog walker on Murlough beach in Newcastle, Co Down Probe as man's body found on beach A girl's mother at the centre of a family court dispute made a number of complaints at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London Judge 'irritated' during 'tortuous' dispute over two-year-old girl, hearing told The Prince of Wales meets religious leaders during a walking tour of the Old Town in Bucharest Charles to honour First World War dead during Italy visit Quick searches Carlisle Airport Carlisle United Court cases Cumberland Infirmary Sellafield West Cumberland Hospital Featured articles   New £1 coin Photo: Martin Keene/PA Wire There's a new quid on the block: everything you need to know about the new £1 coin Don't get caught out with new mobile phone laws: find out the dos and don'ts JOBS PROPERTY MOTORS LOCAL BUSINESSES READER TRAVEL BUY PHOTOS PLACE AN AD DATING Contact Us News & Star Newspaper House, Dalston Road Carlisle, Cumbria CA2 5UA 01228 612600 Contact us online here Facebook Twitter YouTube Sitemap Home | News | Carlisle Utd | Sport | Motors | Property | Jobs | Contact Us | Lifestyle | Family Notices | Buy photos | Place an ad | Buy and Sell | Readers Travel | Subscriptions | Business Directory | Dating | Pets in Cumbria Services Subscriptions | Jobs | Property | Motors | Travel | Dating | Family Notices | Pets CN Group News & Star | Cumberland News | Times & Star | Whitehaven News | Hexham Courant | NW Evening Mail | Eskdale & Liddesdale Advertiser | Cumbria Life | Carlisle Living | Dumfries and Galloway Life | in-cumbria | The Bay | Lakeland Radio | Cumbria Live | Choose Cumbria | CN-Jobs | clickin2 | Business directory | Reader holidays | CN Group | Privacy policy © 2017 CN Group back to top

Get loaded up on content with these value for money media streamers By Chris Martin | 31 Mar 17 Specifications Media streamer Dual-core processor 1GB RAM 8GB storage dual-band Wi-Fi with MIMO See full specs Price when reviewed £35 Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Price comparision from , and manufacturers Amazon Fire TV Stick vs Chromecast 2 vs Roku Streaming Stick Media streamers are all the rage and we can see why, they are a great way to easily and cheaply get access to a wealth of online content including movies and TV shows. The problem is the amount of choice so we've compared three of the best streaming sticks you can buy - The Amazon Fire TV Stick, Google Chromecast 2 and Roku Streaming Stick. See: Best media streamers 2016. Bear in mind that we're looking at streaming sticks here - which are a bit like HDMI media versions of USB sticks - so there are also set-top box style options out there. These HDMI-dongles, if you like, offer great value for money and often don't come with too many sacrifices compared to boxes. Please also not that we're looking at the second-generation Chromecast from 2015 (aka the Chromecast 2), not the newer models such as the 4K-enabled Chromecast Ultra. Prices Streaming sticks are more affordable than a more traditional media set-top box like the Apple TV, Google Nexus Player and the Roku 3.  Amazon's Fire TV Stick is £34 in the UK which isn't bad at all and the second generation of the Chromecast remains at a reasonable £30. The Roku Streaming Stick is the most expensive but is hardly out of reach at £39. See below for a price comparison chart and remember that we're talking about RRP in general but all of these are on offer sometimes so we've included those prices, but they might not always be available.   Amazon Fire TV Stick Google Chromecast Roku Streaming Stick Price (RRP) £34 £30 £39 Offer price £24 £20 £29 Specs and features On the whole, these streaming sticks are very similar. They all plug straight into your TV via a spare HDMI port (requiring Micro-USB power) and connect to your internet over Wi-Fi in order to stream the content. While, their specs are closely matched, there are some differences to point out including which services are supported and what you get in the box. See Apple TV vs Chromecast review. Remotes and apps It's natural to use a physical controller with your TV or whatever is plugged into it, and the Amazon Fire TV Stick and Roku Streaming Stick both come with one. Amazon also sells an optional voice control remote and gaming controller, too. On the other hand, the Chromecast is controlled via a smartphone or tablet app. You search for the content you want to view, then 'cast' it to the Chromecast to be displayed on the big screen. This isn't exclusive to the Chromecast though, as you can still send content to the Streaming Stick with the same method for providers like Netflix and YouTube. Amazon has a Fire TV Remote app with which you can voice search for content. Gaming As we just mentioned, there's an optional game pad for the Fire TV Stick and it supports games like Minecraft Pocket Edition, Asphalt 8, Riptide and more. Amazon says there are more than 400 available making it the best for gaming. The Roku Streaming Stick has around 100 games available but the controller doesn't support motion control like the Roku 3. The Chromecast only has a handful of pretty basic games which you can play. Specs As we've mentioned, the specs of these three streaming sticks is similar. However, the newer Fire TV Stick is superior with a dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. It also has dual-band Wi-Fi with dual-antenna (MIMO) which is also found on the Roku Streaming Stick. The Chromecast 2 also has a dual-core processor and 11.ac dual-band Wi-Fi which is the main upgrade from the original. It's the Roku which has single-band Wi-Fi although we've not had any issues in this area. These devices are mostly for streaming content from the internet so we wouldn't worry about storage and we've not seen any performance issues with the Chromecast or Roku Streaming Stick. What is more important is which services you can access on them (see below). It's worth noting that depending the design of your TV, you might not be able to insert a streaming stick and will require an HDMI extension cable. Amazon and Google include one in the box but Roku doesn't. Services All the above specs and features are great but mean nothing if you can't watch some great content on your TV. With the right device, you can mirror your smartphone or tablet's screen on the TV via the streaming stick – but the big name services are more important. See also: Netflix vs Amazon Prime Instant Video. If you're a big Amazon Prime Instant Video user then the Fire TV Stick is the device for you as it's not available on rivals. It also supports Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Demand 5, All 4, ITV Player, Vimeo, Sky News, Curzon, Muzu.TV, BBC News, Amazon Music, DailyMotion, Plex, Red Bull TV, BBC Sport, Viewster, STV Player, Ministry of Sound Radio and YouTube. Note the lack of Sky Now TV and Sky Store. See the entire list. The Roku Streaming Stick also supports many of the above with key names including BBC iPlayer, all 4, Demand 5, ITV Player, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Sky Now TV, Sky Store, Plex, Sky News, Vevo, Spotify, Flixster and Rdio. See all the Roku apps. One of the Chromecast's big selling points was access to the Google Play store (movies and music) but Roku added this as a channel. It is the only one with Blinkbox (now TalkTalk TV) and Wuaki.tv, though. The device also supports, Netflix, BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, BT Sport, YouTube, Sky Now TV, Vevo, Rdio, and Deezer. It now has All 4 but lacks the Sky Store and Demand 5. It's worth noting that it can mirror content from the Chrome web browser from a PC or laptop on the same network. Browse Chromecast supported apps. See below for a table of the big name players.   Amazon Fire TV Stick Google Chromecast Roku Streaming Stick Netflix Yes Yes Yes Amazon Instant Video Yes   Yes Google Play Movies & TV   Yes  Yes BBC iPlayer Yes Yes Yes ITV Hub Yes Yes Yes All 4 Yes Yes Yes My 5 Yes Yes Yes YouTube Yes Yes Yes Sky Now TV     Yes Sky Store     Yes Plex Yes Yes Yes Wuaki.tv   Yes   TalkTalk TV   Yes   Flixster Yes   Yes Amazon Music Yes     Google Play Music   Yes   Spotify Yes Yes Yes Rdio   Yes Yes Total 11 13 14 Amazon Fire TV Stick: Specs Media streamer Dual-core processor 1GB RAM 8GB storage dual-band Wi-Fi with MIMO Remote included HDMI extender included Support for Dolby Digital Plus, 5.1 surround sound and passthrough for 7.1 Output: 720p or 1080p up to 60fps 84.9 x 25.0 x 11.5 mm 25g Media streamer Dual-core processor 1GB RAM 8GB storage dual-band Wi-Fi with MIMO Remote included HDMI extender included Support for Dolby Digital Plus, 5.1 surround sound and passthrough for 7.1 Output: 720p or 1080p up to 60fps 84.9 x 25.0 x 11.5 mm 25g OUR VERDICT All three of these media streaming sticks makes for a good purchase so it really depends what you want. However, objectively, the Roku Streaming Stick stands out slightly with its remote control and superior list of available content services.

[Update: Logitech, August, Rachio, more] Google Assistant can now control LIFX, TP-Link, Vivint, and Best Buy Insignia devices Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 2:30am PDTMar 29, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares108 Google News Update 1: 2017/03/29 2:47am PDT Logitech, August Home, and Rachio have all announced that they're adding Google Assistant support for the Harmony hubs and remotes, Smart Lock, and Smart Sprinkler Controller, respectively. However, A smart home hub, like the Google Home, is only useful if it can actually control your smart home stuff. The Google Home only shipped with a handful of supported devices and services, but over the past few months, that has expanded a great deal. In addition to the Wink devices we covered earlier, Google Assistant (and thus, the Google Home) now works with LIFX, TP-Link, Vivint, and Best Buy Insignia smart home products. Let's start with Best Buy Insignia, which is the company's own line of tech products. You're probably familiar with the Insignia TVs or tablets, but only the Insignia Wi-Fi smart plug is compatible (for now). Just like similar products from TP-Link and WeMo, this is pretty much just an outlet you can turn on or off remotely. LIFX primarily sells smart light bulbs, similar to Phillips Hue. In addition to the usual multi-colored bulbs, they have a few unique options as well, like an infrared bulb to help home security cameras. You could already get LIFX to work with your Google Home through the Samsung SmartThings Hub, but official support is always great to have. Next up is Vivint, which is more focused on security. Vivint produces several connected security devices (cameras, locks, etc), which all connect to a central control panel. Now that control panel can connect to Google Assistant, giving you easy access to your whole security system. Finally we come to TP-Link - no, you can't control your router with voice commands. The company's range of light bulbs is supported, which don't actually need any connected hub to work (just a standard 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection). TP-Link also sells several Wi-Fi smart plugs. As always, you can connect these devices to Assistant through the Google Home app. If you already have one of these products, a firmware update or something similar may be required for full compatibility. Update 1: 2017/03/29 2:47am PDT Logitech, August Home, and Rachio have all announced that they're adding Google Assistant support for the Harmony hubs and remotes, Smart Lock, and Smart Sprinkler Controller, respectively. However, it seems that August Home and Rachio will only work with Assistant on Google Home, not the one on your phone. Sigh. It might be the same for Logitech. Also supposedly going live are First Alert (which was promised last year along with Wink and LiFX), Frigidaire, Geeni, and Anova. I'm not sure if any/all of these are live yet because I can't see them in Assistant on my phone. They might be limited to Google Home, but they might also be in the list of third-party services instead of the list of products you can easily integrate with Assistant. Let us know if you see them and if they're working for you.

Michael Lavi I don't think August is live yet. Don't see any option to add August in the Google Assistant settings not do I see Google Assistant in the august access settings... WretchedGenius It's not under Home Control, it's under Services. Michael Lavi Thanks. Got it linked now, but that means I can't use Assistant on my phone to control August. Why? This is ridiculous. WretchedGenius I'm just guessing, but maybe a security precaution so you can't accidentally lock/unlock your door when not on the property? I've accidentally controlled some of my smart home devices remotely while explaining to someone how it works. Rita El Khoury You're right. Both announced it, but Corbin must have missed the PRs in our inbox' deluge of emails. I'm updating the post to reflect that. Francois Roy Holy crap the TP-LINK smartplugs are so badly engineered I just can't believe they made it past the drawing board. Oo When you are outdesigned by friggin Insignia, you know it's BAD.. ZettabyteGamer The TP-LINK Mini works really well, whats so bad with it. They also have the best Android app out of any of the smart-switch makers, which is exactly why I chose tp link. Francois Roy Can't you see the HS100/110 models blocks EVERY other outlet around it? Up/down/left/right. Way to go, geniuses. What's more, it is BOUND to be used on the upper most outlet. If you have something else as badly designed to plug at the same place (or let's be crazy: a second unit), you're screwed. As for the mini, the bloody plug is centered! That will inevitably block outlets on many types of powerbars. Now look at the Insignia model and you will NEVER find a scenario/powerbar model where you are forced to block another outlet. And that, my friend, is what I call a good design. Max Müller f*ck this shit and open the API for everyone! Gerardo Sarabia LIFX is definitely a good addition. ZettabyteGamer It's realllllllyyyyy broken, not even usable. Gerardo Sarabia Still broken? It is working fine for me. ZettabyteGamer It seems to be mostly working now, still has some hiccups every now and then. Ahmad El-Ibrahim Can't wait until the Vivint gets implemented, their blog post stated in April. wcjeep Alexa has worked with TP Link for awhile now. Alexa also works with Honeywell Thermostat. Surprised Google is still playing catch up. Greg Macek Why is it a surprise? Google Home came out less than a year ago and Alexa has been out for 2+ years? Did anyone realistically expect developers to port everything over to GH from Alexa that fast? YaKillaCJ For real. This reminds me of the whole iOS is better and have more/better Apps than Android. Old underdog Android is now outselling iOS 9:1. wcjeep With Google money I thought Google Home would come out of the gate swinging. I went with Alexa because it's cheap ($50), better form factor and works with more peripherals. If Google Home can equal Alexa than I'd consider switching. Google has way better search than Alexa. I already have a phone and tablet. Adam Margeson Kind of, yeah. Let's be real - it's not like any of them really care about privacy or security in the first place, so it should be pretty straight forward to get it up and running. Gerardo Sarabia Alexa launched first, why are you surprised? ZettabyteGamer LIFX is buggy as fuck, If I tell it to change my lights to any color the lights will blink on and off for 20ish seconds, and sometimes stay off. Gerardo Sarabia Working fine for me, at least for now. Moosa Mahsoom I still haven't got Google Assitant on my Moto G4 plus running nougat. any idea why? Jennifercalvarez Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Morten Ulv search language set to US English? Or was it voice language. Or phone language. Can't remember. But a Google search will tell you. Hrithik Oswal Search on YouTube for it Morten Ulv Harmony support also, thats nice. Though since I already set Harmony up with IFTTT, where I just say "turn on the shield", with this I have to say, "ask harmony to turn on the shield". Are there any benefit to this, other than not having to create the actions myself? SyCoREAPER I was going to comment on Harmony, mainly my disappointment. Harmony was the smartest product I had but as of late they don't seem to be keeping up in the home automation arena. Morten Ulv Their software sucks, but once it's set up I think it does the job well. After all, everything is handled through Google Assistant, so I don't really need Harmony to do anything more. Were you thinking more in lines of expanding their support to more type of devices? I'm probably going to get a SmartThings box next. At least that's likely to continue to gets tons of support. SyCoREAPER Well I have the Harmony Hub and the Harmony Total Home (or whatever it's called) to control smart devices like smart plugs, lamps, thermostats, etc. I personally have the opposite view though in regards to their software. It was terrible but is actually quite user friendly and super customizable as well. Detonation Looks like Assistant can do more than just start/end activities now, like pause and change channel/volume. I'll still be sticking with my IFTTT commands for activities though. "Ok Google, Xbox" is a lot easier than "Ok Google, ask harmony to turn on the Xbox" Morten Ulv Ah, that's cool. I'll probably be using both as well. jaylanPHNX This is something I've been waiting for. Starting/stopping my activities through IFTTT is great, but being able to pause Netflix on my tv (or Hulu on my Xbox), or mute the volume on my receiver with my voice will be super useful. I'm often in the kitchen while leaving the remote in the living room or vice versa. jaylanPHNX Has anyone actually gotten this to work? I linked my account, but when I ask Google to ask Harmony to do something, it just tells me it can't send messages yet. WTF?! Morten Ulv I couldn't get it to find my harmony hub. Do I need Google Home for this? Perhaps I need to give the hub a good old reboot... Guest Logitech, August Home, and Rachio are all live and are available through the services section. Itchy_Robot Does this mean we can used them without the Google Home hardware? ddevito People are still using Google Home? YaKillaCJ Yes and happily. Why not? Prezes Dyrektor I'm confused about assistant. Is it gonna be available on all nougat devices, including LOS? And why the differentiation between google home and non home devices? Which one is which and which does it work with? SMH I have logitech harmony setup, I wanna start using voice commands ASAP (without the hassle of IFTTT) YaKillaCJ Well essentially Home and Screen Devices (non-home) have different abilities. Mainly having a screen allows for more options in general on the phone. The benefit of the Home is input distance, input through ambient noise, loud response and always on (not draining battery). But your right to get confused because Google has it backwards in many ways. The assistant on your phone should function better but at times it doesn't. Gerardo Sarabia There's no reason for Assistant being different on your phone and in Home, I mean, no reason apart from Google's stupidity. Honestly this just makes things confusing, but this is classic Google. Larry Gleaner All these new features, and yet it still can't play songs from my library. Jeez. Itchy_Robot Agreed, I really do not understand why we can not stream our music library that is housed on Google Music servers. Larry Gleaner I called support about this, and they told me that this feature is under development. They would not give me a status or an ETA. Seems very odd to me, as this is the primary reason for buying this device! Amazon Echo does this without issue for songs in your Amazon library. Chris Can someone explain what it can do for First Alert smoke alarms? I have an old model that are hardwired with battery backup. I've seen some new wifi version at Lowes which I assume is what Google Home would work with. What exactly do they do and will Home be able to do with them? WretchedGenius Haven't seen FirstAlert go live on GA yet, but my guess is that you will be able to check battery level (which obviously wouldn't be a factor in a wired unit like yours) and probably verbally silence the alarm if it goes off (useful in the kitchen). Matej Ilic Everything but Chromecast and Chromecast audio, Google's own products. (I know Google Home supports it) WretchedGenius August is indeed under Services, and not Home Control. I was able to set mine up in under 30 seconds, and it works identically to their existing Alexa skill. You can have it list your devices, check the status of a lock, or lock a door. Like the Alexa skill, you cannot unlock a door via voice (which makes sense, since you wouldn't want anyone within shouting distance to be able to unlock your door). jamez243 Actually a little disappointed Logitech Harmony as a service instead of device. "Hey Google, ask Harmony" that's already a mouthful. Why not​ just "hey Google tune the TV to ESPN" instead of "hey Google ask Harmony to tune the TV to ESPN" ugh giant22000 You can set up custom commands via IFTTT. Itchy_Robot Why would Logitech, August Home and Rachio support assistant only through Google Home, and not assistant on the phone? My WeMo wifi outlet works with only my Nexus 5X phone with Assistant (no Home), which is great. theSuperStar Harmony service, it works and much easier than Auto Voice setup. just_a_lemming Not having Home available in Australia makes me sad :( Follow Android Police 1.51M 464k 141k 102k Latest Deals 2 Luma 2-pack is $179 ($71 off) on The Home Depot for today only 2017/03/31 4:15pm PDTMar 31, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get a Plugable USB-C meter for just $17.95 ($17 off) on Amazon 2017/03/31 10:56am PDTMar 31, 2017 44 [Deal Alert] Get a black unlocked Galaxy S7 for $400 ($176 off) 2017/03/31 6:32am PDTMar 31, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Get the Ecobee3 smart thermostat for $199 on Amazon ($50 off) 2017/03/30 12:49pm PDTMar 30, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Here are some free and discounted apps from the last few days 2017/03/30 7:26am PDTMar 30, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Google Beats Apple As Most Valuable Brand In The United States Posted: Mar 31 2017, 9:57am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, Updated: Mar 31 2017, 10:47am CDT, in News | Latest Science News   Google leaves Apple Behind in being Best Brand in the United States   It seems that Google has left Apple far behind in the popularity stakes. It has snatched victory from the jaws of defeat by being the best brand in the United States. According to a novel ranking system, Google has achieved the rare feat of being the best brand in all of America. This grand-daddy of search engines beat several other brands to become the top cat. Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway! Such brands which were left biting the dust include Apple and Amazon. Google delivered far more bang for the buck than these other brands. This was tabulated by a firm named Brand Finance.   Google happens to be worth its weight in gold. It has assets amounting to $109 billion which is indeed a whopping sum of cold hard cash. This company has become an ever-present reality in today’s computerized society. The very word “Google” is linked with search engine basics. It has become a virtual household word and is on everyone’s lips from the four year old child to the eighty year old grandparent. Google’s advertising branch rakes in some very lucrative profits each year.  Apple which had held the top position since the past half a decade or so, took a dive and is now worth $107 billion. So it is two billion dollars behind Google in the race for the information technology bonanza that we find ourselves in today. Last year, Apple was worth $146 billion. However, it has let its reputation slip and so is now behind Google on the road to progress. Apple’s recent blunders concerning the exploitation of its clientele led to the dismal result. Rather than live up to the reputation of its genius founder, the late and great Steve Jobs, Apple has only managed to fine-tune its erstwhile products a little in recent times. This left a bitter aftertaste among its main customers who thus decided to pursue fresher pastures.    Amazon meanwhile has the third position after Google and Apple. Its net value stands at $106 billion, according to Fortune.com. It has made a quantum leap of 53% over its profitability last year. Next year, Amazon may well overtake Apple to become the #2 brand in America. The top 500 brands in the US are worth a total amount in cash that clocks in at $3 trillion. This represents an overall increase since last year by 11%. Some of the other conglomerates that count in the economic pie besides Google, Apple and Amazon are: AT&T, Microsoft, Verizon, Walmart, Facebook, Wells Fargo and, last but not least, that symbol of fast food with its Golden Arches, McDonald’s.   This story may contain affiliate links.

Then it became a quirky research project undertaken by a handful of the nerdiest engineers in the robotics industry. Now self-driving cars are on the brink of transforming transportation. The Bay Area industry creating the technology for autonomous vehicles has morphed from a collaborative space of free-flowing ideas into a high-speed road race where the winners will seize a market expected to reach $77 billion by 2035, and the losers will be left in the dust. “The money involved — the money expended in these research efforts and the money expected if they’re successful — has just ballooned and become so much more concrete and attainable,” said Bryant Walker Smith, a scholar with Stanford Law School who specializes in self-driving car law. Major players — Google’s Waymo, Tesla and Uber — are fighting to set the industry standard for consumer-ready autonomous vehicles. Each has much at stake — for Uber, autonomous vehicles could be the ride-hailing startup’s best shot at profitability. But the road ahead is marred by potholes and speed bumps. The intense competition already has spawned at least two significant lawsuits. Coveted engineers working on autonomous cars are regularly switching companies. And a new class of scrappy startups creating self-driving software has emerged, poised to take market share from the established giants. Meanwhile, the major automakers, such as GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler, are staking out their claims to the industry by investing in and partnering with the key tech players. It’s too soon to tell what these marriages will yield, but several teams appear to be eyeing ride-hailing networks that could pose an added threat to Uber and Lyft. Nowhere is the tension better illustrated than in the contentious court battle between Google’s Waymo and Uber. Waymo says its former engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded more than 14,000 confidential company files before leaving to found his own autonomous vehicle startup. The documents allegedly included designs used in Waymo’s LiDAR sensor — one of the key technology components that lets self-driving cars “see” the road. Levandowski founded Otto, an autonomous trucking startup later acquired by Uber. Now Waymo says Uber is employing trade secrets to replicate Waymo’s LiDAR sensors, and has asked a federal judge in San Francisco to prohibit Uber from using that technology — an order that could potentially devastate Uber’s self-driving car program. A hearing is set for the first week of May, and Uber is scheduled to respond to Waymo’s allegations next Friday.  Trade secret fights are common in Silicon Valley, but one thing that makes this one unique is Google’s involvement, which highlights the priority it is placing on its self-driving car program. “Google doesn’t sue people — period,” said Eric Goldman, director of Santa Clara Law’s High Tech Law Institute. “It’s very exceptional to find Google as a plaintiff.” The self-driving car industry was once a close-knit community, Stanford’s Smith said, but the Waymo lawsuit illustrates how far it’s come since those early days. “A lot of people were doing a lot of the same things at the same time — working at a university, consulting with a company and starting their own startup,” he said. “Researchers were pretty freely sharing information.” Tesla filed a similar lawsuit against a former employee in January. The suit accuses former Autopilot program manager Sterling Anderson of nabbing Tesla’s confidential information and trying to recruit at least a dozen of the company’s engineers before leaving to found a competing startup. Anderson and Chris Urmson, the former chief technology officer of Google’s self-driving car program, recently launched self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation. “Tesla understands that some employees may decide to pursue other opportunities or even to create a startup of their own, and Tesla is typically supportive of their personal ambitions and respectful of their decisions,” the company’s lawyers wrote. “However, Tesla cannot sit idly by when an employee like Anderson abuses his position of trust.” A lawyer for Aurora did not respond to a request for comment. Tesla, which says two of its engineers ended up following Anderson to Aurora, isn’t the only company struggling to retain its top talent. A wave of nearly 20 people left Uber’s Pittsburgh-based, self-driving car program in November and December, said a person familiar with the matter, with many of them joining Argo AI — a competing startup founded by an ex-Uber engineer. And last year, two of Google’s top self-driving car executives left to start self-driving car startup Nuro.ai. Reading this on your phone?

Seeing those key people depart is especially painful in the self-driving car space, experts say, where there already is a shortage of talent because of the nascent state of the technology. “Finding and recruiting the top talent is really the name of the game,” said Karl Iagnemma, co-founder and CEO of nuTonomy, a Massachusetts-based startup working on software for self-driving cars. “It’s intense competition to get those people.” Data also is a priority — companies must collect hours of driving data to teach their software to navigate the road. Google got an early start — the company began testing self-driving Prius cars in 2009, and its spinoff Waymo now has about 60 cars collecting data. Uber gathers information in a similar way, operating dozens of self-driving cars in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Tempe, Arizona. Tesla is mining data from the thousands of customers driving with its cars’ Autopilot feature. Some smaller startups are taking a different approach. Palo Alto-based Nauto charges $400 for kits that let taxi drivers, fleet operators and Uber and Lyft drivers retrofit their cars with cameras that give alerts when a driver is doing something unsafe like tailgating. Those sensors funnel driving data back to the company, which is working on fully autonomous software. Apple, meanwhile, reportedly is working on a secretive self-driving car initiative called Project Titan, though details remain scant. So does information on how some of the industry’s main players plan to profit from their self-driving technology. But as hints of future business plans emerge, there are signs of overlap that could add to the competition. Uber is betting its future on autonomous vehicles that can someday replace human drivers in its ride-hailing network. Tesla has expressed interest in creating its own ride-hailing network, and Waymo is rumored to be eyeing similar plans. When it comes to the actual technology behind their cars, the companies are even more tight-lipped. One key feature most autonomous vehicles share is LiDAR — sensors that use lasers to create a 3D image of the car’s surroundings. That’s the technology at the heart of the Waymo v. Uber lawsuit. Waymo says it invested tens of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of engineering hours to build its own sensors, which would cost up to $60,000 off the shelf, only to have Uber copy that work. Trade secrets related to that technology are so precious to Waymo that when the court fight began, Waymo refused even to tell Uber which secrets it was accusing its rival of misappropriating. However the case plays out, it could have major repercussions for the industry. “If Google were to get everything that it is seeking,” Smith said, “it could stop Uber’s self-driving car program.” Self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan equipped with self-driving technology from Google spin-off Waymo.

Toronto’s New AI Hub Will Let Scientists Do Whatever the Hell They Want Can the Vector Institute compete with Silicon Valley? Artificial intelligence as we know it was largely developed in Canada, but Silicon Valley is reaping the rewards. Now, the Canadian government is placing its faith in a new Toronto-based AI research initiative, the Vector Institute, to bring some of that expertise—and the attendant profits—home. The full-court press of media events that took place during Vector's launch on Thursday made it clear that hopes are high. The morning saw Geoffrey Hinton, a Canadian computer scientist known as the "godfather of deep learning," give a presentation on the technology to journalists at Google's Toronto headquarters. In the afternoon, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau highlighted the government's AI funding in a press conference. That evening, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, Finance Minister Charles Sousa, and Hinton gathered in downtown Toronto's MaRS building to announce the Vector launch. It really seems like everyone wants Vector to be a huge deal. But despite $150 million in funding from the provincial and federal governments, as well as a smattering of companies including Google, the Vector Institute is up against stiff competition in Silicon Valley, the UK, and around the world. What's Vector's angle? "If someone's got a strong intuition that something's going to pay off in the future—we want research like that" "We can offer people the chance to do any mix of basic research and applications that they want, and they're going to have lots of data, particularly from hospitals," said Hinton in an interview. Hinton will be living in Toronto permanently to act as a research adviser for Vector, essentially giving suggestions on where to spend its money. It's unclear what sorts of data Vector will be taking from hospitals, but Toronto is also a major hub for biomedical and stem cell research. Hinton noted that AI could soon be a popular tool for medical imaging: for example, reading an X-ray for anomalies. According to Hinton, Vector's philosophy will be to let researchers do whatever they want with as few strings attached as possible, whether that's basic research that may take years to see the light of day, or commercial services. And if anyone knows the value of basic research without an immediate payoff, it's Hinton. "I had an idea about five years ago that I've been working on ever since, and it still doesn't work very well," Hinton said. "Google has been very good about giving me lots of time to work on this even though it hasn't worked out yet."

The vision for Vector seems like a long-term one. During his speech at the launch, Meric Gertler, president of the University of Toronto (which is affiliated with Vector), compared the Institute to how the US government funded Arpanet in the 1970s, which eventually became the internet. This is just as well, because the history so far of AI is also one of delayed satisfaction. Just one example is the neural network fine-tuning technique of backpropagation, which was invented in the 1980s but only became really useful recently. Computers just weren't powerful enough back then. Despite all this fanfare, there are potential pitfalls, like focusing less on research and more on pumping out degrees. One of Vector's selling points, highlighted by chair of the Vector board and former bank CEO Ed Clark during his speech at the opening, will be "[training] more Masters and PhDs in the field of deep learning than any other institution in the world." Still, pushing the envelope of basic research seems to be exactly what Vector can do best. Hinton said that we shouldn't be satisfied to tinker endlessly with the tools he invented—we should be looking for new and better ones. "I happen to know," he said, "that the neural networks we have today are just something people made up when they came to work."

The American internet giant, which has faced years of criticism over how much it pays to the Exchequer, revealed the payment in accounts published on Friday afternoon. It said it paid “all the taxes due in the UK”. Account for Google UK Limited revealed profits of £148.8m in the year to June 30, 2016, with revenues reaching £1bn. At the 20pc corporation tax rate, this generated a bill of £29.8m, while deferred taxes from previous years and other adjustments brought the total bill up to £36.4m. As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home countryGoogle "As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK,” a Google spokesman said. “We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff.” Buried in the accounts is a "corporation tax receivable", a £31.4m payment from HMRC which acts as a refund, for instance if the firm has over-paid on pre-paid, estimated corporation tax bills. In January last year, Google agreed a deal with HMRC that saw it pay £130m in taxes dating back to 2005. It came after the tax office had spent years investigating large multinational corporations. Google had previously registered much of its UK sales in Ireland, reducing its profits and taxes in Britain. Under the deal agreed last year, Google UK now registers sales from British advertisers. HMRC agreed a deal with Google last year Credit: Alamy The change came after the Treasury introduced a so-called “Google tax” that blocks companies from shifting profits overseas. Facebook has also pledged to pay more in UK tax by booking sales in Britain, while Snapchat has said it will register non-US advertising revenue to its UK subsidiary. Google UK’s annual profits of £148.8m and revenue of £1bn compared to £110.8m and £1.2bn in the 18 months to June 30, 2015, a longer accounting period due to a change in its financial year. Staff in the UK rose by 614 to 2,943. Google recently announced that it plans to hire thousands of new staff at its UK headquarters in King’s Cross, in what was seen as a vote of confidence in the UK after the Brexit vote.

(Source: Waymo) By Marisa Kendall | mkendall@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 31, 2017 at 7:00 am | UPDATED: March 31, 2017 at 5:51 pm Related Articles Self-driving Ubers back in action in SF following Arizona crash Google eyes method to reduce injuries to pedestrians, cyclists when self-driving cars hit them Tesla brings Autopilot hardware to all vehicles First, it was just a dream. Then it became a quirky research project undertaken by a handful of the nerdiest engineers in the robotics industry. Now self-driving cars are on the brink of transforming transportation. The Bay Area industry creating the technology for autonomous vehicles has morphed from a collaborative space of free-flowing ideas into a high-speed road race where the winners will seize a market expected to reach $77 billion by 2035, and the losers will be left in the dust. “The money involved — the money expended in these research efforts and the money expected if they’re successful — has just ballooned and become so much more concrete and attainable,” said Bryant Walker Smith, a scholar with Stanford Law School who specializes in self-driving car law. Major players — Google’s Waymo, Tesla and Uber — are fighting to set the industry standard for consumer-ready autonomous vehicles. Each has much at stake — for Uber, autonomous vehicles could be the ride-hailing startup’s best shot at profitability. But the road ahead is marred by potholes and speed bumps. The intense competition already has spawned at least two significant lawsuits. Coveted engineers working on autonomous cars are regularly switching companies. And a new class of scrappy startups creating self-driving software has emerged, poised to take market share from the established giants. Meanwhile, the major automakers, such as GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler, are staking out their claims to the industry by investing in and partnering with the key tech players. It’s too soon to tell what these marriages will yield, but several teams appear to be eyeing ride-hailing networks that could pose an added threat to Uber and Lyft. Nowhere is the tension better illustrated than in the contentious court battle between Google’s Waymo and Uber. Waymo says its former engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded more than 14,000 confidential company files before leaving to found his own autonomous vehicle startup. The documents allegedly included designs used in Waymo’s LiDAR sensor — one of the key technology components that lets self-driving cars “see” the road. Levandowski founded Otto, an autonomous trucking startup later acquired by Uber. Now Waymo says Uber is employing trade secrets to replicate Waymo’s LiDAR sensors, and has asked a federal judge in San Francisco to prohibit Uber from using that technology — an order that could potentially devastate Uber’s self-driving car program. A hearing is set for the first week of May, and Uber is scheduled to respond to Waymo’s allegations next Friday.  Trade secret fights are common in Silicon Valley, but one thing that makes this one unique is Google’s involvement, which highlights the priority it is placing on its self-driving car program. “Google doesn’t sue people — period,” said Eric Goldman, director of Santa Clara Law’s High Tech Law Institute. “It’s very exceptional to find Google as a plaintiff.” The self-driving car industry was once a close-knit community, Stanford’s Smith said, but the Waymo lawsuit illustrates how far it’s come since those early days. “A lot of people were doing a lot of the same things at the same time — working at a university, consulting with a company and starting their own startup,” he said. “Researchers were pretty freely sharing information.” Tesla filed a similar lawsuit against a former employee in January. The suit accuses former Autopilot program manager Sterling Anderson of nabbing Tesla’s confidential information and trying to recruit at least a dozen of the company’s engineers before leaving to found a competing startup. Anderson and Chris Urmson, the former chief technology officer of Google’s self-driving car program, recently launched self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation. “Tesla understands that some employees may decide to pursue other opportunities or even to create a startup of their own, and Tesla is typically supportive of their personal ambitions and respectful of their decisions,” the company’s lawyers wrote. “However, Tesla cannot sit idly by when an employee like Anderson abuses his position of trust.” A lawyer for Aurora did not respond to a request for comment. Tesla, which says two of its engineers ended up following Anderson to Aurora, isn’t the only company struggling to retain its top talent. A wave of nearly 20 people left Uber’s Pittsburgh-based, self-driving car program in November and December, said a person familiar with the matter, with many of them joining Argo AI — a competing startup founded by an ex-Uber engineer. And last year, two of Google’s top self-driving car executives left to start self-driving car startup Nuro.ai. Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date with our free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store or the Google Play store. Seeing those key people depart is especially painful in the self-driving car space, experts say, where there already is a shortage of talent because of the nascent state of the technology. “Finding and recruiting the top talent is really the name of the game,” said Karl Iagnemma, co-founder and CEO of nuTonomy, a Massachusetts-based startup working on software for self-driving cars. “It’s intense competition to get those people.” Data also is a priority — companies must collect hours of driving data to teach their software to navigate the road. Google got an early start — the company began testing self-driving Prius cars in 2009, and its spinoff Waymo now has about 60 cars collecting data. Uber gathers information in a similar way, operating dozens of self-driving cars in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Tempe, Arizona. Tesla is mining data from the thousands of customers driving with its cars’ Autopilot feature. Some smaller startups are taking a different approach. Palo Alto-based Nauto charges $400 for kits that let taxi drivers, fleet operators and Uber and Lyft drivers retrofit their cars with cameras that give alerts when a driver is doing something unsafe like tailgating. Those sensors funnel driving data back to the company, which is working on fully autonomous software. Apple, meanwhile, reportedly is working on a secretive self-driving car initiative called Project Titan, though details remain scant. So does information on how some of the industry’s main players plan to profit from their self-driving technology. But as hints of future business plans emerge, there are signs of overlap that could add to the competition. Uber is betting its future on autonomous vehicles that can someday replace human drivers in its ride-hailing network. Tesla has expressed interest in creating its own ride-hailing network, and Waymo is rumored to be eyeing similar plans. When it comes to the actual technology behind their cars, the companies are even more tight-lipped. One key feature most autonomous vehicles share is LiDAR — sensors that use lasers to create a 3D image of the car’s surroundings. That’s the technology at the heart of the Waymo v. Uber lawsuit. Waymo says it invested tens of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of engineering hours to build its own sensors, which would cost up to $60,000 off the shelf, only to have Uber copy that work. Trade secrets related to that technology are so precious to Waymo that when the court fight began, Waymo refused even to tell Uber which secrets it was accusing its rival of misappropriating. However the case plays out, it could have major repercussions for the industry. “If Google were to get everything that it is seeking,” Smith said, “it could stop Uber’s self-driving car program.” Self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan equipped with self-driving technology from Google spin-off Waymo.

PHOTO: lauragrafie. What happens when users fail to use the proper security settings when they upload files to the cloud? In the case of select Microsoft Office 365 users recently, the inadvertent exposure of private information — everything from password lists and job acceptance letters to investment portfolios, divorce settlement agreements, and credit card statements. Some of the documents in question contained a treasure trove of personally identifiable information, including Social Security and driving license numbers, birthdates, phone numbers, and email and postal addresses. Here's What Happened The issue involved data stores on the Microsoft site Docs.com. A part of Office Online, Docs.com is an internet site for publishing Office documents that anyone can find, browse and share. For a time, Microsoft really provided what it promised — because anyone could actually search through millions of files for sensitive and personal information. Most document and file sharing sites default uploaded content to private. But on Docs.com, users apparently had to opt-in to keep their information private because Microsoft set the default setting on all documents uploaded to the site as "public." That means the information was findable through the site's search engine/ The issue was discovered late last week when users realized a wide array of information from Word documents, Excel workbooks, PowerPoint and Office Mix presentations, OneNote notebooks, PDF files, Sway stories and Minecraft worlds was surprisingly easy to find. Microsoft pulled the search feature from the site, but then restored it after adding some search restrictions. In a statement released to ArsTechnica, Microsoft explained: “Docs.com lets customers showcase and share their documents with the world. As part of our commitment to protect customers, we're taking steps to help those who may have inadvertently published documents with sensitive information. Customers can check and update their settings by logging into their account at www.docs.com. Too Much Information? There is a massive business issue here and not just with Docs.com. Josh Eddy, director of product marketing at security vendor CTERA’s, told CMSWire situations like this underscore the dilemma many businesses now need to address. “Accidental oversharing via Docs.com highlights how many businesses have failed to adopt proper controls and tools to keep private files from leaking. This is just the most recent in a series of major cloud exposures over the past two years, a period that has seen the breach of information about more than 3 billion users from major clouds, including Dropbox, Yahoo, Adobe, Evernote and many others,” he said. “Despite these setbacks, businesses understand they must embrace cloud technology to stay competitive. But enterprise IT needs to recognize that not all clouds provide the same information security, and need to increase the importance and thoroughness of data privacy considerations in their decision making. Only then can they curtail data leaks.” In other information-related news ... Google Removes SMS Service From Hangouts Google is removing its SMS messaging support from Hangouts on Android after May 22. According to an email sent to G Suite administrators and Reddit, the change will prevent anyone using Hangouts as both a Google messaging app and their primary text messaging app from sending SMS texts. “Users will be prompted to choose another default messaging app already installed on their phone. If none exists, they will be directed to the Google Play store to find a new SMS messaging app. Choosing a new messaging app will not impact existing SMS messages. All messages will be accessible in the new messaging app,” the email explained. The change only affects text messaging. Google Voice numbers are still supported. It’s not clear why Mountain View, Calif.-based Google is doing this and it didn’t explain. So let’s speculate. A few weeks ago, Google unveiled new ambitions for Hangouts and announced it wanted to turn it into a better workplace took for communication and collaboration. The Hangouts SMS feature is more customer orientated and doesn’t really fit well with an enterprise application, especially one that potential has access to enterprise documents. The easiest thing to do and the best way of reassuring enterprise admins that content is secure and that nothing will leak through SMS is to simply get rid of it. Further, a consumer-grade SMS service doesn't fit well with the new Hangouts Meet and Hangouts chat for business users Google unveiled at its Cloud Next conference. HelloSign’s New Workflow Offering San Francisco-based HelloSign just released HelloWorks, a digital workflow product. Founded in 2011, HelloSign is the company behind one of the better-known e-signature platforms. By adding digital processes, it advances its goal of transforming paper processes to digital workflows. Until now, digitizing paper processes meant converting the documents to PDFs and then incorporating those into enterprise processes. However, these processes are typically high volume, directly relate to a business’ revenue stream, are highly complex and error-prone. Incomplete business workflows, including those hampered by obsolete PDF technology, can cost businesses between 11 and 25 percent of their revenue annually, HelloSign claims. The HelloWorks solution makes both documents and workflows dynamic. It enables businesses to pull information from PDFs into other systems, applications and databases. It's also responsive, which means it’s easy to fill out the required information on any device. In January, HelloSign released an updated version of its e-signature app, HelloSign for Salesforce on the Salesforce AppExchange. In March it released a suite of features designed to enable more advanced e-signature processes and expand the HelloSign API. Access, DocuSign Partner Livermore, Calif.-based records management specialist Access, now a part of Iron Mountain, announced an integration between FileBRIDGE and DocuSign's Digital Transaction Management (DTM) platform and e-signature service. The integration aims to give users an entire life-cycle, compliance and documents storage offering across the enterprise. San Francisco-based DocuSign offers e-signature capabilities on any device while the Access FileBRIDGE platform automates document-centric business processes and centralizes digital file management for better security, compliance and information governance. Because of the integration, mutual customers will be able to use DocuSign's capabilities with FileBRIDGE to make sure critical business documents are securely managed through their lifecycle from creation of the digital record to its secure storage and access to compliant document elimination. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Is Office 365 Going to Eat Your Lunch?

Galaxy S8 and S8+ hands-on: Betting big on big David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 8:04am PDTMar 29, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares155 Galaxy S8 News Phone Reviews Videos The Galaxy S6 was, by all accounts, a truly transformational moment for Samsung's industrial design. After years of building plastic phones constantly lambasted for their "cheapness," Samsung made radical changes in an attempt to completely redefine its smartphone brand. Those changes were generally well received, but it always felt like they stopped short: the software was still slow, bloated, and the battery life surprisingly poor. With the Note5 and S6 edge+ we saw significant refinement of that reinvention "moment," but not until the S7 and S7 edge did Samsung really build the concept I think they set out to with those first metal and glass sandwiches. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are Samsung's attempt to show us that they can do more than just iterate on that "Eureka" moment they had in 2015, even if those iterations have generally been quite good. And after the Note7 disaster last year, they really need to make good on that promise. After spending some time with the phones last week, I'm still on the fence as to whether Samsung has truly succeeded - but I think the pieces for success are there. Even if I don't think they're all terribly obvious, and even if the phones don't take any real big risks. The hardware Take what you loved about the Galaxy S7 edge and Note7, then just imagine it all being better. More refined, more coherent, more polished. As to that final point: literally. The Galaxy S8 siblings now feature polished aluminum mid-frames, as opposed to the matte anodized finish of years past. In particular - at least in my opinion - this looks good on the Midnight Black version of the phone, which features a shiny black mid-frame to match. The whole phone visually sort of looks like a deep black stone - it's a very interesting and striking effect Samsung has achieved here. As you'd expect of Samsung, the attention to detail is impeccable. The glass meets the aluminum in a very natural, near-seamless way, and the various body colors all have a distinct character. The front of the phones, however, do not: unlike years past, all colors of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will feature black surrounds on the display side of the phone, to accentuate Samsung's "infinity display" and its minimal bezel. I absolutely agree with this design decision, because it brings the canvas - the screen - out as the sole focal point of the front of the device. You're drawn to the screen, and everything surrounding it just sort of falls away. Samsung has been paying attention to the little stuff, too. Everything from the design of the camera module (it now has more of a stylized "lens" effect) to the smooth USB-C cutout seems carefully considered and manufactured with precision. The phones scream quality, and I am continually impressed by Samsung's ability to iterate in this area. Samsung clearly spends a lot of time and energy on its design and manufacturing processes, and it shows. Perhaps most notably, these phones mark the end of one of the last vestigial elements of the Galaxy brand: capacitive navigation keys and the physical home button. It really makes the S8 and S8+ the cleanest-looking handsets Samsung's ever produced. Above the display sit the standard array of sensors, including a new 8MP front-facing camera with software-simulated autofocus (we'll see how that goes) and the iris scanner array. Out back, Samsung says the 12MP rear camera is basically unchanged physically from last year's, with most optimizations happening on the photo processing side. I'm certainly curious to see how photos compare to last year's phones, then. You still get IP68 waterproofing, and 64GB of storage is now standard (with microSD expansion available). Samsung has retained the headphone jack, but made the switch to USB-C it began with the Note7 last year. Wireless charging is intact, too. As to the deceptively giant displays, at 5.8 and 6.2", respectively, the phones are considerably taller this year. But they're also narrowed, meaning they're easier to get a grip on, and they really aren't especially heavy or unwieldy. Ceding so much of what was previously bezel space to the expanded display seems an obvious choice in retrospect, but to me it definitely necessitated the end of the capacitive keys, otherwise all that extra height tends to feel a bit wasted. Speaking of those keys. The software To answer your first and greatest question: Yes, you can switch the order of the navigation keys. You can either have them in Samsung (read: wrong) order, or change them to the standard Android layout of back, home, and recent apps (left to right). Samsung also lets you customize the color of the navigation bar background, which is nice. Sure, the iconography is nowhere near stock, but I couldn't really give a damn what the buttons look like as long as they do what I expect them to. And no, Bixby is not mapped to long-pressing the home key: that's 100% Google Assistant. (Bixby's functional overlap with Assistant is actually quite minimal - for now.) The latest version of I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-TouchWiz is based on Android 7.0 (not 7.1, sigh) and feels basically similar to what we had on the Note7 and now have on the Galaxy S7 phones. "Grace UX" is the easiest on the eyes TouchWiz has ever been, and while there are still a bunch of old features in there I hardly think warrant the real estate in the settings app, Samsung continues to provide its own useful additions. I didn't spend much time with the software in-depth, as I really didn't have time. And Samsung's Bixby assistant was only demoed to us in a controlled, scripted test environment, which is useless from an evaluation perspective. I can give you the overview, though: it's basically Google Goggles meets Google Now meets voice-powered accessibility controls. It's definitely an interesting mesh of features, though Samsung's hardest push seems to be around the idea that people will want to use their voice to control things like their screen brightness, toggling the hotspot, picking a camera mode or filter, and generally controlling their device. I am, to put it bluntly, unconvinced anyone will use this. But maybe it'll win me over when our review units come in and I actually have a chance to put it to the test. But, if you were worried that Bixby was an attempt to subvert Google Assistant and replace it: please, don't be. Not yet, at least. Google Assistant and Bixby happily coexist on the Galaxy S8, and are frankly rather different products. Oh, and this is kind of interesting, I guess: Samsung has also implemented the fingerprint scanner gesture to bring down the notification bar. It's off by default, I think, but it's there. Like the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge after their respective Nougat updates, the S8 and S8+ don't actually display in their native, physical resolutions by default (they're set to full HD mode). I remain very divided on this choice: while I know the vast majority of people who own these phones will never, ever notice and reap considerable battery life returns as a result, why put in these more expensive ultra-high-res panels in the first place? Samsung's answer, of course, relies heavily on VR, because you need that Quad HD display mode to provide a good VR experience. But I don't think anyone, even Samsung, has actually produced compelling evidence that consumers care about VR (apart from the companies making VR products). I guess it comes down to the question of how much more a Quad HD panel of this type would cost to produce than a 1080p version. If it's not a big difference, then I guess I get where Samsung is coming from. One feature I found quite interesting is the new home button wake gesture. Simply press your finger on the home button that is shown in the always-on display mode for a moment, and the screen will wake, indicated by a light burst of haptic feedback. While obviously you won't get far if you have a fingerprint scanner lock set, you might be more likely to use Samsung's iris scan or face unlock features (the latter is new to the S8). Given rumors that Samsung intended to place the fingerprint scanner inside the display itself with the S8 but failed to achieve the necessary yields, I have to wonder if this is the compromise they've settled on: pushing customers away from the ubiquitous fingerprint scanner, for now, until their more impressive technology is ready for primetime. As for me, I probably wouldn't use the home button wake regardless - the fingerprint scanner is simply my preferred mode of authentication. The reader is definitely a bit of a reach on these phones, though, and even with my relatively long fingers I found the S8+ would definitely take some getting used to in terms of default hand positioning. Samsung's iris scanner tech is fast and very accurate, but I'm not always looking at my phone when I unlock it. Performance on the phones is not something I feel comfortable expressing any definitive opinion on at this time. They felt fine - not crazy fast, not particularly slow - but given the notoriety Samsung's phones have achieved for slowing down over time, my experience in a controlled demo environment is simply not going to be helpful in assessing these things. It's probably better for me to end that discussion here and save the extended thoughts for our review. I obviously can't judge battery life yet, but Samsung shared an interesting figure with me: the new batteries in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ feature much better cycle longevity than the ones in last year's phones. Whereas after a year of typical charge and discharge cycles last year's Galaxy S7 and S7 edge would see around 20% of their effective capacity lost, Samsung says that figure is more like 5% of capacity lost over a year on the S8 and S8+. That's definitely encouraging. Final thoughts The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are big, beautiful phones. The larger displays are absolutely great, and the switch to virtual navigation keys is long overdue. I'm sure they'll have great cameras, and I expect battery life will probably be largely comparable to last year's phones (i.e., good). TouchWiz is, as far as user experience goes, the best it's ever been. That may not be saying much for some of you, but I generally find Samsung's UI modifications at the very least aesthetically palatable nowadays, and some of the added features are genuinely useful. A switch to 64GB of storage as standard is absolutely welcome and, I think, should be the bar to meet for any flagship phone in 2017. Bixby, despite the fears of many (myself included), doesn't really seem meant to displace Google Assistant or search on your phone. The Snapdragon 835 version of the S8 and S8+ we'll get here in the US packs a lot of new and potent technology, too - it's not just faster than the 820 and 821, it's more efficient and more capable. What am I not loving yet? Launching with Android 7.0 feels oh so typical Samsung: they can preach all they want about how they test their software endlessly in order to ensure updates are smooth and low on bugs, but I just can't shake the feeling that Samsung really has no intention of changing its approach to Android platform updates. Performance is going to be a big question, too (and it's one Samsung seems uninterested in discussing). I won't even be able to conclusively come to an answer in our review, simply due to the amount of time we'll have to use the phones before publishing. That'll take weeks and months of additional testing. Finally, there's a lot of uncertainty remaining around the value proposition these phones will offer, and without pricing, that's hard to comment on just yet. There's also a lingering feeling that the S8 and S8+ feel iterative in terms of actual user experience versus being showcases for advancements in industrial design and engineering. Samsung itself seems very eager to present the reduced bezel and larger displays as the raison d'etre for the Galaxy S8. But it's hard to tell if beauty is more than skin deep with these phones. Why is the screen curved? Because it's pretty (fragile, and the edge UI experience sucks). Why is the aluminum frame now polished? Because it's pretty (and will get scratched). Why aren't the batteries any bigger? Because thin phones are pretty (even though everyone wants bigger batteries). These are thoughts that I've had a harder time shaking than I expected. There's no doubt the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are exceptional achievements from the standpoint of design and phone-building knowhow, but I think I can distill my feelings about them down to this: I'm really unsure why I'd want one of these that much more than a Galaxy S7 edge or, if it still existed, a Note7. If there's some major improvement to performance I missed, maybe that could be it, but on most other fronts - aside from the switch to virtual nav keys - I'm left scratching my head a bit. But, maybe that's just a result of not having enough time with them. Hopefully, we'll be reviewing these phones soon enough, as I'm eager to get a deeper sense of the changes Samsung's made and how they translate into a real-world product experience.

As for android 7.1 it really doesn't matter as samsung usually incorporates a lot of the new features long before they are available on newer android versions. Eagerly looking forward to the Note 8 though (4K screen for VR is going to be a much needed upgrade). Taylor Vaughn I freelance online, performing basic jobs which simply requires from you a laptop or computer as well as internet accessibility and it is a life-saver for me personally... After 6 months on this job opportunity and i gained so far total of 36,000 dollars... Basicly i make about eighty bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hour most of the days.And marvelous thing about this job is that you can easily manage time while you work and for how long as you like and you get paid weekly >> http://v15.uk/xbRHM MJ I agree 4K is much needed for VR but I would question 4K or VR on a phone. LOL Toss3 Why? Works much better on phones as they aren't tethered to anything. Personally only use it for watching movies on planes or in bed when the gf is sleeping. MJ That is your only use cases? It's more useless than I thought. I watch movies on my big screen TV on my sweet couch when the GF is sleeping. No heavy BDSM head gear needed. Toss3 Pretty much. Never liked watching movies on a TV as TVs are always really small (unless you buy one of those 40k ones that are 100"<). I had a projector (with a 120" screen), but I sold it when I moved to another country, and because I don't watch TV that often a "big-screen" TV just doesn't feel that useful. I also like being thoroughly engrossed in the movies I watch without any distractions and only the Gear VR has offered me anything like that thus far. It's also the first private movie-theater that you can take with you wherever you go. The low resolution is the only thing that could be improved (and the straps of course). MJ Sure if it works for you but I don't like things strapped to my head and face. It must be a pain to unstrap when need a drink, snack, or take a piss. Toss3 You either lift the device (similar to ski goggles or snorkel) or you use the built-in pass-through mode. And there's really no need to unstrap anything when going for a piss. MJ I didn't mean literally unstrap but none of that sounds convenient or practical at all. LOL It must be me... MJ Samsung has made a product I would almost consider buying by cleaning up the UX, going with on-screen buttons, better aspect ratio, and minimizing the edge gimmick (next just get rid of it) while keeping the headphone jack and wireless charging BUT... The placement of the fingerprint is just horrible. David, you went on how Samsung pays attention to the details but they just randomly place the fingerprint reader? OK... They still make me wary of getting timely OS updates. Android 7.0? Really? I like to see if they follow up on their promise of monthly security updates on their unlocked phones. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU My S7 Edge, unlocked, Romania, received Nougat but still on freaking January security update! How bout dat? MJ That sucks but didn't they just make that promise a couple of weeks ago? Cristian-Teodor TATOIU They made that promise months ago but with the new top dog in tow... They'll make good on S8, no doubt, for the first 6-7 months. Then, they'll have the S9 to keep them busy. And so on, and so on... Really, really, really want/need timely security updates? Pixel or whatever Google brings out is the way to go. Not freaking out cause of some security vulnerabilities going unpatched for months? Samsung is an option then... They'll update, sooner or... Jordan L my friend, who is kind of paranoid about security, loves the Galaxy series of phones(probably because they look great). From a data security prospective; do you think Pixel or Galaxy is "more secure". He's worried less about hacks on old versions of the OS, he's worried about his cloud data. I vote for Pixel because you are only logging in with your Google account, and not also logging into your phone with a "Samsung" account. to use features. yes, Google tracks everything you do, but they are a US based company. Samsung is not, ... just a thought. I would THINK he would HATE the fact that he logs into his phone with Samsung account too. (you do have to use a Samsung account to fully use a Galaxy phone, right?) Justin You don't have to log in to Samsung's account to use the phone, but you lose out on things like Samsung Pay if you don't. EcE You don't need a Samsung account unless you want Samsung Pay, themes ( and their crapstore) or VR. Even then, they are two different accounts and AFAIK you don't need to share any private information to the Samsung account unless you use Samsung Pay. Vivek Rameses A non us company is much safer and private. Muh americans love garbage made in the US. dabug91 The Pixel would be the superior choice, as they will get monthly security updates through October 2019 at least. Max Johnson Battery size is concerning, but maybe that's something to do with precaution with the fire issue. Lawrence Fail!: It is way too tall, fingerprint sensor on the back, small battery, new bixie assistant with dedicated button, same old camera. Win. 64gb storage, looks cool. Biga173rd So what's a win in your book that can compare to this new phone? Zsolt V The same phone with a fruity fruit logo Biga173rd Ehhhh lno lol Lawrence Thanks for asking : the S7 and S7 edge... Better battery/size ratio same camera, same ram. Front fingerprint, and they can be hold by humans. Biga173rd Good point I personally will wait for the Note 8. Toss3 Agreed on the fingerprint sensor, but it does have face-unlock which should be a useful alternative (it is on Win 10 devices). I seriously don't understand why these companies are forcing AI assistans on us? Do people really use them? AI is useful, but not for phones. Camera is already good enough; use pro mode and it's amazing. Really can't expect better in a phone right now unless you start increasing the sensor size. EcE " this looks good on the Midnight Black version of the phone, which features a shiny black mid-frame to match" Glad to see the black phone is black on the sides, that chrome version looks horrible. Marcel Mayer hä? the device will show on 5pm? why you publish the article? PhillipeFelut so, whats the actual resolution of the display itself? DeathWolfGaming They are set to 1080p to save battery life. PhillipeFelut 2960x1440 is the number i was looking for. Jesse Lee Samsung is really receptive to their markets; a completely opposite direction from years past and from that being employed by Google Inc. The results are phones that continue to get better and better and more practical. Looks great! Timbets Linux 4.4 kernel Ishimaru I'm surprised. Even Google is still on 3.x. ProductFRED I'm not jumping to sell my S7 Edge Exynos just yet. Gotmilo waiting for the note 8 JD It's a damn solid phone. I wouldn't jump unless I pooped money and was having a bad case of the runs. Winston I'm upgrading from my flat S7 to the small S8. Why? Battery has deteriorated, and Samsung usually does really lucrative trade in deals with older phones, of which I still have an S4. John New smartphone releases are beginning to be as exciting as new dishwasher releases. That's a good thing as it means we can hold on to our phones for longer, smaller manufacturers can catch up to the big boys, and there will be more price competition rather than feature competition. Samsung seems to realize this which is why they're making a big push to differentiate on software. We would benefit from more alternatives to Google's software. I'm just skeptical that Samsung is capable. BC Um, why no images of the Dialer App's interface? It's something that I always want to know but never can readily find. David Ruddock Because I had an hour with the phones total and that wasn't really on my priority list. Sorry. BC It's cool, I'm just a weirdo that likes to know what all the interfaces I'll be interacting with regularly look within OEM apps. Cakefish Just look up the S7 Nougat update UI. I am pretty sure it'll be very similar to that, the rest of the S8's UI is. BC Not good enough for me, though I'll likely preorder the device...I'll be able to see it firsthand this way. Cakefish Check out the bajillion youtube hands-on videos, I'm sure one of them has what you're looking for :) BC I can only hope, though I have a feeling nobody will even care about the Dialer App. Cakefish Found one for ya! Look at 2:12 in the video: https://youtu.be/sZvp4L52QzQ BC Thank you! I had begun the scanning of videos to catch a hint of that app interface. Phone_Addiction Time to ditch my ip7 plus for the gs8+ brararsh Thinking of same. Adil Tajgeer i'm in the same boat but with the regular S8, it seems to be a great blend of big screen in a small package. but will just keep my iphone around. I NEED ALL THE SHINY THINGS. Biga173rd Wow!! that is one gorgeous phone. The build quality is incredible damn Sammy knocked it out of the park. And that metal frame... Nuno G. "You can either have them in Samsung (read: wrong)" Although it's not the standard order for Android, for me it's the natural order, specially for right handed persons!!! When I hold the phone, I hold normally with my right hand, so my thumb finger is the finger that is most near the screen on the right side of it. so it's normal for me to have the back button cause that's the one that I use more.. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Right handed persons" all have different preferences, I am right handed and I use the back button on the left. Middlefinger Im a lefty and Samsungs is still the better positioning. Google just have it wrong but the fanbois on here would never disagree with their Google god. JD Gotta say it wasn't until the S7e that I started to look at Samsung and that Samsung actually got me excited about Android Hardware again. I used to be a Nexus Diehard and when Google and other OEMs just all made glass rectangles, some with really bad software decisions I just gave up. But the S7e was something interesting. The S8 is a really lovely piece of Industrial engineering, like what the OG iPhone and iPhone 4 did to the industry when everyone was doing more of the same. jonzey231 I love that they continue to include wireless charging. iKon It's not even wireless... False advertising more like. jonzey231 Kay. Sharky I've been on Nexus for 5 years but I'm going to give this a go. The bezel-less screen makes it look like something genuinely new, I really wish the Pixel had looked this. I'm still skeptical about Samsung's UI skin but the move to virtual (& customizable!) buttons alleviates that a bit. Hopefully this will encourage Google to step up their efforts with the next Pixel, but it's going to take a big jump from last year's model to get me back. Jay The skin has not been a concern since s7. The whole look can be altered with one click via the theme store. I use one that makes it either look like native android or a jet black theme, that's so enjoyable on these amoled screens. Daniel Tiberius I'm looking forward to playing around with those themes. Middlefinger *S6. Sharky Admittedly the skin does looks quite nice now, I certainly hope I'm converted now I've shelled out $850 on this thing. Kevin Chaos I'm using the S7 and I really want the S8... but I'm going to force myself to wait and at least see what Apple has to offer with their next iPhone. That or Google needs to fix the Android messaging clusterfuck they've created. I've been using Android phones since the Nexus One but iPhones have come a long way and iMessage is starting to look really good. Toss3 Not sure why anyone with an S7/S7E would feel the urge to upgrade. Why not use something like Telegram, Whatsapp, etc. instead of SMS? Kevin Chaos I have a problem with wanting new toys constantly, haha. I think I've gotten a new phone every 6 months. Almost everyone I know uses SMS here. I am also using Google Voice myself. I just don't have enough friends who use those apps. At least that's my case in the United States. Toss3 I used to be like that, but now that Android has matured and caught up with the iPhone in terms of smoothness, I really don't feel the urge to upgrade as often as I used to. Only thing I want right now is an HDR 4K screen for the Note 8 and I'll be happy. Adil Tajgeer iMessage has kept my pixel and OP3 in a drawer for most of their time with me. but the S8 is so pretty i will probably bite the bullet and face the shame of the green bubble. fijisiv Why is the screen curved? Because it's pretty... Why is the aluminum frame now polished? Because it's pretty... Why aren't the batteries any bigger? Because thin phones are pretty... While most AP readers probably do a LOT of research before buying a phone, I'd wager a huge majority of phone purchases are done by people who walk into the store and say "oh that one looks pretty." Toss3 Thankfully we still have the Note-series that should cater to a different audience (hopefully). Adnoxaei It's beautiful, but I'll be skipping it it :/ The fingerprint scanned is just in a terrible spot for my normal usage. I hope one of those scanner techs that can go through the screen can get implimented in the next couple generations. Winston It was reportedly very close to being in the S8, but they couldn't quite get something good enough for it to be signed off. So, Note 8? Adnoxaei The note line got the iris scanner, so it is possible. I already think the S8 is a bit big (really, just too tall), so maybe it can be in the S9 and I'll get it then. At least my bank account will be happuer this year haha. Rann Xeroxx Once you use a scanner on the back of the phone, it actually turns out to be better as that is where your fingers typically are when holding the device. The only problem I can see is if you have it on a table or something and want to use the scanner. (I never do this as I rarely will leave my phone on a table). Miguel Fernandes How can it be better with that limitation? Jan Ibrahim Because in most circumstances for a lot of people , you unlock as you remove from your pocket. This is a lot easier with it on the back. Furthermore, it also means you can achieve a nice clean look on the front of the phone. But no solution is perfect, because the downside is desk use. But i find on the odd occasion I'm using my phone on my desk then pattern lock is fine. But I'd rather have on the back with that limitation than the other way around. Look how ugly the fingerprint scanners look on the front of some of the HTC and oneplus phones for example. John My problem with the S8 is not that the scanner is on the back, which is fine, but that it's all the way up next to the camera. Below the camera would have made more sense. iKon It's only good on the back, if it's in the middle like Huawei devices. Samsung has the worst position out of everyone. My name is…. Google needs to take lessons on how to make pretty phones. Who's gonna prefer a pixel to this? Crazy fanboys only. saf1927 People who actually want a phone. No flat display, no good. My name is…. Pixel was a joke of a phone, i cant believe that Google gave that thing iphone price, so ridiculous. Im sure S8 will be better in every aspect. asian_slaw if you are solely hating on the phone because of the price, you definitely dont understand or have experienced the pixel to it's full potential My name is…. I had a pixel on my hands. i also was an owner of all Nexus phones (after Nexus 4) I would never buy a pixel. There are better phones out there that are better. saf1927 Yes, after coming out half a year later, it doesn't take that much to get a better phone out. By the way, the iPhone 7 will still outperform the S8. it’s me tim-cock. Dude calm your tits. This phone puts the garbage looking iphone and pixel to shame. Your move crapple. saf1927 Come again when Samsung actually puts out a phone that is better than an iPhone in all aspects. A high-res display is nothing to flash your ass out for. Lars Jeppesen Yeah, much better display, more ram, better waterproofness, more freedom (default app anyone? ), wireless charging, fast charging, iris scanner, much higher screen-to-phone ratio, SD card support, bluetooth 5, wifi direct, VR, better assistant (Google Assistant/Bixby),, OH YEAH_, the iPhone sure is better... /s saf1927 >much better display Doesn't make a difference since the iPhone has one of the best and most accurate displays in the market. > more ram Well, with the bloat you get from it, I think it's a plus that it has the RAM to cope with it. >better waterproofness Not a deal-breaker >more freedom Nothing to do with Samsung, it's general Android feature. > fast charging / wireless charging I'll give you the first, the second is a gimmick and not really "wireless". >iris scanner A gimmick you can live without > SD card support Not needed since you can't install apps on it. > bluetooth 5 Nice, but the phone is coming out in 2017, least they could do. > better assistant Google Assistant, yes. Bixby is yet to prove itself. Now, when Samsung and Qualcomm can match the A10 performance, let's talk. Rann Xeroxx Why on Earth would you pay the absurd price for the Pixel compared to a phone like this? Heck, the Pixel is ugly to boot. And purely from an enterprise standpoint, it has real problems with MDM and ActiveSync configurations to where Samsung goes out of their way to make sure it works perfectly on corporate solutions. saf1927 I actually have an iPhone 7 too, which of course is better than anything Samsung puts out. Looks are subjective. I hate edge displays, so this phone is as ugly as it gets. someone755 Agreed, keep it flat so I can put a normal screen protector on it. JohnyNoLegs Can't even do that on the pixel. These days are over someone755 Then I simply won't buy a phone like that, and I advise anyone that sympathizes with my hate of curved screens to do the same. Vote with your wallet. New_Guy Somebody just dropped some world-class knowledge. Kudos Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "the Pixel is ugly" - ever heard looks are subjective? I really like the design of the Google Pixel. More than the edge display on the Galaxy phones. h4rr4r Good you can fix the keys! Can you change the settings menu to be normal? Winston Nope, from my time with the S7. And I imagine that will soon be the new normal. Android O DP already has a similar design. So it will soon become normal. h4rr4r Please google, stop moving shit around for the sake of moving shit around. Winston You are the one moving shit around. I don't know what the hell the incentive is for lying, but I have a Galaxy S7. I have a Fast Charger. I have tried both turning the fast charger off in software, AND using a different cable. They both kept my phone cool while charging when using it, and with fast charging on it would heat up. h4rr4r I did not decide to move the buttons around at random or change the settings to some touchwiz crap. I have no idea what you are talking about with the charger. I said nothing about fast chargers. Of course fast chargers make the phone hotter. How do you think this all works? Winston It's not "considerable battery gains". They're actually fairly small: within 10-15 mins SOT in my experience. Samsung itself said, moving from the 5.7 1080p of the Note 3 to the 1440p of the 4, that the power usage delta was 3.5%. That's in hardware. Imagine how little the change is in software. lsh99 The build and design of this phone is exactly what I've been waiting for: premium finishes with a huge screen-to-body ratio. That said, I'm waiting for the Note 8. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Pricing, for Europe - 799EUR for S8, 899EUR for S8+. These should translate 1:1 to USD + taxes, for US. Of course, unlocked. Turb0wned The question is, if I ordered the US unlocked version from Best Buy, will Samsung screw me out of updates like they did with the unlocked S7E? Trysta After a major Samsung phone reveal, I usually spend the first couple days trying to rationalize how I could buy it even though touchwiz scares me, because the hardware is just so lust-worthy. But this time...not so much. It looks very fancy obviously, and I love the increased screen to body ratio (hopefully all other OEMs....*cough* Google *cough* are paying attention!). But I thought the Note 7, with the extra subtle curves was really the maximum amount of screen curve I was willing to deal with. The curve of the S8/S8+ seems to be going back towards obnoxious taking over 20% of the screen with glare again. Wish they had kept the curved edges the way they were on the Note 7. Batteries are too small, although I understand why they wanted to be careful this year. After my Nexus 6p disappointment, battery life is basically my number one feature for my next phone. And the fingerprint sensor placement is just awful, for seemingly no other reason than to be different from everyone else who has a back fingerprint sensor. I don't want to use iris scanning or face detection. Fingerprint sensors work really well for turning on my phone quickly. This is a major feature of all current flagships. Why did they think this was something that was ok to experiment with/mess up? But in the end, just like every year, I was never going to buy this phone anyway. I hope that it is a great phone for Samsung fans (I'm sure it will be). Shame-sung C.E.O Absolutely horrible looking phone.that it lacks innovation and nothing but gimmicky features. Dominic D ok it’s me tim-cock. As if anyone expect anything diffraction from you. Shame-sung C.E.O Why would anyone expect anything positive from a CORRUPT, thief company? Middlefinger Doesnt do thieving Apple or LG much harm though, or HTC with their new iPhone rip-offs. Shame-sung C.E.O You are mistaken the Corrupt Swinesung Machine that has been sued by. Apple,Dyson,BlackBerry,Microsoft,LG,TSMC And countless other manufactures for stealing. Hmm you sound like those Swinesung guys that were getting paid to Shill and got caught. You can only wish that Apple and LG and anyone else was as horrible as corrupt company as Swinesung. But unlike you i stand by Facts, go ahead and get upset. Not going to change history. : ) Middlefinger Selectively sued in countries with crap IP laws where you can patent anything vague and sue for it even if you never actually made the thing yourself. They failed to sue in countries with reasonable laws. Samsung also counter sued and won, so whatever... Shame-sung C.E.O That's a beautiful excuse. But not a good one. Funny how Swinesung has lost multiple times and agrees to settle after it has uses stolen designs and software and technology. Swingeing has lost all across the world from its home country to the the US. This is the problem with the fanboy mentality. They make poor excuses but everything is online. Swinesung has convicted 2 times of corruption in south korea alone. From Racketeering, Tax Evasion. Fraud and Embezzlement and countless other charges. Also they have the highest return in TV's in the industry with defects. Heck in the S7 and S6,5,4 have all suffered from low quality screens and having image retention issues (again all the information is online if you search) to burn in issues and lets not forget the exploding issues because they choose quantity over quality. Shamesung will always be just that. A low quality company who cares about numbers then quality. Middlefinger You're just a troll, yuor username proves that all by itself. Most of the thing Samsung have been sued for related directly to Android itself, so is Googles fault if anything, not anything they have done. You know this but just troll this site because you are a child with nothing better to do. Dont bother replying, your blocked as of now. Shame-sung C.E.O AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Facts hurt and hurt so dam much . Man how pathetic. Jay Not sure how your kind of comments continue to survive on this site. Shame-sung C.E.O Because people are entitled to facts and opinions. Just because Swinesung is a horrible corrupt company does not mean bling ignorance does not exist. I mean i like Android and think its amazing and useful, And i feel the same way about Apple , Microsoft LG ect. But Swinesung... Naw i draw the line on the most corrupt company in the tech industry by Parsec's. Dominic D I just wish Samsung would update all their devices at the same time like Apple. Okay, maybe not all... but definitely their S series of devices. It's holding me back from purchasing a Samsung phone again. My AT&T S6 Edge was beautiful but didn't receive Marshmallow for a year. It was nearly unusable on Lollipop with barely an hour and a half of screen-on time. I love my 6P and I'm soon looking to upgrade, but I'm nervous about purchasing another Samsung device. Berkay Wait for the pixel 2 Ilya Kushnir Linux Kernel 4.4.16. This happened! Maha Rashtrian TAKE MY MONEY NOW! How much does it cost though? Mix If Samsung made a phone with stock Android, that had Google's updates I would be in love. My Pixel is nice but Samsung phones just feel nicer. JSo Remember Google Play Edition devices? Those were the days. Mix I do not! My first was Android was a Nexus 4 and I came from a BB Bold! Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Galaxy S6, Pixel Xl, Pixel Xl, Pixel Xl....(I am on my third Pixel, lol) JSo Well other OEMs used to make versions of there devices with stock android on it and they were sold in the Play Store. The Galaxy S4 was one of them. Jaime May I ask why? Were your phones faulty? Mix Mic died on the 1st Pixel and the 2nd one bricked and both were RMA'd through the play store for brand new devices. someone755 "The Pixel is totally worth it, it's a great investment." You alone are proof of the contrary. Mix Just pop on over to GooglePixel on Reddit. Some people are on their 5th phone...when it works it works but my experience? This is the worst Android phone I have ever owned! My 3rd one has been great though so fingers crossed I am done RMA'ing it. someone755 Exactly. There are so many apologists out there of this phone that keep saying that the phone is worth its price, that other phones are just as flawed etc. Meanwhile there are hundreds if not thousands of customers like you. VAVAMk_2 Why? Mix Mic died on the 1st Pixel and the 2nd one bricked and both were RMA'd through the play store for brand new devices. Support has been great but my phone experience has been terrible. 2kool4skool Agreed, google gets their software right but their hardware could use a lot of improvement. JohnyNoLegs Yea like messenger, allo, duo, hangouts. And pixel now has apps you can't uninstall. Google will be the next Samsung! 2kool4skool Well, should I say partly right, then? JohnyNoLegs Let's just say Samsung does it better than google recently, and that's saying something. Btw I'm on pixel xl coming from note 7. iKon Any phone looks better than the Pixels because #Bezels Bojan Radovanović well, that is true, but it's not a picture to stand in front of it and admire how it looks... Ra1nb0wD4sh DE On my pictures the bezels (aka frames) are mostly wanted though... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Samsung made the phone with stock Android, nobody except a bunch of geeks would buy it. Consumers want the features Samsung adds to Android. Mix Would the average user and purchaser of Samsung phones even know they had stock Android device? Probably not. Samsung makes mach better hardware but their updates and support after the sale freaking suck. Took something like 8 months for my SG6 phone to get an update since Google gives it to Samsung to add shit, then Telus gets to add shit, then I get it. That type of update system is pure trash. theProffer It's the same group of people that can't tell the difference between the new iPhones. You know, the ones Jimmy Kimmel makes fun of once a year. Middlefinger Samsung have to fix Googles mess first, because lets face it, Stock android is a buggy unreliable mess. You cant blame the OEMs for wanting to wait until the software is viable before they risk putting it on their customers devices. Google doesn't care, that's why the Nexus didnt sell well, and the pixel has needed fix after fix after fix. whispy_snippet No. Middlefinger Yes, but Google shills dont like to hear it. whispy_snippet Still no! Middlefinger Denial is pretty powerful. Jay Nothing in the pixel has been so broken, that's its stopped from being a consistent daily driver with over 6.5 hours SOT and over a day of standby. Issues have been present yes, but so have been with any phone. My iPhone 7+ ended up getting replaced twice... once because the damn camera unit entirely died 2 days later and secondly when the screen stopped responding. Then iOS 10.2 decided to suffer from Wi-Fi issues and all sorts of weird documented bugs. Nothing is ever 'PERFECT' However since that does not fit your narrative, it's not a thing. Middlefinger Most pixe issues are software/driver related, and thats always been the way with Google devices, although the Nexus range also had terrible build quality as well. At least the Pixel is better on that front. The problem is stock android, which is why the OEMs need to modify it to be production worthy. Im sure you will make excuses, but thats the reality. LineOS for exynos! What Better quality? The besel king! This and the iPhone Middlefinger Like it or not the Pixel is a step up over the likes of the N5, which was terrible. There was a reason the older Nexus devices were cheap, and it had nothing to do with Google 'subsidising' them. LineOS for exynos! Compared to Nexus the pixel are good but is nothing compar to Galaxy or even Huawei. The Nexus is meant to race with the iPhone.. in the meantime they​ only race to the biggest bezels whispy_snippet Well, no. Every average Joe consumer would buy it PLUS a heap of stock Android nerds. Average consumers don't have a freakin clue what TouchWiz or stock Android even are. Who gives a shit anyway. It's never going to happen. trapchan Nah, stock Android can't even block sms spam by phrase, and it took them how many years just to implement call blocking? I had it since iPhone 5. Middlefinger Oh god no. Bargain basement software that isnt reliable isnt what people want. Im sure even a stock S8 would have less issues than the trouble prone Nexus and Pixel phones, but even so, it would be commercial suicide for Samsung to rely on an unfiltered Google experience. someone755 It would net them a few thousand customers though. I know I'd be switching to a Samsung if they only made some AOSP-style software possible. Middlefinger Apple could probably sell more iPhones if they had an Android version, but it still doesnt mean it will happen. It would cheapen the Samsung brand to launch an AOSP version, and the only people that would care could just run a custom ROM anyway. someone755 Agreed on all but that last part -- That's why I'm not already a Samsung customer, as they make great efforts to prevent people from running custom ROMs. Middlefinger and yet suck ROM exist, so.. xyz It was called a Galaxy Nexus. JohnyNoLegs I prefer Samsung software. My pixel xl is barron, has nothing in comparison. Can't wait to sell and get the s8 gacl The Pure Google experience of Nexus + Pixel is nice, but Samsung hardware is nicer. A Google Play Edition Samsung would be better, but it's not that big a deal. TouchWiz is nice too. Cakefish The fact that I'm currently unemplyed will prevent me from giving in to my uncontrollable urges to always have the latest tech. S8 looks great. Switchable nav keys, 10nm processors, batteries that lose significantly less of their capacity over time. narrower dimensions for one-handed use, 64GB storage, and a Samsung equivalent to Google's HDR+ camera processing are my personal highlights. Cakefish P.S. for UK users you can get it on the 19th April if you preorder (8 days early). Also, UK pricing: S8 = £689.00, S8+ = £779.00 Middlefinger Yeah but will be cheap enough on contract which is how most people buy phones. Cakefish But I prefer to buy unlocked :( Lars Jeppesen Blame Brexit for that.. the phones are the same prices as the S7 for me here in Denmark Cakefish I do blame Brexit :( ddevito Nice phone, but no thanks. Perfectly comfy with my OP3. Then again I've never owned a Samsuck and never will james fuston jeeeesus the price point. S8 is anywhere from 720-750 and the S8+ is 850? We are getting dangerously close to breaking the 1K mark with standard configurations for phones. I can't justify paying twice the street price of an S7/S7E for one of these. This will be a hard pass for me. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The LG G6 is $750 and the Pixel XL is $869, and those two phones look pitiful compared to the S8 and S8 Plus. What are you complaining about? Cakefish 21% (S8 vs S7) and 22% (S8+ vs S7 edge) price rises for UK (thanks Brexit) hkklife Pixel XL is the biggest rip-off on the market that's not made by Apple. Google was redefining the $/performance ratio back in 2012 and 2013 with the Nexus 4/5 and Nexus 7s. And then they got greedy and cozied back up to the carriers and went sky-high with their pricing. I'd love to see the BoM for HTC and Google on the Pixels. Gotta give Samsung credit for not jettisoning important features while truly redefining what a rectangular slab handset should be. I still think that the S8 line is one step from greatness---an unlocked model updated in a timely fashion with a 6/128GB RAM/storage variant for all markets and a 500mAh battery boost would make it a world-beater. David Williams I agree. The price point should not be surprising to anyone. james fuston The Pixel XL is $779. Not sure where you're pulling that extra $100 from. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The 128 GB model is $869. There is no 64GB model. Regardless, the price differences aren't very big either way, and the Pixel XL doesn't hold a candle to the S8 Plus in terms of form OR function. james fuston Yeah, you're either entirely missing or intentionally glossing over the "standard configuration" part. Either way, I can tell you're all aboard the hype train for new technology by the amount of hyperbole you're spouting. Not sure why you felt like chiming in on my comment about the cost/value of the S8 vs the S7, but I think we're done here. Diego Kaku Why no one talks about the stupid position of the fingerprint scanner? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I hate the location of the fingerprint scanner on the S8/Plus. Absolutely despise it. But the rest of the phone is f'in amazing. And it's possible I'd end up using iris or facial recognition anyway. I'm not buying one, but that's only because I'm waiting for the Note 8. Fresh360 Well that was depressing, has all of those leaks left us jaded? What if there were no leaks and only whispers and then we saw a nearly bezel-less phone with a massive screen in a small body? I really think this preview would have had a very different tone. Suresh Aryal Nothing about speakers yet. GSMArena says it has stereo speakers. invinciblegod OH GOD MY OCD!! Those ports are not centered!!!!!!! Groud Frank Samsung Mobile is maturing as a tech company. It's no longer "Let's just copy Apple and cram features into our phones to compete with the iPhone." From Samsung Pass to Samsung Pay to Bixby to DeX, this is a beautiful phone with useful features. I can actually see this phone making my life easier, especially in the password management department. Less navigating, less touching, a focus on user experience and practicality - well done Samsung. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I think Samsung is going to break sales records with these phones. Max Gromada Well, they just "copied" those features: - google's HDR+, - the next iphone's screen proportions; - apple pay, - modern ai voice assistant (they've bought the company that had made the Siri), - apple's augmented reality tech - Nokia's / MS iris scanner. They're welcome to implement a feature-rich phone, but those innovations did not come from Samsung. Tech Writer -Combining multiple photos into one has been a thing much before google did it. Does anyone remember OPPO's 50MP super hi-def mode? Plus I'm sure the implementation is different than Pixel's HDR+. For example, this one works without HDR, and with HDR too. -Next iPhone's screen proportions? Dude, are you kidding me. Samsung is the one who is going to provide those screens to Apple. Plus, this phone is probably in development much before the iPhone. -Apple pay: No. Samsung pay uses MST, not NFC. It's a unique patented tech by looppay, which Samsung acquired. Apple can't even use it and hence Apple pay can't operate in legacy terminals. -modern ai voice assistant: Bixby is not a voice assistant. The phone has google assistant for that. Bixby is more of helper and tells you what is around you. It isn't meant to tell you a joke or search things, you have assistant for that. -apple's augmented reality tech: I really don't know what you are talking about. -Iris scanner: I'll give you that. Most of these are Samsung's own innovations, or acquisitions which are patented. Max Gromada Tech Writer, man, combining multiple photos into one has been a thing since the invention of photography ) It's just Google that made it ideal for the phones - combining multiple pics of several milliseconds of exposure into one is a brilliant idea, it greatly expands the dynamic range of small sensors, and i think every manufacturer should just copy that tecnique. Doesn't matter if they call it "hdr" or not. It improves dr, that's all we need. No, i'm not kidding - some time ago, Apple approached Koreans with the question if they could supply the screens of some specs - and voila - while Apple is still playing with the idea, figuring out if the screen should be curved or not, and how the f.. are they going to install the fingerprint scanner right into the screen... the Koreans just rolled out the phones of very similar screen proportions. I don't think this is just a coincidence. Call it a controversial bull..it ) The idea behind Apple pay was simply to pay by phone conveniently. Dunno, maybe Samsung's tech is better, but they were following Apple. I think augmented reality features are the next big thing for smartphones. Project Tango did not start well, but apple is working on it, samsung is working on it - NOT a coincidence. I don't argue with the point that Samsung is a great tech company. The point of my comment was that Samsung is still some way into "Let's copy Apple and cram features into our phones to compete with the iPhone." They definitely are set into direct competition with iphone, and at this moment, from my point of view, there are no features that apple would like to copy from samsung to compete with it. Groud Frank "The next iPhone". They copied features from a phone that doesn't even exist? Are you serious? Dude, stop making a fool of yourself😂 Middlefinger Quite a bit of salt in this article. Samsungs nav buttons are not in the 'wrong' order, Googles are. Argue all you like but the fact remains its subjective and not objective. Im glad Samsung doesnt use Googles staid UX. and you cant complain about Samsung not being as innovative in the software as they are in the hardware and simultaneously get snarky about them not using Googles way of doing things. Google hasnt innovated a damn thing since ICS so if they did make a stock S8 it would be worse, based on your own claim. dabug91 Actually, you're wrong. When you use just about any web browser on the planet, where is the back button located? Top Left. Same for when you use just about any file explorer: Top Left. Same for when you use iOS devices, where do they generally place the back button? Top Left. It makes perfect sense for the back button to be on the left side of the device, because that IS the ergonomically and aesthetically superior place for it. You're wrong, get over yourself. Middlefinger Use with a mouse is different than touch use, and 2 handed touch use is different than one. You are comparing completely different UI element, so your point is invalid. dabug91 Actually, people's thumbs can very easily reach the bottom left hand side of their device, so your distraction about UI's is invalid and you're still wrong. Kys. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I hold my phone in my left hand, and use it with my right hand. The position of the back button makes no difference to me, but I like it on the right. It's not an objective thing. Give up trying to make it so. Middlefinger Right is still better for the most often used function. Given the option most people I know have that set up. Google cant be trusted to know whats best in a UI. This is the company that gave us material design, an admittedly pretty interface that gives you hardly any information per page. Its cumbersome, and this is proven by the fact that they cant even keep it consistent in their own apps, because it just doesnt work properly. Max Gromada Regarding 2-handed touch use, find the "Esc" key on your keyboard ) But, imho, when you're doing it all with your thumb, it does not matter what side the "back" key is placed. I was comfortable with the both layouts. trapchan Do you even realize that Backspace key is always placed on the right side of the keyboard, and not on the left side? You point is invalid, get over it. AbbyZFresh I'm sure that this new phone will be a hot commodity likurges I was about to make a joke about the bezzels but there are none.. unlike on the pixel where I have parked my airplane, built a house and a f1 track with some space left. SAM While improvements are welcomed, battery and camera didn't get much attention this year. Lets hope after everything other is taken care of this year, battery and camera will be next. I have a feeling that with what google achieved in pixel's camera, next iPhone(maybe) and pixel 2 will blow the shit out of competition. Max Gromada Actually, the camera is improverd in S8: there is a multi-exposure mode, aka pixel's HDR+, a very welcome feature. SAM I really wish this is the case. They didn't talk much about camera in live stream. Ace Time to buy gs7 _jsw_ Is that the new Gear 360 I see in the background? It's in the image of the S8+ on the stand. Max Gromada Yes, they've introduced the new Gear 360 someone755 That's all great and all, but these prices are getting ridiculous. r0xp0x Too bad even the regular sized one is a tad bit too big for me, and I don't like having a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, but it sure is gorgeous. whispy_snippet The headline feature is a big, bezzeless display. Meh. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, never mind the 835, the two types of wireless charging, the Samsung Pay, the HDR screen, the... oh, never mind. You wouldn't care, anyway. whispy_snippet No. I don't. They're just iterations on stuff Samsung always offers. They bring very little to the table that wasn't already there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Then buy a Pixel. You'll love its football field sized bezels, and the wonderful halos in its pictures. Yeah, I keep hearing that halos are rare. Another site just published a comparison of 22 pictures between the LG G6 and the Pixel. 4 of the 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the G6 pictures had halos. So it's not so rare, unless you think 18% of photos is rare. whispy_snippet I have a Pixel. I've experienced the halo effect maybe twice ever. I barely see it because you don't generally shoot straight into strong light sources because it results in crappy shots with any camera. The most important thing for me is user experience. What's the device like to use and own on a daily basis? The Pixel is exceptional in this metric. Great software, great ergonomics, great camera, regular updates, excellent performance. The S8 looks really beautiful, but I see UX compromises everywhere. The off centre, rear mounted fingerprint scanner next to the camera; the glass back; the curved edge display; two voice assistants (yes, they don't fully overlap but Samsung's end goal will be to bump Google Assistant). The S8 is just another new phone. Semianonymous Having voice control over the camera can actually be pretty useful. I have the speak to capture feature enabled on my S7 and it's enabled me to capture some tricky shots that might not have turned out as nicely if I had moved my hand to take the shot. If it's intelligent enough to do stuff like recognize the target and focus/zoom etc, then that could be potentially be really cool. Renan I'd wish Samsung would made a flat version of this... I find the Edge... edges useless. mchalakov Dear Samsung, Just because you think that a curved screen is really cool(it is but just for a presentation) doesn't mean that everybody will like it. Also who the fuck decided it's a good idea to put the fingerprint reader there? Best wishes and less explosions, Yours (some) part of the Internet PVL_93_RU To think that if Samsung didn't keep the archaic home and capacitive buttons for as long as they did - many more of their devices could look just as beautiful as S8 Teja The best thing I like about S8 is that they have made it without compromising on any of the features from their last generation despite having a big change in design. *cough* Headphone Jack *cough* Stadi I don't like the polished frame. Shiny metal has been out of fashion for some time. gacl I'm disappointed the S8 has no s-pen stylus support. It seems like Samsung deliberately withheld that to justify a separate Note8, but the Note line is basically the same as the Galaxy line. The S8+ is already a phablet. Just merge the two. Or at least let Galaxy users get s-pen support even if the device doesn't hold the pen internally. trapchan kinda underwhelming. no under screen fingerprint sensor, same kind of screen as LG G6, same camera as S7, and the "scream quality" thing is not even close to iPhone. Compare the charging port and speaker hole side by side, and you'll know which one "scream quality".

Google Search, commonly referred to as Google Web Search or simply Google, is a web search engine developed by Google. It is the most-used search engine on the World Wide Web, handling more than three billion searches each day. As of February 2016 it is the most used search engine in the US with 64.0% market share. The main purpose of Google Search is to hunt for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1997. Google Search provides several features beyond searching for words. These include synonyms, weather forecasts, time zones, stock quotes, maps, earthquake data, movie showtimes, airports, home listings, and sports scores. There are special features for numbers, dates, and some specific forms, including ranges, prices, temperatures, money and measurement unit conversions, calculations, package tracking, patents, area codes, and language translation. In June 2011 Google introduced "Google Voice Search" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words. Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends. Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys. As of mid-2016, Google's search engine has begun to rely on these deep neural networks.

However, this change didn’t make its way to the web, at least not for everyone. Now, though, it seems that Google is getting ready to roll out the new UI in a big way. The best gifts for Android users Via Google’s support forums, the company recently revealed that a redesign to the sign-in page on the web will be updating to a new look, which is a lot like what is in place on mobile devices. That’s to say it features elements of material design and an overall cleaner look. Along with that, the new design is also responsive, allowing it to format better on a variety of screen sizes. The functionality won’t be changed at all, just the visuals. Users will still need to enter their email address first, followed by their password and, if enabled, two-step authentication. A Google product manager tells VentureBeat that this new UI will be rolling out over the next few weeks, so don’t panic if your sign-in page suddenly looks different. The company is also showing a small notification on the current sign-in page to notify users of the coming change.

Aegis Capital has a Buy rating and price target of $1,011 on Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). The ratings on Facebook, Twitter and Snap are Buy, Sell and Hold, respectively. Search Spend Merkle reported that search spend on Google accelerated by 2 points to 21 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of 2017, from 19 percent in Q4 2016. Growth in Q1 was 23 percent on a two-year stacked basis, versus 20 percent in the prior quarter. Search on Google remains healthy, and data released by both Merkle and IgnitionOne suggest “a continuation of these positive trends this year,” Anthony mentioned. He added, “The Search strength should give comfort to investors” who have been concerned about the brand advertiser backlash at YouTube leading to significant estimate reductions. Separately, Google announced that advertisers worldwide had measured more than 4 billion store visits in AdWords, representing 400-percent growth from the 1 billion measured as of May 24, 2016. Ad Spend On Social Media Merkle indicated that Facebook may report another robust quarter, similar to Q4 2016. “Instagram continues to be their fastest growing ad platform, but off a low base,” the analyst wrote. Advertisers continue to experiment with ads on Twitter, but there is “no consistent commitment” or any continued ad spend, like there is on Facebook. Referring to Snap, Anthony commented that “a ‘small’ number of clients are making ‘big’ investments in Snap in hopes of seeing if there are benefits to being a first mover on the app.” It was still yearly to tell whether advertisers would see any longer-term potential. Snap could meet or beat revenue estimates in Q1. “However, in the few short days since launch, we are starting to see FB users use Stories and that could pose a problem for Snap in much the same way Instagram did when its own version of Stories launched,” the analyst commented.

Using social media for link building isn’t a new idea, but it’s often not utilized to its full potential. And considering it’s a much cheaper alternative compared than many other options, it makes sense to be aware of how social media can benefit your SEO process. In this post, we'll look at ways in which you can gain those precious links through social media. 1. Find niche bloggers Guest blogging is a popular way of building links. The process often goes like this: you Google people that you think might be interested in the topic, you contact them, get a permission to write a guest post on their sites, and then, finally, write one. Guest posting has a number of important benefits - Jeff Goins sums them up in his article on how to grow online audience through guest posting: Guest posting builds relationships Guest posting is great for search engines Guest posting introduces you to new people In fact, Jeff makes a point that for SEO guest posting might be five times more valuable then creating new content on your own site - so long as you get the backlink. However, guest posting isn’t a quick and simple process. Outreach often takes months, with only about 5% ending up accepting your blog post. Social media can simplify your connection strategy, and improve your chances of a positive outcome.   For this purpose, you need to use a social media monitoring tool - platforms like Awario, Brand24 and Mention all serve this purpose. Enter your industry and/or niche keywords into your tool of choice and you can find authors that have mentioned these keywords. You can then sort them hierarchically, based on the number of times they’ve mentioned the keywords or by the size of their audience (or both). This gives you a list of key influential voices you want to reach out to in your sector. Once you’ve found them, it’s all about interaction. Luckily, social media is exactly the place to do that. Connect with the bloggers you chose and then spend some time engaging with their content. Then, when you’ll finally approach them with a request to get mentioned, you'll have a much better chance to receive a positive reply. 2. Increase rankings through increased engagement Google has repeatedly stated that social shares do not influence their search rankings - but that doesn't mean social plays no part at all in the process. Social has become a key distribution channel for content, and once your content is out there and starts generating engagement via social shares, it gets traffic. And traffic is a metric that Google definitely cares about. As Lori Highby, founder of the Milwaukee-based digital agency Keystone Click, writes: “Social shares lead to increased page views, more activity on your website, comments on your blog, and more frequent mentions of your brand - and all of these indirectly increase rankings." If you’re frustrated by social media because it doesn’t seem to bring you links or traffic despite all the followers, that's probably because you have the wrong followers - go back to the influencers you identified in the previous step and work to get a similar following. For example, you can use Crowdfire to copy their followers and follow them yourself. You can also try running a competition - but the trick is to include a prize that that represents your brand perfectly and that would be interesting only to those that could potentially buy your product. Otherwise, you’ll end up with the random following again. 3. Increase brand exposure As noted, social media is a distribution channel, and it creates more buzz than any other distribution channel out there, simply due to its massive popularity. However, just being on social media isn’t enough for brand exposure - you have to work for better brand exposure on social media. This includes, firstly, creating content, and it can work particularly well if you create controversial content. It has to be able to start a debate, so it should be arguable from a several points of view. The key isn’t to present some ridiculous argument or counter narrative that goes against your brand voice - that's just controversy for controversy's sake - but posts that inspire engagement can generate significant buzz and get your business more attention, and again, traffic. You should also consider “how-to” content - you’re an expert in whatever you’re selling, and the least you can do is present this knowledge on social media. People look for advice on “how to” everything every day - cater to that demand by producing accessible, instructional and informational posts. This will present your brand as the expert in the field - and ultimately earn you exposure and links. A good tactic for brand exposure is to find out what your competitors are doing - one tool that can help with this is SEO SpyGlass. 4. Build relationships Social media is about building relationships, and it would be a shame to miss the opportunity to connect with people there. In the long term, relationships help build links and improve rankings. Your audience, the amount of ‘likes’ and ‘shares’ build social proof, which, in turn, gives credibility to your content and can make it appear more trustworthy. Building social media relationships isn’t as straightforward as it sounds - it has to be natural, personal and honest to earn you good links, as they will only come from contacts that trust you. Automating interactions might save you time, but it's not likely to bring your any results in the end. You should aim to take part in conversations about your product, answer people’s questions, share their content, and comment on what they share. Sometimes it's not necessary to portray your expertise - a simple comment such as ‘Hey, great post” can be as useful. This helps build your presence, people will start recognizing you and/or your brand in the social media circles, and will feel more compelled to share your content and check out your products. Conclusion Social media offers numerous opportunities for link building, but these opportunities are indirect. Because of this, they're normally not the top priority for SEOs. While you should certainly prioritize things like customer support and lead generation when you get to social media marketing, don’t forget that it can also help you with link building - the connection may not be as obvious, but there is definite SEO value there.  Author Information Aleh Barysevich Founder and Chief Marketing Officer @ab80 Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Samsung launched the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus and there are key differences between them. Samsung is betting most on the Galaxy S8, but is it really so different to the Galaxy S7 and or even the better buy? You might be surprised. Display - Bigger Is Indeed Better Let’s start with the big stuff - literally. By far the biggest way Samsung has differentiated the Galaxy S8 from the Galaxy S7 is its display: Galaxy S8 - 5.8-inch Super AMOLED, 1440 x 2960 pixels (570 ppi pixel density), 83.6% screen-to-body ratio, Corning Gorilla Glass 5 Galaxy S7 - 5.1-inch Super AMOLED, 1440 x 2560 pixels (577 ppi pixel density), 72.1% screen-to-body ratio, Corning Gorilla Glass 4 Yes the Galaxy S8 display is massive and now takes up over 83% of the front of the phone. Given the Galaxy S7’s 72% was class leading last year, this is a significant step forward. The new display is also slightly brighter with improved contrast making the Galaxy S8 the first smartphone receive Mobile HDR Premium certification. And Gorilla Glass 5 survives falls better than Gorilla Glass 4. So an easy win? Mostly. The caveat is out the box the Galaxy S8 runs at a lower 2220 x 1080 resolution. You can increase it manually, but the downgrade is designed to conserve battery life (more later). Interestingly with Android 7.0, Samsung also downgraded the default resolution of the Galaxy S7 to 1080p though this just lengthens its already excellent battery life. Design - Compact Masterclass Has Downsides But the real reason the Galaxy S8 display is such big news is because the phone is barely bigger than the Galaxy S7: Galaxy S8 - 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm ( 5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31-inch), 155g (5.36 oz) Galaxy S7 - 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31-inch), 152g (5.36 oz) This is a stunning accomplishment. Never before has a 5.8-inch display been considered so pocket friendly. In fact the Galaxy S8 is only 14g (0.49 oz) heavier than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. This combination of factors will sell a lot of Galaxy S8 smartphones. Yet it isn’t all good news. The smaller bezels mean the Galaxy S8 loses its physical home button. The on-screen navigation buttons which replace it are a step forward as they are now customisable (at last!), but the fingerprint sensor is bizarrely relocated to the right of the rear camera. This makes it harder to reach (especially holding the phone in your left hand) and you’re going to smudge the camera lens a lot. This isn’t the end of the word, but it’s annoying. To counter this the Galaxy S8 has both iris and facial recognition which are fast and accurate, though you will have to point the sensor at your face each time making it a more conspicuous way of unlocking the phone. Elsewhere the Galaxy S8 keeps the best qualities of the Galaxy S7: it’s still IP68 dust and water resistant allowing for full submersion in up to 1.5 metres of water for up to 30 minutes. It still supports microSD cards (up to 256GB) and gets with the times by ditching micro USB charging for the more modern USB Type-C, which is now on all major Android flagship smartphones. Initial Galaxy S8 color options aren’t particularly inspiring with just Midnight black, Orchid Grey and Arctic Silver available, but expect more to debut throughout the phone’s lifecycle. Cameras - No The Reason To Upgrade If you love smartphone cameras then Samsung’s annual upgrades are traditionally a reason to celebrate - until now. Surprising many, Samsung has simply fitted the Galaxy S7 rear camera into the Galaxy S8. Consequently you get the same 12 megapixel, f/1.7 aperture shooter with optical image stabilisation (OIS) and 4K video recording. It’s a great module which produced the second best results of 2016 (behind the Google Pixel), but it’s a surprise to see Samsung head off into 2017 with the same hardware. Instead what Samsung says is going to improve results this time around is advancements to its image processing. Its new method mimics Google’s multi-shot technique on the Pixel by combining multiple photos into a single refined image. A quick comparison I did at the launch event saw the Pixel come out on top, but it is important to remember this is not final software: That said it is clear the Galaxy S8 does not sport a revolutionary camera and there’s surely a good chance the Galaxy S7 will receive the same image processing upgrade in due course. Where the Galaxy S7 won’t catch up, however, is the front camera. Gone is its mediocre 5 megapixel camera to be replaced by an 8 megapixel module. It retains the same f/1.7 aperture and initial testing suggests this is a significant step up. Samsung has also crowbarred in Snapchat-copying filters which - while derivative - will no doubt prove popular. Performance - Incremental Improvements Like the camera, performance is also not a reason you should look to upgrade to the Galaxy S8. Shipping with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 in the US and a Exynos 8895 in Europe and Asia, Samsung says the Galaxy S8 will deliver 10% greater CPU performance and 21% greater GPU performance. This is welcome, but by comparison the Galaxy S7 had triple the gains with a 30% faster CPU and 64% faster GPU than the Galaxy S6. The Galaxy S8 also sticks with 4GB of RAM (an Asia-only variant may jump to 6GB) but this should be perfectly adequate. As for general performance, again I reserve judgement since the samples I used had pre-release software but Samsung will need to do some optimisation as the occasional moments of lag and dropped frames of animation that haunt TouchWiz were still present. Consequently where the Galaxy S8’s main performance upgrades lie is connectivity. It is the first smartphone to support Bluetooth 5.0 (2x speed, 4x range of Bluetooth 4.2) and LTE (4G) speeds up to one gigabit, though good luck finding a carrier who can max this out (and if you find one, tell me know!). Software - Exclusive Features But For How Long? As an Android purist, Samsung’s extensive customisation of Android is not to my liking but you will find several features which - for launch at least - will be exclusive to the Galaxy S8 over the Galaxy S7. The big one is Bixby. A Google Now/Google Assistant/Google Goggles hybrid which shows contextually useful information with a left swipe of the homescreen or via a dedicated (and non-remappable) button below the volume rocker. I’m not convinced this will be any more successful than S Voice in tackling Google’s impressive software, but Samsung’s plucky resolve to keep trying never seems to fade. Aside from this you’ll find Samsung Connect - a Google Home/Apple Home rival for controlling your IoT devices, and Samsung Pay (already on the Galaxy S7) which is a credible rival to Android Pay. There again you’ll also still find two app stores, two calculators, two web browsers, two mobile payment services, two clocks, etc but if you’re a Samsung smartphone user you’ll be used to/have made peace with this a long time ago. What is more disappointing is the Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0. Given Android 7.1 is a significant upgrade that’s nearly six months old, it appears Samsung will never fully resolve its promise to deliver timely Android updates. Hidden Dex-terity My assumption is that if you can afford the Galaxy S8 then you can probably afford a decent laptop/PC as well, but regardless Samsung has done something rather interesting that borrows from Microsoft’s Continuum concept and leaves the Galaxy S7 behind. Spend $150 on the DeX dock and it will turn your Galaxy S8 into a basic Chrome OS-style PC. DeX has two USB ports for a mouse and keyboard and HDMI for a monitor so when connected the Galaxy S8 launches a customised Android desktop interface complete with mouse pointer, multi-windows support and Android apps. It is also compatible with Citrix Receiver and Amazon Workspaces. For businesses this could be useful though given the Galaxy S8 cannot operate simultaneously in both desktop and smartphone modes, I do think it is probably easier to spend the DeX money on a dedicated Chromebox. Time will tell. Battery Life - The Major Concern Extensive testing will hopefully prove me wrong, but it on paper it looks like Samsung’s experience with the Galaxy Note 7 has seen it play overly safe with the Galaxy S8. The upshot is the new smartphone packs the same 3000 mAh capacity battery as the Galaxy S7, despite needing to power a significantly larger display. Displays, for those not in the know, remain the most power hungry part of any smartphone. So couple this with the fact Samsung downgraded the native resolution of the Galaxy S8 by default and alarm bells are ringing. That said Samsung deserves plaudits elsewhere. For starters the Galaxy S8’s battery should be safe thanks to the company’s new ‘8 Point Quality Check’ and improved cycle longevity means it will lose just 5% capacity after one year, compared to almost 20% with the Galaxy S7. In addition to this the Galaxy S8’s fast wired and wireless charging is even faster than the already super-quick Galaxy S7 (though Samsung hasn’t offered any concrete figures on how much), and there’s the aforementioned port upgrade from micro USB to USB Type-C. Price And Storage - Increases All Round So if the Galaxy S8 does has your interest then what can you expect to pay? More than last year: Galaxy S8 - 64GB - $750 / €799 / £689 Yes that’s a circa $100 increase on the launch price of the Galaxy S7, but you do get twice the internal storage and it is based on the faster UFS 2.1 standard. There’s also a decent pair of AKG earphones bundled which Samsung values at $99 and goes some way to mitigating the cost (unless you already have good earphones/headphones, then its just annoying). The flipside is this is a lot of money to ask if you already own a Galaxy S7, and if you don’t own either then the fact a Galaxy S7 can now be bought new for little more than half the price muddies the waters somewhat. Early Verdict Make no mistake, the Galaxy S8 is all about looks but this is no bad thing when you look as good as it does. Simply put there is no smartphone on the market right now which can match its stunning screen-to-body ratio and it opens up a new world of huge displays in compact smartphones. Kudos Samsung. And yet if you look beyond this (admittedly killer) feature and the Galaxy S8 is actually a fairly incremental update on the Galaxy S7. It has the same main camera, battery capacity, is only marginally faster, has a poorly located fingerprint sensor and the phone is unlikely to last as long as the Galaxy S7 on single charge.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Pounds Terrorists' Defense Lines with Heavy Artillery Fire before Launching Assault Deir Ezzur Battles Intensify as Syrian Army Prepares for Major Offensive Clashes Erupt in Bahrain during Protests against Activists' Death Sentence More Iraqis Displaced from Mosul Due to Fighting between Gov't Forces, ISIL Syria: Deir Hafer after Liberation Syrian Army Making Rapid Advances in Northern Hama Aleppo: Syrian Army Soldiers Patrol in Recently Liberated City of Deir Hafer Syrian People Escape Fighting between SDF & ISIL in Raqqa The Question of the Century: Who Is the Greatest Long-Term Threat to Stability in Middle East?

Employees (????) Michael BallabanYesterday 10:21am Filed to: The Morning Shift TMS Ford Blackberry 280 3 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Photo credit: Getty Images Good morning! Welcome to The Morning Shift, your roundup of the auto news you crave, all in one place every weekday morning. Here are the important stories you need to know. Advertisement 1st Gear: Blackberry, Still A Thing Long, long ago, before you were born, before anyone was alive, there was a company called “Blackberry.” Blackberry was a victim of the Phone Wars, and it was utterly crushed by the belligerents Apple and Google, its once fruitful crops plowed asunder, its hopes and dreams turned to ashes in its mouth. So it switched from making phones to making software. Advertisement Part of that move involved making automotive software for Ford, which happened way back in 2014, but now Ford is building that partnership by hiring 400 Blackberry employees wholesale, according to Bloomberg: Ford Motor Co. agreed to hire 400 employees from BlackBerry Ltd. to help develop wireless technology at the automaker, deepening an ongoing partnership between the two companies involving in-car connectivity. The shift doubles the number of connected-car engineers at Ford and will help the U.S. company build its own wireless products in-house, said BlackBerry spokeswoman Sarah McKinney. At the same time, it helps the Canadian tech company pare costs as it completes a shift to selling software instead of phones. “The move enables us to focus all our resources on the new strategy,” McKinney said.﻿ This is silly. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are fine. Google and Apple won the war. Just give it to them. Every car infotainment system is bad anyway. Stop trying to do it all in-house, car companies. Just give up. Embrace the sweet release of automotive software death. It’s easier on everyone this way. Sponsored 2nd Gear: Ford CEO Got A 19 Percent Raise How much of a raise did you get this year? Was it 19 percent? Were you already making more than $18 million? No? Weird. You must not be the Ford CEO. Huh. Too bad, says Automotive News: Advertisement His total compensation was $22.1 million, up from the $18.6 million he made in 2015, according to the company’s annual shareholder proxy statement, released Friday. That includes a $1,787,500 base salary, a $2,736,000 million cash bonus and $14,298,356 worth of long-term stock and performance-based equity awards, making the value of the compensation awarded to Fields during the year — excluding changes in pension value and other costs — $18.8 million, up 8.4 percent from the prior year.﻿ Two million of Mark Fields’ new dollars are due to a rise in the value of his pension, which Ford doesn’t really control. But Ford does control the use of Fields’ private jet, on which it spent almost $300,000. For the record, Jalopnik barely spent half that on its own private jet this year. We’ll be filing a union complaint. Advertisement 3rd Gear: The Problem With Dividing GM Shares Okay, this gets a little wonky, but bear with me. A little while back, a hedge fund guy named David Einhorn proposed separating GM stock into two classes of shares in a scheme designed to boost the company’s stock price. The thinking behind it, so it would seem, is that it would allow for two types of investors. One type of investor would be looking for short-term profits and dividends, and the other type would be in it for the long haul. Everyone would win, depending on what type of investor you are. Right? Right? Advertisement Advertisement Not so fast, Reuters says, because there’s an inherent conflict of interest there: One obstacle cited by legal and financial advisers is the probable conflict it presents for GM’s directors, who under Delaware law are required to be loyal to all shareholders. That could get tricky under Einhorn’s plan as directors would oversee two classes of stock that each have voting powers but competing ambitions for use of company capital. For instance, directors would have to square voting to raise quarterly payouts, which would exclusively benefit the dividend stock holders, versus allocating more toward capital expenditures or stock repurchases, which would benefit the growth stock camp. “It puts the board in an odd position,” said Charles Elson, a University of Delaware corporate governance professor who also sits on the board of restaurant chain Bob Evans Farms Inc (BOBE.O). “Do you plow money back into the business, or buy back the stock? You end up penalizing at least one of the stock holders. It gets messy.”﻿ Legally speaking, GM’s executives have to act in the interest of all shareholders at all times, as any company’s executives must do. This plan would create the opposite of that. Also, it’s a little weird that Einhorn would want to do it with GM, of all companies, since car companies by their very nature need to operate on relatively vast corporate timescales. Cars take a long while to develop, is what I’m saying. Advertisement GM rejected Einhorn’s proposal, but he still says he’s going to fight for it. 4th Gear: Aston Martin’s Going To Do Some Financial Re-Tooling This is a bit of a nutty concept in today’s day and age, but Aston Martin is still a (relatively) independent small car company. The number of high-end automakers that can claim that sort of independence can nominally be counted out before you run out of fingers. To stay in business, it needs to do some work with its debt, Bloomberg says: Advertisement Advertisement The U.K. luxury auto maker needs to refinance almost $600 million in debt coming due next year and is seeking to replace it with 530 million pounds in new dollar and sterling-denominated bonds. At stake is the next step of a revamp of the product range to revive sales and the company has burned cash every year since 2008, according to research firm CreditSights. Aston Martin has funded this with repeated capital raising, including a 200 million pound issue of preference shares in 2015, and the debt it’s seeking to replace — 304 million pounds of secured notes issued in 2011 and a 2014 issue of payment-in-kind notes on which $219 million is outstanding.﻿ If everything goes smoothly – which it probably will – Aston will be just fine. You’ll get your DBX. If you can afford it. 5th Gear: Change At Volkswagen Will Be Hard Advertisement Dieselgate was the result of a number of factors at Volkswagen, ranging from profits to egos to who-the-hell-knows-what, but one of those factors was the corporate culture. And in a company as vast as VW is, changing that culture will be hard, Reuters reports: VW is hamstrung by the different interests of its stakeholders - which include a powerful role for trade unions - and a lack of new leaders, he added. CEO Matthias Mueller has been with VW for nearly four decades and Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch was previously its long-term finance chief. [Volkswagen head of HR Karlheinz] Blessing said VW wanted to put an end to managers shifting accountability to others and would ensure the best qualified people were handed responsibilities - something that might not always have been the case under a top-down management style.﻿ I, for one, support full radical anarchic democracy at Volkswagen. TRULY A PEOPLE’S CAR. Reverse: TIL Knute Rockne Had A Car Named After Him Advertisement Advertisement On this day in 1931, Knute Rockne, the legendary Notre Dame football coach and namesake of the Studebaker Rockne line of autos, is killed in a plane crash near Bazaar, Kansas, at the age of 43.﻿ Neutral: Can’t Infotainment Systems Be Easier? At this point, I’m wondering why Ford or GM or Honda or BMW or whomever doesn’t just go to Google or Apple or whomever and be like “screw it, you wanna just do the whole infotainment system? Not just the phone stuff, the whole shebang. We’ll pay you money. It’s fine.” Advertisement I suspect it has something to do with pride.

The contribution is higher than it has paid in the past but critics still called the amount ‘paltry’. Experts said the US web search giant would have owed around ten times that figure if it were taxed on its total profits from sales in Britain. Google, which has office at London's Kings Cross, paid £36.4 million in UK corporation tax for the year to June 30, 2016, the company has confirmed Google’s accounts say it made £148.8million of pre-tax profits in the UK following revenues of £1billion. But the technology firm is thought to make around a tenth of its £71.2billion worldwide revenues over here – suggesting that Google actually gets around £7billion from UK operations. The discrepancy is down to the fact that business from UK customers who buy advertising space is channelled through Ireland, where Google has its European headquarters.

Share this article Share John Cullinane, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said: ‘The amount of corporation tax Google pays in the UK is not based on the amount of profit Google makes from its sales to UK customers. ‘If it were, Google would be paying about ten times as much – probably about £300million.’ He said he had no problem with the arrangement, adding: ‘There are big swings and roundabouts. That’s just how things work.’ But others were furious at Google’s contribution to Britain’s coffers. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Susan Kramer said: ‘It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes. Chancellor Philip Hammond will come under renewed pressure to raise more revenue from huge technology giants  ‘If [ministers] want to stop cutting vital services they need to start picking up what is owed to the British people. The Government seem to be letting big online businesses off the hook.’ Last year, the Government sparked fury by allowing Google to settle a decade’s worth of tax bills for £130million. The then chancellor, George Osborne, hailed it as a victory while critics slammed it as ‘derisory’. In previous years, Google had paid as little as £3.2million. A spokesman for the tech giant said yesterday: ‘As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. ‘We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in King’s Cross for 7,000 staff.’ Buried in Google’s latest accounts, the firm said HMRC actually owed it £31.5million in ‘corporation tax’. Insiders said yesterday that they did not expect to receive a cheque for the rebate. Instead it will be deducted from future tax bills. Google has always insisted it abides by tax laws but critics say its complex financial arrangements allow it to avoid taxation on billions of pounds of revenue. Such payments act as a refund for firms that have over-paid on pre-paid, estimated corporation tax bills. However, the apparent repayment has prompted fresh scepticism over Government promises to grab back the money it was due from Google. Google has fought for years to counter accusations that it makes a poor contribution to UK coffers. The company’s corporate motto is ‘do no evil’. MP Margaret Hodge famously lambasted the tech giant over its complicated tax scheme in 2013, quipping: ‘I think that you do evil.’ The £130million tax deal with the Government was supposed to draw a line under that controversy. However, the sum looked paltry next to the £1.3billion that France demanded from the technology giant. Yesterday’s disclosures are also likely to spark fresh fury over the web company’s profits from hate. The firm has been at the centre of claims it is funding extremists by placing ads from blue chip companies next to YouTube videos by IS supporters. Google insists the sums involved were ‘pennies not pounds’ but experts say some hate preachers have made tens of thousands of pounds.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google Scraps Upcoming Maps App Feature Corazon Victorino International Business TimesMarch 29, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Google updated its Google Maps app this week to add a feature that enables users to share their location information using links. However, that’s not the only change that Google did to its Maps app. It was found today that the Mountain View giant has abandoned its plan of introducing the Save Your Parking feature to the Maps app.  Android Police reports that the Google Maps 9.49 beta no longer contains the Save Your Parking feature that was supposed to manually save the user’s parking location for future reference. The unofficial feature that Google introduced in beta testing 10 days ago was intended to be a more accurate means of pinning down the user’s parking spot. It even allowed beta testers to add notes, attach photos and set the time limit for metered parking.  A server-side update that went live yesterday removed the Save Your Parking feature and replaced it with the Share Your Location functionality. Hence, when beta testers now click to view the different location options, they only see the following: See Places Near You, Share Your Location, Calibrate Blue Dot Compass and Report Blue Dot Issues.  The removal of the Save Your Parking feature obviously comes as a shock to beta testers as it offered a better means of locating parked vehicles than Google’s regular method of saving parking information. The latter relies only on estimates in determining where one could have possibly stopped driving his or her vehicle. Android Headlines also pointed out that the defunct feature had the advantage of showing notifications that users could access anytime until they made their safe return to their parked car.  Given that Google never made an official announcement about the Save Your Parking feature for the Maps app, it’s still possible that it continues to be in development. Android Police says it’s possible that the developers working on the feature may have stumbled upon a bug that prompted them to disable it temporarily as they work on a fix for it. Should this really be the case, users can expect the unofficial feature to reappear in the next beta version of Google Maps.  Google MapsMore Google has decided to scrap an upcoming Maps app feature.
