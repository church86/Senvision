Social media will play a key role in increasing accessibility to online trends, viewer engagement and data analytics during the upcoming presidential debate.   - GASTON DE CARDENAS/AFP/Getty Images The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has a new media partner — social media. The commission has announced that it will work with Facebook, Google, Snapchat and Microsoft to provide data from social media networks to the debate moderators, and to enhance viewer engagement and online research. Facebook and Google will provide analytics to the moderators in advance of the debates on trending search topics, likes, re-posts, etc. In an email, Facebook said the new effort will help provide input from more diverse voices in the political process. Analyst Jack Myers at MediaVillage agreed and said the increased involvement of social media companies in the debates is long overdue. “It’s like taking the temperature of the population,” Myers said. “Social media will give the moderators a better sense of what’s capturing public opinion among different groups.” Especially, he said, among young people — who conduct a lot of their social lives online and whose opinions are notoriously difficult to survey through traditional polling. There is a less-elevating possibility, said Princeton University political historian Julian Zelizer: “It can create a much more chaotic and ugly debate, because what’s out there in the social media’s not always pretty. So some of the questions and some of the issues that come from the public might actually diminish the quality of the debate.” For instance, Google has just launched a new site that aggregates search-topic trends for each presidential candidate. Today it reported that among the top-ranked were “Jimmy Fallon” and “Trump hair.” That was a follow on media buzz from Donald Trump’s appearance on the Tonight Show the night before, during which host Jimmy Fallon asked Trump: “Can I mess your hair up?” Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said that what generates the most social-media traffic is typically whatever the mainstream media has hyped most heavily over the past 24 hours. Recently, that might have been birtherism, Benghazi, tacos or emails. But, she said, “the economy, terrorism and health care are the top three issues when people are asked to volunteer the issues that are most important to them, that they want to hear the presidential candidates address.” Follow Mitchell Hartman at @entrepreneurguy.  Mitchell Hartman Mitchell Hartman is the senior reporter for Marketplace’s Entrepreneurship Desk and also covers employment.

Microsoft leverages Minecraft in battle for education market Backchannel This fall, Microsoft plans to weaponize Minecraft in the war for classroom mind-share by selling an education edition. It could prove an unexpected advantage in Microsoft’s increasingly fierce battle with rivals Google and, to a lesser degree, Apple over the education market. Microsoft’s Windows operating system still rules the global education market, but Google Chromebooks, which are cheaper laptops designed to run Chrome OS and primarily use online apps, have grown to dominate U.S. classrooms. In 2015, Chromebooks topped 50 percent of personal computer sales in the U.S. K-12 education market for the first time, with Windows PCs trailing at 22 percent, according to a Futuresource Consulting report. Microsoft has also been dueling with Google over education software, especially for managing and grading assignments. In April, it announced a Microsoft Classroom update to its Office 365 cloud service as a direct challenge to the Google Classroom and Google Apps for Education platforms. But a version of Minecraft tailored to K-12 classrooms could prove the truest arrow yet in Microsoft’s quiver as the tech giant aims to win over educators and students.

People play Pokemon Go at El Olivar park in San Isidro district of Lima, Peru, September 2, 2016. Credit: REUTERS/Mariana Bazo More like this New Android Trojan SpyNote leaks on underground forums This fake Pokemon Go game will secretly drive porn ad clicks Pokémon Go for iOS will stop requiring full Google account access Video Security Sessions: How to prepare for a data breach Security researchers have found a malicious application on Google Play that had over 500,000 downloads and was designed to gain complete control over Android devices. The application masqueraded as a guide for the popular Pokémon Go game and used multiple layers of obfuscation to bypass Google Play's malware detection mechanisms, researchers from Kaspersky Lab said in a blog post. The app contains a malicious module that doesn't execute immediately. Instead, the app waits for another application to be installed or uninstalled in order to determine if it's running on a real device or in an emulated environment, like the ones used to detect malware. How to respond to ransomware threats Once the app determines that it runs on a real device, it waits a further two hours before executing the malicious module, which then connects to a remote server and sends data about the device. The server can instruct the module to download exploits for local privilege escalation vulnerabilities that were discovered in Android between 2012 and 2015. These are known as root exploits because they grant access to the highest privileged account on Android -- the root account. In other words, successful exploitation will lead to a full compromise of the device. [ ALSO ON CSO: Pokemon Go: What security awareness programs should be doing now ] Google has released patches for all of these vulnerabilities, but because of the fragmentation of the Android ecosystem, there are likely many devices out there that haven't received all the updates. This doesn't mean that the 500,000 downloads represent the number of compromised devices. Android has local protection features like Verify Apps and SafetyNet that are specifically designed to detect and block known root exploits. Kaspersky identified over 6,000 successful infections, primarily in Russia, India and Indonesia. "However, since the app is oriented towards English-speaking users, people in such geographies, and more, are also likely to have been hit," the Kaspersky researchers said. The malicious “Guide for Pokémon Go” app was not the only app in the Google Play store that contained this Trojan module. Kaspersky found other such apps that were in the store at different times since December 2015. Most of the older apps had around 10,000 downloads, but one called "Digital Clock" had more than 100,000 downloads. Google has done a pretty good job at keeping malware out of its official app store over the past few years, but as this incident shows, malicious applications can still slip through from time to time.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | September 16, 2016 -- 21:08 GMT (14:08 PDT) | Topic: Google Google has acquired the two-year old startup Urban Engines to incorporate its location-based analytics into Google Maps. "Location analytics is an important focus for both Urban Engines and Google, and we're excited to combine forces to help organizations better understand how the world moves," said Urban Engines in a blog post. Google Maps has been improving and expanding its functionality, as Apple and other companies like Uber bolster their own mapping capabilities. Jen Fitzpatrick, who leads the Google Maps team, told Business Insider that they're trying to build "the richest, deepest, most detailed understanding of the real world that's ever existed". That includes incorporating the sort of rich traffic data that Urban Engines collects and analyzes. The company said it has customers across the Americas, Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. "With the rapid growth in sensors (GPS, beacons, etc.) on smartphones and cars and transit, we are now truly in the age of Internet of Moving Things," the company said in its blog post. "The potential to improve the lives of millions of commuters, by learning from commuting behavior patterns, reshaping congestion and creating new consumer services in each minute-mile is incredible."

I guess you might be able to call this case an amusing combination of both. In a screenshot grabbed by one Twitter user, it seems Google has (accidentally, probably) blurred out the face of a cow… Not long after this tweet started going viral, the puns started flowing in: “Some people think one cow looks much like any udder. Not so!” “Google teat view” “Anonymoos?” “Was she asked mooove out of the way or was the pic taken on the hoof?” As noted by another Twitter user, it’s not exactly uncommon for Google’s system to er on the side of caution and automatically blur faces that might not be faces. It’s also known to sometimes blur entire houses. So while I wouldn’t exactly put this in the category of being unlikely, it’s still amoosing.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Quality Score Update: What You Need to Know News  Paid Search September 9, 2016 News Paid Search Frederick VallaeysSeptember 9, 2016 1.2KSHARES 4.6KREADS 1.2KSHARES 4.6KREADS Frederick Vallaeys 1.2KSHARES 4.6KREADS AdWords Quality score matters because it’s one of the main factors Google uses to determine whether one of our ads is shown, what position it gets, and how much we’ll have to pay if someone clicks it. I’ve done my best over the years to shed some light on how this sometimes mysterious score is derived by Google through several blog posts, conference presentations, and webinars. AdWords Quality Score Changes Sept. 12, 2016 With an impending change in Quality Score from Google due to roll out on September 12th, 2016, I wanted to share an updated version of my free AdWords Script that helps advertisers monitor changes in their account level QS. The change from Google is that keywords with insufficient data, either new keywords or keywords with sparse recent history will now get a null QS. I think this is a useful change because it gives us cleaner data to monitor what Google really thinks about our accounts’ QS. What Changes From the 2015 QS Update This change follows last year’s QS reporting update where Google started off all new keywords at a QS of 6. Prior to that, new keywords got an estimated QS based on historical data from others who’d advertised on the same keyword in the past, as well as the advertiser’s own QS history. In effect, the advertiser’s “account-level” QS was a factor in the starting QS of new keywords. After the 2015 Quality Score update, there were many more keywords at QS 6 than before, making it hard for advertisers to see exactly what their account-level QS was. The problem with the 2015 update was that it created two possible reasons why a keyword might have a QS of 6: The keyword earned a QS of 6 based on its history The keyword had too little data and was defaulted to QS 6 You can see why that can create some confusion: it’s very hard to determine if a keyword with a QS of 6 is worth optimizing or if it might improve on its own given a bit more time. In our research at Optmyzr we concluded that after approximately 100 impressions, an ad with a QS of 6 was probably really a QS 6 keyword and not merely waiting for more data. Optmyzr’s analysis showed that after ~100 impressions, the likelihood of changing QS from getting more impressions was much lower than during the first 100 impressions. This indicates that after 100 impressions, Google is confident in assigning a true QS to a keyword. For people who were monitoring account-level QS through scripts like the one I published or tools like the Quality Score Tracker from Optmyzr (my company), the 2015 change resulted in all accounts moving closer to an account-level QS of 6. In the example shown here, an account with great QS dropped a bit because a lot of keywords with sparse data got defaulted to QS 6. After the September 2015 QS change, most accounts moved closer to QS of 6. What is Not Changing Even though keywords with not enough data will now show a QS of ‘–’, these keywords remain eligible to participate in the ad auctions so this means that they actually do have a QS. The 1-10 QS number you see in the account is merely an indication from Google about the average QS. They continue to use a real-time QS (a.k.a. Fast QS according to Mitch, a Googler on the AdWords Community) that is calculated for every single ad auction. This is the score that determines a number of important things: If the ad is eligible to appear for the query In what position the ad will appear (rank and top-of-page promotion) The actual CPC needed to beat the next competitor What extensions and other features like dynamic keyword insertion (DKI) the ad is eligible to use Free AdWords Script to Calculate Account Quality Score If you’re interested to track how the Sept 2016 change impacts your account QS, be sure to start calculating it before the change with a script like this one. By calculating the score before and after the change using the same methodology, you can get a good understanding of how the change impacts you directionally. I first published a version of this script in 2013 and have now updated it in a few important ways: It only uses QS data when the QS is a number from 1 to 10. Keywords with no QS, i.e. ‘–’ are excluded from the calculation. Because Google now uses a blend of data from mobile and desktop, I modified the script to use impressions from all device types. A few years ago when mobile was not yet dominant, Google used a more limited data set to calculate QS so that all advertisers would be on an even playing field. The script still calculates the score using only data from Google Search. This is because different ad layouts on search partners could impact the score, so Google removes this variation by excluding data from search partners.

Of course there can always be unintended consequences so when people see fewer keywords with QS 6 they may think they are doing better or worse than before and change their accounts or bids. That’s why I like to monitor things closely, especially whenever there are changes being made by Google.

We've got your back. Read More . Quick Settings — the grid of “quick tiles” that you see when you swipe down the notification shade — is now fully dynamic and customizable. Many of the tiles are more functional than they were, you can reorder or remove them altogether, and you can even add new tiles from third-party developers. We’ll step you through everything you need to know about the new Quick Settings, and stayed tuned until the end to learn about some of the best new Quick Settings apps out there. Customize the Quick Settings Panel Swiping down once from the top of your phone’s screen shows your notifications as well as a quick access bar containing the first five tiles in your Quick Settings panel. Swiping down a second time opens the full panel. This is paginated, with nine tiles per page. You can also open this instantly by swiping down with two fingers. Ads by Google When you’re customizing the panel, the trick is to get your most-used tiles on the first page. Tap the Edit button in the bottom right to get started. Adding, removing, and reordering quick tiles is as simple as dragging and dropping them into place. Hold your finger down on the tile for a second, then drag it to wherever you want it. The first five tiles make up your quick access bar. You should put the tiles you use most — like Wi-Fi, battery, or flashlight — here. The first nine tiles in the list will appear in the first page. Tiles that are available but currently unused can be found in the bottom half of the screen, under the Drag to add tiles label. To add a tile, drag it up to the top half of the screen. To remove a tile, you drag it down into the bottom half of the screen. Quick Settings Shortcuts The functionality of the quick tiles has definitely been boosted in Nougat. Most of them now accept both a tap and a long-press.

Download — Searchly (Free) on the Play Store 4. Caffeinate Configuring your phone’s screen to turn off after 30 seconds is an important way of eking out a bit more battery. It’s really inconvenient, though, when you’re actually using your phone but just not touching the screen, like when you’re reading a long document, or following a recipe. Caffeinate solves the problem by keeping your screen awake for five minutes after you tap it. Download — Caffeinate (Free) on the Play Store 5. QuickTile QuickTile is like a Quick Settings version of the Tasker app. It enables you to group together several functions and activate them all with the single tap of a tile. For example, you could launch a video player, and increase the volume and screen brightness all at the same time. Or you could launch your Twitter client straight into the Compose Tweet screen. With some experimental root options in the works, this could become a very powerful app. Download — QuickTile (Free) on the Play Store 6. Ringer Modes If you only download one of these quick tile apps, Ringer Modes should be it. It could not be more simple or more effective. It switches your phone’s ringer between Normal, Silent, and Vibrate. Why this wasn’t a part of Nougat to begin with, we’ll never know. Download — Ringer Modes (Free) on the Play Store 7.

Tiles The only fully paid app in this list is also the most polished and impressive. Tiles collects together many of the features of the individual apps we’ve looked at and more into a single tool. There are 16 feature categories in total, and you can activate or deactivate each one so they don’t clutter up your Quick Settings edit screen. With Tiles, you can launch individual apps or view an app launcher, make calls, compose emails, set a timer, or see the weather. You can also control many of your phone’s settings, like adjusting the brightness, controlling the volume, or locking the screen. There’s so much here to play with — this is already one of Nougat’s best apps. Download — Tiles ($1.49) on the Play Store Your Favorite Apps? As more devices start to get Nougat, we can expect to see a growing number of Quick Settings apps, and in some cases, we might even see support being integrated into existing apps. It’s a really powerful feature with a lot of potential. Have you found any good quick tile apps? And what features would you most like to see added to the Quick Settings panel?

The FBI Warns You to Cover Your Webcams You probably know someone who covers their webcam when they’re not using it. You may in the past have asked them why they do it. And when they told you it was to stop people spying on them you probably thought they were just being a little bit paranoid. But it turns out they may be the sensible ones after all. Why? Because even James Comey, the Director of the FBI (Federal Bureau of Intelligence), covers his webcams. And if the man in charge of the Feds is doing it, then you sure as hell should be doing it too. According to The Hill, Comey was recently asked, “Do you still have a piece of tape over your cameras at home?” To which he replied, “Heck yeah, heck yeah. You go into any government office and we all have the little camera things that sit on top of the screen,” he added. “They all have a little lid that closes down on them. You do that so that people who don’t have authority don’t look at you. I think that’s a good thing”.

Nonsense that really should get them unfriended, by you, immediately. Do your friends do these things? It might be time. Read More . But there is now a legitimate reason to stop doing this, beyond just the desire not to bore your friends and family with pictures of your odious offspring. An 18-year-old woman from Austria is currently suing her parents over the embarrassing photos of her they shared on Facebook. She claims it’s an invasion of her privacy, especially as they didn’t seek her permission before posting them. Which, to be fair, is rather tricky when you’re talking about a toddler. The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, told The Local, “They knew no shame and no limit. They didn’t care whether it was a picture of me sitting on the toilet or lying naked in my cot — every stage was photographed and then made public. I’m tired of not being taken seriously by my parents”. So, there’s something to think about the next time you’re poised to post endless pictures of your kids online without their prior knowledge. Lenovo Wants You to Skip the Sevens Faced with stiff competition in the smartphone department, Lenovo is coming out fighting. While Apple and Samsung make all the headlines, Lenovo reckons its handsets are actually better. But how to convince the general population that there’s life beyond the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7? A campaign headlined “Skip the Sevens,” that’s how. There are full-page ads in newspapers, and a series of video ads showing just what the Moto Z has to offer over and above the “Sevens” currently on sale. Lenovo maintains the people in this focus group are real too. If you can believe it. The Moto Z does indeed have a lot to offer. The Moto Mods, which are basically snap-on covers which upgrade the handset in some way, are especially cool.

Apart from being fugly, there’s just one problem with the Apple AirPods. As Conan O’Brien wryly observes in this mocking take on the old iPod ads… The fact is you are going to lose your new AirPods at some point. Whether down the loo, down a drain, or under people’s feet. Or maybe you’ll have them snatched out of your ears in a new style mugging. Regardless, Apple will be more than happy to sell you some replacements. And more replacements. And more replacements.

Allow me, for just one moment, to channel my inner Jimmy McMillan and state that the cost of VR tech is too damn high. Let’s do the math together. An HTC Vive Virtual Reality is Finally Here: HTC Vive Review (& Giveaway) Virtual Reality is Finally Here: HTC Vive Review (& Giveaway) The HTC Vive for Steam VR redefines gaming, and more besides. It's the closest thing to a Holodeck I've ever seen. And it's absolutely incredible. Read More costs about $799 while an Oculus Rift Oculus Rift Review and Giveaway Oculus Rift Review and Giveaway Virtual Reality is not new, but it's finally affordable and within our grasp. After four year and two development prototypes, the final consumer edition of the Oculus Rift has arrived. Read More will set you back slightly less at $599. Then you need to get a sufficiently powerful computer with a dedicated graphics card to run it all with reasonable performance — this could cost you another $800 or more if you buy said computer off the shelf. Then you need some software to run on it. At the time of writing, the current top-selling VR game on Steam is Redout, which costs $35. Add it all together and you’re looking at an initial cost of somewhere between $1500 and $2000 just to start playing one game. But what about the so-called “cheap options,” namely Google Cardboard Meet Google's Next-Generation Virtual Reality Platform Meet Google's Next-Generation Virtual Reality Platform Read More and Samsung Gear VR Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and Gear VR Review and Giveaway Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and Gear VR Review and Giveaway Samsung sells more Android devices than any other manufacturer, and thanks to some aggressive marketing, the Galaxy brand is almost synonymous with Android. Read More ? Well, true. These headsets are far cheaper, but they’re still not cheap. They require the user to have a specific model of smartphone — almost always a mid-to-high-end one. But soon — well, at some point in 2017 — prices are going to crash, and it’s all because of a company you may not know much about, at least in the realm of VR: Qualcomm. The Smartphone Model Qualcomm is one of the biggest manufacturers of smartphone SoCs (System on Chips Jargon Buster: The Guide to Understanding Mobile Processors Jargon Buster: The Guide to Understanding Mobile Processors In this guide, we'll cut through the jargon to explain what you need to know about smartphone processors. Read More ) in the world. Ads by Google Based in San Diego, with offices in virtually every continent, the company employs over 33,000 people and pulls in over $25 billion in annual revenue. You might be familiar with its ubiquitous Snapdragon line of processors, which can be found on devices from manufacturers as diverse as HTC, Motorola, Samsung, Sharp, and Sony. One of the tactics Qualcomm has effectively used in its quest for mobile dominance is its Reference Design program. In short, these are fully-featured smartphones that contain Snapdragon silicon on the inside — the “gotcha” is that they’re not intended for consumers. Rather, third-party smartphone manufacturers (called OEMs, or Original Equipment Manufacturers) use them as the basis for their own devices. The fundamentals of the phone are there, but manufacturers can make small tweaks, such as change the display or upgrade the camera, in order to differentiate the handset from other smartphones based on the same reference. Reference Design devices are awesome because they allow manufacturers to save significant sums of money in research and development (R&D). This means that smartphone production is cheaper in the long run and thus results in lower prices for consumers. I should note that Qualcomm isn’t the only chip manufacturer with a reference design program. MediaTek, Intel, and BroadComm have all pursued something similar before. So, What’s This Got to Do With VR? It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Qualcomm is using the lessons it learned from the smartphone business and applying them to the promising world of virtual reality. The VR820 is its effort in this space. As the name suggests, it’s based on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 chipset, which is found in a range of kick-ass smartphones, including but not limited to: the LG G5, the Samsung S7 and S7 Edge, the HP Elite X3, and the Xiaomi Mi5 Pro. Unlike the Vive and the Rift, the VR820 is a standalone device, meaning you don’t need to be tethered to a computer for it to work. All of the magic happens on the device itself. And as you’d expect, it ticks all the boxes you’d expect from a high-end VR device. It has integrated eye-tracking with two cameras, motion-to-photon latency under 18ms, dual front-facing cameras for six degrees of freedom and see-through applications, four microphones, and sensors for a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer. But this counts for nothing if the display is grainy and dull. Thankfully, it isn’t. In fact, it’s better than those found on the Vive and Rift, with a 1440 x 1440 resolution for each eye. (Indeed, the Vive and Rift both have 1080 x 1200 displays.) It’s worth pointing out that the refresh rate, which is vital when it comes to creating an immersive virtual reality experience, is nowhere near as good as that on the aforementioned devices: 70Hz compared with 90Hz. Like the aforementioned Reference Designs, this VR reference won’t be the final product seen by individual customers. Rather, it’ll be bought by other manufacturers and be used as the basis for their own upcoming VR devices — it will spawn an algal bloom of headsets, all different in their own ways yet still with the same origins. How Much Will It Cost? Let’s recap. Reference designs are essentially blueprints that allow third-party manufacturers to save costs on R&D. These savings get passed on to consumers further down the line. In 2013, Qualcomm said that over 40 OEMs had used its reference designs to build 170 different smartphones, mostly for the Chinese market, but also for consumers in India, Brazil, Taiwan, and Vietnam. So, what kind of impact with Qualcomm’s reference designs have on the price of VR headsets? This remains to be seen. The company has been tight-lipped about specifics, but speaking to The Verge, it said that it expects one of these headsets to cost the same as a “higher-performance tablet”. This is purposefully vague, but one can interpret this to mean between $300 and $500 given the current market. What This Means for Us The Qualcomm VR820 is exciting for two really huge reasons. Firstly, it’s going to cause a proliferation of all-in-one VR headsets that don’t suck. With the exception of the refresh rate, which I admit is a huge downside, it has the same specifications of other high-end headsets. In some cases, it utterly bests those from HTC and Oculus. Secondly, it’s going to make VR affordable. Small-time manufacturers are going to take Qualcomm’s reference design and will run with it. They will create models that are cheaper than those produced by the incumbents. But I don’t think that it’s going to be a downhill battle for Qualcomm. Not by a long shot. Smartphones are an easy sell. Almost everyone has one and many people replace them once a year, as they break or as more enticing models are released. But VR headsets are a niche device, and for many the value proposition isn’t immediately obvious. Qualcomm may struggle to stir the enthusiasm of its OEM partners. Are you thinking of getting a VR headset, or are you still very much a skeptic? If so, will you be waiting for one of the VR820 derivatives, or are you going to get an Oculus or Vive?

If all the processing is in the headset, it's just a more expensive Google cardboard. The Vive is for people who want to be immersed in real games, so until that headset can run Doom 2016 on it, it's old tech. Reply David September 18, 2016 at 2:41 am I am going to wait for the Oculus or Vive. The eyes are the windows to the world. Refresh rates above 60 fps is the way to go so that we do not get motion sickness. People that cannot afford $500 cell phones, don't purchase them. They will have sales and coupons for the Oculus or Vive or they will not be affordable. But they will sell. Reply Pedro Picado September 17, 2016 at 5:00 pm This makes perfect sense. And since I'm more in the "poor spectrum" of society, I'm all in for waiting till the prices drop. Reply Some Fool Online September 17, 2016 at 3:20 pm Going to get CMOAR when it comes out. Not even remotely interested in the Rift, Vive, or any other including this, given the price point and features offered by CMOAR's VR. Reply Jonathan vlietstra September 18, 2016 at 2:35 pm Then you just want to be able to look around at cool stuff in VR. While that's ok, it seems expensive for something that will get boring fast. Room scale is real VR, and you need a system that connects to a computer if you want to play games. So right now, the only real VR solution if you want to play a game in VR is the Vive. Reply Tp September 17, 2016 at 2:49 pm Good write-up .. however your are forgetting the one most important thing that will make or break VR. The very same thing that broke it back in the 90's. 3rd party software man .. this thing sounds great but without good software it's a paper weight. Will it support Google's new daydream? Apple products? I hope it does well I really do. I hope we get to a point where vr is accessible to everyone. Reply Stuza September 17, 2016 at 5:24 am Screen door effect is still significant on an S7 which is much higher PPI than PC based systems. Until the SDE is negated, im not buying a PC based one. These systems proposed by Qualcom won't have the GFX/CPU power to kick around PC equivalent games so won't be buying these either. Reply Mike September 17, 2016 at 3:49 am Very interesting, but your calculation of cost at the beginning is deeply flawed. The Rift and the Vive are aimed at gamers, and gamers already have gaming PC's. Adding the cost of the PC is wrong, like adding the cost of a car purchase to the calculation of going on a road trip. Reply Jaron September 17, 2016 at 2:25 pm Although, most of gamers aren't made out of money. I bought a gtx 760 right before specs were being released for the graphics card requirements. That broke the bank for me. Right now I would have to spend $1000 to use the vive and then I would have to find the room to use it. Everything is priced too high currently, that's why their sales numbers are so low. Reply bork September 21, 2016 at 2:09 pm They might be aimed at gamers now, but gamers have always been the group that are early adopters willing to dump big bucks into tech that the masses wouldn't even consider. Once the masses get a real taste of VR, look out. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

In this article, you’ll find recommendations for the best mobile music streaming apps, backed by an awesome collection of running music. What Is Running Music? Not everyone loves the same kind of music, and not everyone is inspired by the same songs. So what makes certain music better for running? It is, in essence, whatever makes your heart start pounding.

We’re here to find the kind of music that’ll inspire you to get off the couch and immerse yourself in the running experience. Not all mobile streaming music apps will give you that experience, but let’s take a look at all of your options. Ads by Google Pandora: Victim to Someone Else’s Whims The nice thing about Pandora is that it’s free. The Pandora app is available from either Google Play or the iTunes App Store. It takes no effort to start listening to music Improve Pandora With These Chrome & Firefox Browser Add-Ons Improve Pandora With These Chrome & Firefox Browser Add-Ons With over 35 million listeners, Pandora is easily one of the most popular Internet radio sites.

You just create a new station, type in a genre or artist, and it creates a streaming music station tuned exactly to the kind of music you’re looking for. The problem is, if you try searching for “running” music, you’ll find that those kind of stations are in short supply. Pandora search is primarily artist- and genre-based, rather than activity-based. Unless you know of specific artists or an overall genre that you love to run to, Pandora is going to struggle to fulfill your needs. Google Play Music: Dedicated Running Stations Google Play Music (also available from iTunes) is a music streaming app I discovered once by accident when searching around for some new music streaming apps to try out. I didn’t realize Google offered a dedicated free music streaming service until I stumbled upon it while checking to see how much it would cost to download individual songs. On Google Play Music The Best Music Player On Android: Google Play Music Reviewed The Best Music Player On Android: Google Play Music Reviewed One of the best things about Android is the diversity of apps, but sometimes the best apps are those produced by Google. Read More you’ll discover a “Working Out” genre all pre-programmed with energetic and motivational tunes to get you going at the gym or running on the trail. The “Working Out” section has a dedicated “Running” section. The “Running” section has a limited selection of stations filled with music. Based on the chosen song selections, the folks at Google seem to lean a bit more toward hip-hop, rap, and general pop music for running inspiration. Don’t get me wrong, the songs are great and the music will help you grind through your 5k run with little effort. You may just find that you’re running out of new music to listen to if you use Google Play Music often. Like Pandora, a drawback of Google Play Music, is that you’re streaming music over your cellular data plan. One bonus here is you can opt to go “premium” for $9.99 per month. Our advice is to download music Listen To Your Favorite Radio Stations Offline On Google Play Music Listen To Your Favorite Radio Stations Offline On Google Play Music In the latest update, the Google Play Music app for Android lets you listen to any streaming radio station offline. With offline caching you can download a radio station for listening anywhere. Read More , or entire stations, before you step out of the door. That will save a lot of bandwidth.

Here Are 6 Things You Need to Know Buying Wireless Headphones? Here Are 6 Things You Need to Know In this guide, we'll take a look at some of the most important things you need to know about wireless headphones. Read More that I truly experienced what an inspirational run can feel like. When you search Spotify for “running” you’ll discover all sorts of playlists covering a whole variety of music styles and interests. There are even running playlists organized into “type” of run like “Spring Run,” “Gym Beats,” “Winter Run,” and much more. The only thing better than having a nearly unlimited collection of running music at your disposal is the ability to listen to as much as you want offline. This is all thanks to Spotify Premium, which enables you t0 download as many tracks as you like for offline listening. This way you can go for a run deep into the woods without a cellular signal, and still listen to your rocking beats. It’s a beautiful thing. Slacker Radio: No Better Than Pandora The Slacker Radio app (from Google Play or iTunes) is another option if you’re looking for an quick app to stream music, especially if you’re at the gym where there’s an available Wi-Fi signal. You’ll discover quickly that the selection at Slacker Radio is just as limited as that at Pandora. It isn’t that Slacker is lacking in music that’s great for running, it’s just that the music isn’t organized into playlists or stations that make it easy to find and play. If you already have the Slacker app on your phone and you’re at the gym looking for quick musical inspiration, you can find it with Slacker. You will have to search for individual tracks to keep yourself motivated on the treadmill 10 Accessories Every Standing Desk Owner Should Have 10 Accessories Every Standing Desk Owner Should Have Whether you are planning to buy or build your own standing desk, or if you already have one, a standing desk isn't the only thing you need to improve your health in the office.

But if you run a lot and don’t really care about anything other than running, you might prefer the RockMyRun app. RockMyRun (available from Google Play and the iTunes App Store) is all about adding tunes to your run, and it does it better than probably any other app on the market. With a library of thousands of great songs, you’ll never run out of inspiration. You can choose which genre of music you’re interested in, or you can select the type of activity you’re doing, like burning time on an elliptical or running a marathon Train for a Half Marathon with These Running Websites & Tools Train for a Half Marathon with These Running Websites & Tools Read More . In the first case you can stick to the type of music you know you love. In the second case you can just let the app give you tunes that are perfect for that activity. It isn’t entirely just about music though. The app is intended to help you integrate music with your workout. It does that through a unique step-matching feature. This is where the app will let you choose music at a tempo that matches your running cadence. Or, you can adjust your cadence to match the beat of the music. In either case, it helps you maintain a steady pace. This is better for your breathing as well as your endurance. Run! Run Like the Wind! Now that you have a library of great streaming music apps to choose from for your run, why not get on some running gear and head out on the trail? There is nothing quite as energizing and motivating as a 20-minute jog listening to the music that you love. Why not give the apps listed above a try and let us know which one you liked using most while running.

NEW DELHI: Apple and Google may have concerns about making phones Aadhaar-ready, but top local brands seem to be game for embedding a technology that will allow users to authenticate their identity with a mere look at the phone. Micromax, Intex, Lava and Reliance Retail's Lyf have started discussions with Delta ID Inc to explore using its iris-reading technology to make their phones Aadhaar-enabled, Salil Prabhakar, chief executive of the US-based company, told ET. Some Chinese smartphone makers, too, are likely to be interested, Prabhakar said. ET was the first to report on July 29 that the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) had a meeting with leading smartphone manufacturers, asking them to consider making their phones Aadhaar-enabled so that people can authenticate their Aadhaar biometrics on the phone itself to avail of various services. Apple and Google are likely to resist the idea of opening up their system to allow embedding such a technology, because of privacy and hacking concerns, people familiar with the discussions told ET. Delta ID specializes in ActiveIRIS technology and is among the first to pass India's STQC Performance testing of integrated mobile devices used for Aadhaar authentication. Prabhakar said his company was in an "advanced stage of talks" with four companies. "We are having discussions with Reliance, Intex, Lava and Micromax. We believe Chinese brands like Gionee, Vivo and Oppo would also be interested in such an IRiS-based software for Aadhaar-based authentication," he said. "There is huge interest across the board for it. With Aadhaar enrolment in India crossing 105 crore, the potential is immense." The technology would enable a user to authenticate his Aadhaar details by looking at a phone having a special IRIS camera and LeD. Micromax, Lava and Lyf didn't comment on discussions with the technology provider. Intex Technologies said the talks were on. "ActiveIRIS is a powerful biometric identifier and this can be a game-changing feature in phones helping establish the identity of a person. At Intex, we are in talks with UIDAI and are evaluating the same," said Director Keshav Bansal. UIDAI has certified some other companies as well for iris scan authentication. These include US-based IriTech, which will assemble and market its iris scanner in India through partner Biometronic Technology, and Gujarat-based Biomatiques Identification Solutions. "We are working with InFocus on a smartphone platform and will be launching it soon," Prabhu Sridharan, the executive vice-president at IriTech, told ET. InFocus is an American phone maker, whose phones are made by Foxconn in India. Biomatiques didn't respond to an email request for comment from ET. Iris recognition uses camera technology with subtle infrared illumination to acquire images of the detail-rich, intricate structures of the iris. Digital templates encoded from these patterns by mathematical and statistical algorithms allow unique identification of an individual. Both irises are captured to form an iris template, which ranges from type 1to 7 capturing high-resolution images of irides of the eye. "This is a much better authentication biometric than a fingerprint and can be used for a larger section of population. Fingerprints are weak in case of those doing intensive manual jobs, like of farmers, construction workers, fishermen, older people, musicians, etc. Active IRiS technology is cheaper, smaller (in context of mobile phones) and convenient," the Delta ID CEO said. IriTech's Sridharan said the company had deployed its current discrete device, IriShield, on tablets used in projects such as PDS, MGNREGS, BFSI, Telecom, government time & attendances, pension and passport issuances. On July 27, Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO of UIDAI, had met senior executives of Apple, Samsung, Google, Microsoft, Micromax and product software think tank iSprit to discuss ways to make handsets Aadhaar-enabled. Samsung is the only phone maker to have already embedded the technology — Delta ID's ActiveIRIS. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Andrea Peterson September 16 Follow @kansasalps An infographic explains how flagging works on YouTube. (YouTube) YouTube says more than 90 million people have helped it flag potentially problematic videos since 2006 — more people than the entire population of Egypt. That's just one statistic that the Google-owned video site revealed in a Thursday blog post about the importance of community moderation, as social media sites grapple with trying to balance free speech and potentially harmful content. Google's streaming video service has the same problem as many other social media sites: Users submit so much content that companies say it's impossible to screen it all for postings that are illegal or offensive, or violate a site’s rules in other ways. In YouTube's case, it says users upload 400 hours of video per minute — the equivalent of 100 copies of “Gone With the Wind.” [Puddles, bird feeders, rural intersections: How live streams of nothing became online obsessions] That fire hose of content is why YouTube, along with many other sites, ask users to help them by flagging videos that violate their rules. Many have answered that call. Users from 196 countries have flagged videos for YouTube, with one-third of those users reporting more than one video, YouTube head of public policy Juniper Downs wrote in the blog post. She also said “the number of flags per day is up over 25 percent year-on-year.” Reporting a video, however, doesn’t mean it gets taken down. First, it starts a more formal review process. Clicking on the flag button, which is accessible by selecting the “More” option below a YouTube video, will pull up a form that asks a viewer to tell YouTube why they are reporting the video. The form lets users choose reasons ranging from things like sexual content and child abuse to spam. A YouTube employee then reviews the video. [Why YouTubers are accusing the site of rampant ‘censorship’] “We have trained teams, fluent in multiple languages, who carefully evaluate your flags 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year in time-zones around the world,” Downs wrote. “They remove content that violates our terms, age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences, and are careful to leave content up if it hasn’t crossed the line.” YouTube declined to comment on how many people are part of those teams, exactly how many languages they speak or where the majority of the workers are based. Social media sites often walk a "delicate line" with moderation, said University of Washington law professor Ryan Calo. "The key thing to understand is that a platform like YouTube makes their decisions against the backdrop of our free speech principles and culture, but they are not bound by those principles," he said. A  site's own policies typically take precedence. Those policies, however, can be subject to interpretation. For instance, Facebook recently reinstated and apologized for removing posts of a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo from the Vietnam War that shows a naked girl screaming and running from a napalm attack. [Protecting your kids online takes a lot more than tracking their devices] The photo, called “Terror of War,” was initially removed when Facebook's review process deemed it child porn. The action prompted protests in Norway and elsewhere. “Sometimes, though, the global and historical importance of a photo like 'Terror of War' outweighs the importance of keeping nudity off Facebook,” Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a letter to Norway’s prime minister. Online recruiting by groups like the Islamic State — including through YouTube videos — have also put security issues in the hands of social media moderators. In an interview with The Washington Post last year, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin said tech companies were being “exploited” by terror groups and that they needed to do more to fight back. Representatives from tech companies including Facebook, Google and Twitter attended a White House summit on how to block the spread of ISIS propaganda online. In the blog post Thursday, Downs said that YouTube is “vigilant and fast in removing terrorist content and hate speech,” but that those violations only represent 1 percent of the 92 million videos the site removed in 2015. She also encouraged users to “continue flagging.” business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Register Now Advertise Gmail Finally Supports Responsive Design by Jess Nelson, September 16, 2016, 3:18 PM Recommend (7) Google’s Gmail email applications will begin supporting responsive email design by the end of the month, the technology giant announced on Wednesday.   Designed emails will now render correctly on any device that email subscribers access their Gmail on, meaning that mobile users will now have the same experience that desktop users do.   “Text, links, and even buttons will enlarge to make reading and tapping easier on a smaller screen,” writes Pierce Vollucci, product manager at Gmail, on the company’s blog. “If you’re on desktop, you’ll also see improvements, since emails designed for mobile can also adapt to fit larger screens.” Google’s announcement took stage front and center at The Email Design Conference (TEDC) in San Francisco, an email marketing and development conference hosted by email testing and analytics company Litmus. “This is the most ground-breaking development for email rendering ever in the industry,” says Kevin Mandeville, content designer at Litmus. Mandeville discussed the implications of the news on email design in a conversation with Email Marketing Daily. Mandeville emphasizes how much time developers have now saved, and how that time can be expended on more creative designs and projects. Before, he says that designers would have needed to send several hours per every single email that had multiple columns. When you stack testing and troubleshooting on top of that, it's self-evident that Gmail was becoming a big, time-consuming headache for email designers. “This allows us to focus more on the creative, creating a great experience for the end subscriber with out being bogged down in the design process,” says Mandeville. “It will make responsive design more accessible to more people building emails and give a better result for the end-user -- a nice, gorgeous, mobile-friendly design when they are in Gmail.  Justin Khoo, email developer at Email on Acid, also praised Google’s decision to incorporate responsive design in its family of email products, which includes the mobile application Inbox. He says it will be a “dramatic improvement” to email design. Google’s email update, expected by the end of the month, is a critical addition for email marketers looking to engage with mobile users. The ratio of mobile to desktop clicks over the past year has changed rapidly, with mobile growing by 15% since 2015 according to Yes Lifecycle Marketing’s latest email benchmark report. Revenue driven by mobile emails also jumped 32% year-over-year and 80% over the past two years, according to the study.       119 SHARES Tags: email, google Recommend (7) Print RSS All content published by MediaPost is determined by our editors 100% in the interest of our readers ... independent of advertising, sponsorships or other considerations.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Steven Overly September 15 Follow @stevenoverly Lonnie Bunch, founding director for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, gives us an idea on what to expect when stepping inside the newest addition to the Smithsonian Institution. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post) Lonnie G. Bunch III traveled to Google’s Mountain View, Calif., headquarters a little more than a year ago to meet with leaders of the Black Googler Network, an employee group. The director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which was then under construction, wanted to tap their technical expertise. “He made the simple request: ‘However you can, help me make this museum redefine what it means to be a museum in the modern age and be at the cusp of innovation,'” said Travis McPhail, a Google Maps software engineer. McPhail was inspired. Google employees have since been developing interactive-display technology that will allow visitors to examine artifacts from all angles using 3-D scans that they access through their smartphone’s Web browser. Their phone will also serve up relevant multimedia content, such as text or video, that better explains the artifacts and their significance to African American history. McPhail said that the technology aims to solve a persistent challenge for museums: only a fraction of their artifacts are on display at any one time. Historic objects must be specially handled and maintained, making it difficult for the museum to put out too many at once. There is also finite physical space. The technology eliminates those limitations. “I thought we should be able to add tech to this story and scale up the number of artifacts that would tell a historical story,” McPhail said. “We should be able to do that in a way where visitors really can get a sense of how these objects played a part in history.” The African America history museum is set to open Sept. 24, but the Google display is not expected until next spring. Representatives from the museum did not respond to a request for comment. This isn’t Google’s first museum project. The Google Cultural Institute works with museums and historic sites to integrate interactive technology into their exhibits and enhance the experience for visitors and reach those who may not be able to travel to a physical location. Earlier this week, the company unveiled an online exhibit called Natural History that uses virtual reality, online video and photos about dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures to bring “an extinct world back to life.” Read more from The Washington Post’s Innovations section Read more Washington Post coverage of the National Museum of African American History and Culture African American museum is far from finished 10 days before opening The African American Museum tells powerful stories — but not as powerfully as it could The story behind the design of the African American history museum business on-innovations innovations Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Guide Downloaders Get Malware by Josh Kirschner on September 16, 2016 in News, Phones and Mobile, Mobile Apps, Android Apps, Computer Safety & Support, Blog :: 1 comment Image courtesy Kaspersky Security firm Kaspersky reports that downloaders of a popular Pokémon Go! guide app from the Google Play app store may have been exposed to serious malware. The app, "Guide for Pokémon Go New" by Markersel (since removed from the Play store), was downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to statistics from Google. The app provided no useful advice to Pokémon fans. Instead, it was merely a ruse to install a malicious trojan that is capable of seizing root access to your Android device, disabling installed apps and displaying unwanted ads. And because the trojan was able to acquire root access, downloaders of the app face even greater threats. Roman Unuchek, Senior Malware Analyst, Kaspersky Lab says, “Victims of this Trojan may, at least at first, not even notice the increase in annoying and disruptive advertising, but the long term implications of infection could be far more sinister. If you’ve been hit, then someone else is inside your phone and has control over the OS and everything you do and store on it." Demonstrating the sophistication in the malware's development, the trojan also has unusual features to help it bypass detection. Kaspersky reports that malware doesn’t start as soon as the victim launches the app. Instead, it waits another two hours before starting its malicious activity, making it less suspicious to malware detection. More information about the specifics of the app infection process is available from Kaspersky's Secure List blog.  The Guide for Pokemon Go malware is a reminder that downloading apps from unknown publishers can be risky, even in the Google Play Store. Kaspersky says that at least nine other apps with this same trojan were available in the Google Play Store since December of 2015. It's best to stick with well-known apps and publishers, whenever possible. And make sure you have a solid antimalware app running on your device at all times. Many computer antimalware solutions provide mobile protection as part of the subscription (including our Top Pick, which happens to be Kaspersky), or go with a standalone mobile option, such as Lookout Security.

Installers for Google Fiber confer while working in 2013, in the Piper area of northwest Kansas City, Kansas. Keith Myers MCT i By Jonathan M. Alexander jalexander@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story GARNER Google Fiber has shown progress in implementing its super-fast internet service that can reach speeds fast enough to download an high-definition movie in 40 seconds. Just Tuesday it turned on its service for the residents and small businesses in Morrisville. But it raised the question of when other municipalities, including Garner, might reap the benefits of the high-speed internet and bundle television packages that Google Fiber offers. Garner was among six municipalities who will get Google Fiber in its town limits. Others included Raleigh, Durham, Cary, Chapel Hill and Morrisville. But Google officials have not been saying much, and efforts to reach them Tuesday and Wednesday were unsuccessful. Since its initial announcement 19 months ago that Google Fiber would make its way to the Triangle, Google officials have been tight lipped about details of the company’s plan. Town officials say they don’t know anything either. “No lines installed in Garner nor have they given any indication of start time,” Town Manager Rodney Dickerson said in an email. In order to turn on the service, a Fiber Hut must first be installed. Then Google service men will dig into the ground and install the fiber optic cables. Morrisville Mayor Mark Stohlman said those two steps took a little more than year to complete in Morrisville. Earlier this year, Garner town officials signed an agreement with Google to approve a site on Spring Road for its central command center, where the fiber hut will be located. However, it doesn’t appear that construction has started on the hut. One hut can provide service to as many as 20,000 homes. The Google fiber huts are 28 feet long and 9 feet tall, and are the backbone for the service. Still, there hasn’t been indication of a time frame or schedule of when the next service will begin. Google Fiber’s arrival in Morrisville could spur competition among other service providers. For years, Time Warner Cable has dominated the market. Google offers residential customers speeds of 1,000 megabits per second for $70 a month. AT&T offers the same speed at the same price. AT&T has already installed fiber throughout the town, but it has not yet been activated in households. It is, however, active at Greenfield Business Park, Dickerson said. Time Warner Cable offers speeds of up to 300 mbps for $64 a month. Morrisville residents and small businesses can now sign up online or by phone for a handful of Google Fiber services, including internet, television and phone. Jonathan M.

Call us conspiracy theorists. But admit it, the timing of Microsoft and Google's email upgrades sometimes feel a bit suspicious, as if both companies keep new email features at the ready in case their competitor makes an announcement. This week was no exception.  On Wednesday, Google announced an improved mobile experience for Gmail and Inbox. Microsoft followed up on Thursday with its announcement of Google Drive support for Outlook.com users.  Coincidence? We'll let you decide. Inbox and Gmail Get Responsive Google’s upgrades aim to make its Inbox experience better on mobile devices, particularly smartphones. In a blog post about the upgrades, Pierce Vollucci, product manager at Google discussed the issues that arise when reading email — most of which is still formatted for a computer — on mobile. Later this month, Gmail and Inbox by Gmail will support emails created with responsive design, marking an end to wonky rendering on different screens. Text, links and buttons will enlarge to make reading and tapping easier on a smaller screen. The improvements carry over to desktops, as emails designed for mobile will also adapt to fit larger screens. While an apparently minor release, the focus is to increase email accessibility and make it easier to work with. This small step forward adds to Google's cumulative effort over the last year to dramatically improve functionality in both inboxes. In August, for example, upgrades enabled the Inbox to interact with the Trello project management application and also with GitHub's software collaboration platform. Outlook.com Gets Google Drive Support The upgrades take both companies a step closer to the goal of making their respective inboxes the single place in which all work can be done.  Over the past couple of years, Microsoft has been working on the Outlook inbox to allow users to access, create, edit and store files in the cloud without needing to leave their email. Outlook already offered a tight integration with OneDrive — which comes with an Outlook account preconfigured — and mobile app support for Box, Dropbox and Google Drive. Up until this announcement, the Outlook web app didn't offer Google Drive support. On top of the Google Drive access for Outlook.com, Microsoft this week added stronger search capabilities for email attachments and the ability to share Facebook photos from Outlook.  This means users can open and edit Google Doc, Slide or Sheets from within Outlook.com. In theory, this will include the ability to save Google documents in OneDrive with an OneDrive integration, but until Microsoft releases the web app, it won’t be possible to test that. These releases give Outlook.com access to a part of the cloud that it never had before and continue Microsoft's year-long roll of the "new" Outlook.com experience, which is due to be completed later this fall.  Title image "Back to back" (CC BY 2.0) by penerik 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Think of Microsoft’s New Outlook Customer Manager as Salesforce Light Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Hubspot Unveils GrowthBot, a Chatbot for Sales & Marketing Digital Customer Experience Is a Business Priority, CMSWire Survey Says The Curious Connections Between Zombies, Ghosts, Teen Blood & Meetings Nextiva Debuts NextOS for Workplace Communication, Engagement 5 Places Where Social Collaboration Tools Help Business Processes Digital Hub Platforms Can Improve Enterprise Collaboration Microsoft Connects SharePoint Team Sites to Office 365 Groups Useful Article?

The goal for participants is to come up with an exploit that allows remote code execution on multiple Android devices, knowing only the phone number and email address of the device. The motivation for the contest, according to the announcement post by Google Project Zero security researcher Natalie Silvanovich, is to learn more about how attacks against Android devices are discovered and carried out. "So why are we doing yet another hacking contest? Our main motivation is to gain information about how these bugs and exploits work," wrote Silvanovich on the Project Zero blog. "There are often rumors of remote Android exploits, but it's fairly rare to see one in action. We're hoping this contest will improve the public body of knowledge on these types of exploits. Hopefully this will teach us what components these issues can exist in, how security mitigations are bypassed and other information that could help protect against these types of bugs." In the contest announcement, Google Project Zero stated the contest would be different from other hacking contests, where participants would save up bugs and exploits to build an exploit chain, and then submit their finished work. Instead, competitors are expected to submit all their bugs in the Android issue tracker, after which they can be submitted by the participant at any time during the six-month contest. The catch, Silvanovich wrote, is that "[o]nly the first person to file a bug can use it as a part of their submission, so file early and file often. Of course, any bugs that don't end up being used in a submission will be considered for Android Security Rewards and any other rewards program at Google they might be eligible for after the contest has ended." In addition, Silvanovich said Project Zero will publicly share all of the vulnerabilities and exploits submitted for the competition. "Participants will submit a full description of how their exploit works with their submission, which will eventually be published on the Project Zero blog," she wrote. "Every vulnerability and exploit technique used in each winning submission will be made public." In addition to the top prize of $200,000 for the first winning entry, the second winning entry will garner $100,000 and at least $50,000 will be awarded by Android Security Rewards to additional winning entries. In other news The White House appointed Brigadier General (retired) Gregory Touhill as the first Federal CISO. Touhill is currently deputy assistant secretary of cybersecurity and communications in the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications at the Department of Homeland Security. "In his new role as Federal CISO, Greg will leverage his considerable experience in managing a range of complex and diverse technical solutions at scale with his strong knowledge of both civilian and military best practices, capabilities, and human capital training, development and retention strategies." The appointment was made as part of the Cybersecurity National Action Plan, introduced in February by President Obama, a plan "that takes a series of short-term and long-term actions to improve our cybersecurity posture within the federal government and across the country." The announcement of the appointment was posted by Tony Scott, the federal chief technology officer, and J. Michael Daniel, special assistant to the president and White House cybersecurity coordinator. Touhill's appointment comes on the heels of several high-profile government hacks, such as the OPM breach, and unflattering oversight reports on inadequate cybersecurity practices in agencies such as the FDIC. Two Israeli citizens, Itay Huri and Yarden Bidani, have been arrested by Israeli police and charged with running a massive DDoS operation, investigative reporter Brian Krebs reported. The two young men, both age 18, had been running the vDOS booter service, until this summer when the service was hacked, revealing that it netted at least $600,000 over the past two years -- and possibly much more, as vDOS began operations in September 2012. Krebs broke the story at approximately the same time the two were arrested in Israel in connection with an investigation by the FBI. Krebs reported that the two earned the money for helping their customers execute more than 150,000 DDoS attacks, and Krebs speculated that the vDOS operation may have been responsible for a majority of DDoS attacks over the past few years. As CIA director John Brennan warned that the U.S. should be wary of Russia's hacking capabilities and activities on CBS's Face the Nation Sunday. Politico reported Democratic Party state officials and parties were warned hackers were targeting them. The website obtained a copy of the email, titled "Security Alert: Please Do Not Search Wikileaks!" sent by the Association of State Democratic Chairs to its members. Recipients were warned against visiting the Wikileaks site because of concerns over the potential for being infected by malware transmitted through content on the website. Meanwhile, Brennan warned that "Russia has exceptionally capable and sophisticated cyber capabilities in terms of collection, as well as whatever else it might want to do in that cybersphere." Brennan continued: "Their intelligence services are quite active around the world, and this is something we have to make sure we're on guard for, not just for our national security purposes but also for making sure that our system of government here is going to be preserved."

A cow grazing on the banks of the River Cam in Cambridge, England, shows up in Google Street View with its face blurred for privacy. It's a harmless mistake, and one full of humor, especially given the amount of bovine puns that the Internet's technorati bestowed upon it this week. But the fact that Google's facial-recognition algorithms identified a cow—and probably many other non-human faces as well—is significant. It's at once a lingering effect of the privacy uproar that Street View faced in Europe a few years ago and a sign that Google's artificial intelligence has a lot of room for improvement. Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously pic.twitter.com/ACTBpDwno6 — David Shariatmadari (@D_Shariatmadari) September 13, 2016 The search giant has gone to great lengths to promote its ability to detect faces. Consumers are perhaps most aware of the technology thanks to the recently revamped Google Photos, which automatically detects features in your photos grouped into People, Places, and Things. The People search can organize faces from across all your images, and can even detect the same person across several years. Using similar algorithms, the Things search can identify landmarks, even differentiating between famous landmarks and their identical copies. Did you visit the Statue of Liberty replica in Paris's River Seine? Google knows. Snap a picture of the mini Eiffel Tower at Las Vegas's Paris Hotel? Google will tell you. //Related Articles In Bid to Map Faroe Islands, Residents Strap Cameras to Sheep Like all machine-learning algorithms, though, Google's must be trained using as many examples as possible. The blurry cow on the River Cam is proof that even with an image database as massive as Street View's to learn from, the algorithms still aren't perfect. To help further their training, Google is making appeals to third-party developers, who can harness the detection technology in their own websites and apps via an API. As for the blurry cow itself, Google made light of the situation. "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous," a spokesperson told the BBC. Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame."

This is their fifth consecutive Paralympic final – a record – and their third gold medal in this sport. The Iranian players slump to the turf, they are devastated. Remember, there’s not going to be a seven-a-side football competition in four years time in Tokyo, so that might be the last we see of this sport for a long while.

Trinidad and Tobago’s Akeem Stewart has also set what would have been a new Paralympic record of 61.70 and GB’s Dan Greaves in currently in bronze. Two throws left for each of the nine finalists, but it’s hard to see anybody but Blair winning that one.

In February he was named a Global Shark Guardian by the United Nations Save Our Sharks Coalition, and plans pursue his conservation role full-time when he retires from competition after the Rio Games.

Let’s start with this. As we enter final weekend, athletes, Rio fans, armchair supporters, MBM readers, MBM writers, and real journalists the world over can start to assess what impression these Paralympics have left. For some, including the broadcaster Alex Brooker, above, it has meant an awful lot – and that is some speech: heartfelt, unscripted, and live on UK television last night. Others prefer to separate the narrative and context and simply prefer to revel in the spectacle of it all – the elation, disappointment, crowds, blood, sweat and tears that come with a world-class event. Whatever your inclinations, we can all agree it has been a ruddy good Games. Tonight, keep an eye out for Hannah Cockroft and GB team-mates Mel Nicholls and Kare Adenegan as they go for a gold-silver-bronze clean sweep in the T34 800m final in the Olympic Stadium. In the pool, we’ve got a host of swimming finals to get your juices flowing as well as wheelchair fencing, basketball and tennis, where GB’s Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid face each other in the singles final. The pair won silver earlier this week together, in the men’s wheelchair doubles. But there’s plenty more, including football 7-a-side and goalball golds, to make sure you don’t spend your Friday glued to Chelsea v Liverpool.

Many companies in the automotive industry have their own models either currently on the road or being tested. The current state of self-driving varies among the different models and companies currently in development. There are companies such as Tesla who are currently on the road with their models, then there are companies such as Apple that only recently rented out space for research. In terms of self-driving car status, I usually think of it on three levels: the Apple level where they are still in the beginning stages of their vehicle, the Google level where they are still finalizing their models, and the Tesla step where we are already seeing them on the road. The current state of Apple’s self-driving car, known under the code name “Project Titan”, appears to be in relative danger. Despite being in the dust compared to Google’s and Tesla’s car, Apple is so early in the process that they are still recruiting engineers for their vehicle. All that can be assumed now is that Apple will follow their normal route and follow the modern look that Apple fans have been enjoying for years. Google’s self-driving car started developing in 2009. Though it is not as advanced in the process as Tesla, Google isn’t quite as disadvantaged as Apple is with their machine. Google’s car is currently still being tested on roads, all while boasting only one non-fatal accident. Not bad Google. Tesla motors. Tesla currently runs with a modern but not too noticeable aesthetic. Tesla Motors is widely known for their self-driving vehicles because of their progress in the industry. There are many Tesla vehicles on the road now being driven by customers. Unfortunately, the Tesla Model S found itself in hot water as of late. Last May, a fatal crash involving Tesla’s Model S vehicle was reported in Florida. From this, Tesla has been even more diligent in their software updates and manufacturing. The current state of self-driving cars is a pretty exciting one. Not quite fully mainstream, but also not just getting off the ground. There is definitely some evidence of the hard work and research done by engineers for years and it’s in the form of a purchasable, driveable car. Even though there is still much work to be done, I am more than excited for this step into the bright future of driver-less cars.   SHARE TWEET PIN SHARE Previous post Next post Other article this week The all-new College Democrats Club [The Stute]November 11, 2016 (Issue 10, Volume CXIV) SGA Constitution change proposal It’s all up to you Laugh at yourself a little Opinion Categories Campus News (453) Creative Space (8) Features (42) Full Issues (49) Online Issue (5) Opinion (681) Across the Hudson (21) Always Right (12) Campus Conservative (3) Cuisine Corner (66) Gaming Guru (4) Girl Talk (17) Letter to the Editor (41) Mind of a Freshman (62) Not With Those Shoes (28) Op-Ed (5) Ready Set Game (26) Scientific Curmudgeon (79) Senioritis (77) Stars of Stevens (17) Studying Abroad (10) Stute Editorial (81) Technically Speaking (73) The Jitsky Post (14) The Stute Reviews (8) The Stute Smackdown (14) WCPR ReWrite (12) Places To Be (4) Sports (2) Student Spotlight (5) Stupe (4) Uncategorized (31) Meta Log in Entries RSS Comments RSS WordPress.org Home Campus News Opinion Full Issues Subscribe About Contact Us Submit a LTE Submit a Tip ADVERTISE WITH US Archive Copyright 2016 | MH Newsdesk by MH Themes Share on Twitter Share on Facebook

But there is a clever way to dodge queues and Google is your secret weapon. Getty Images 3 I love queuing at Ikea. Said nobody, ever. The search engine has a really feature – known as Popular Times – which predicts when places will be rammed (or not). It’s based on anonymous data from people who opt to share their location when using their mobile. It lets you pinpoint when might be the best time to visit. For example, you can see that on Fridays at the London Eye the most popular time is between 2pm and 3pm, whereas arriving at 10am should slash your waiting time. Whereas visiting the Ikea in Manchester between 8 and 9pm on a Saturday is the best way to avoid the weekend crowds. The clever tip was picked up by MoneySavingExpert after their readers reported using it successfully. Google 3 Firstly, Google the name and location of where you want to go Google 3 Scroll down to reveal the Popular Times chart How to use the Popular Times feature on Google to avoid queues Firstly, do a Google search for the restaurant, attraction, etc. On the right hand side you will see a box with Google’s listing for the destination. If you scroll down you will see the Popular Times graph. You can then flick between the days to find the quietest times. Not all places have a times graph – it only appears once Google has enough data to establish opening times. Although, there are plenty of places where it does work across the UK.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40. They are in my queue to write about » reply Don't forget the poaching of Apple's talent Submitted by Mario Herger (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 19:41.

Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22. Hi, have you heard any news on tesla negotiating with a global mapmaker? I heard it here (webinar on high definition maps) http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation/automot... » reply Taxi model Submitted by Bejoy (not verified) on Mon, 2016-09-12 02:45. Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

As we have the last couple of months now, today we’ll be showing you another 5 Android apps that you should definitely give a shot… Navbar Apps One of the best things about on-screen navigation is the fact that you can customize it. It’s great to get updates to on-screen buttons through software updates, and some OEM skins let you adjust navigation as well. That said, it would be nice to have further customization available for the navigation bar. It does seem like Google is working on this for a future release, but for now, you can make your navigation bar your own with Navbar Apps. This free app allows you to easily adjust the look of your on-screen navigation buttons with colors, images, and more. The first big feature of Navbar Apps is the ability to change the color of the bar based on that app you’re within. It doesn’t work perfectly, but it’s a nice touch to your Android experience, although you can also set a constant static color if you’d like to. Along with that you can also add an image to the navigation bar, or show your battery percentage. Pretty soon, the developer will also be adding the ability to show music bars while music is playing. I’ll assume he means a visualizer. Tired of your boring Navigation Bar? Make it awesome! Turn it blue, make it red – anything you want. Select cool image as background or match color automatically to fit it to running app. Whatever you choose, it will be awesome! And then add some data, like battery level. All of that with Navbar Apps! Download Navbar Apps on Google Play for free Sleep Timer Just recently Google added a sleep timer to the official Google Play Music app for Android, and it reminded me just how much I love using the same feature through another app. Aptly-named Sleep Timer, this app allows users to quickly set a sleep timer for any music (or podcast) app they’re using. For me that’s Spotify, but it will also work with Pandora, Pocket Casts, and more. The app is pretty straightforward. Open it, set a timer, and hit start. From there any music you have playing will be paused automatically when the timer finishes. The app also features a customizable widget which can set and timer and open your favorite music app with just one tap. I’ve been using this app for a long time as a part of my daily routine, so I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a sleep timer. Sleep Timer lets you fall asleep to your favorite music. You simply start your music, and then set the countdown timer. At the end of the countdown, Sleep Timer softly fades your music out and stops it. Allowing you to get your precious sleep and stops your battery from draining. Download Sleep Timer on Google Play for free Conscient Our phones are getting really good at predicting what we want before we ask, and a lot of that is thanks to Google. One method Google uses to find out what users might want is the Awareness API. This takes data from various sensors on the phone and figures out what you might be doing. A great example of how this can be useful to developers and users alike is Conscient. This app allows users to create custom “fences” which take certain conditions such as walking, running, or driving and lets you assign a specific action to those conditions. For example, often when I’m driving I’ll need to pull up Google Maps, and because I’m driving I want to get that done as quickly as possible. With a custom fence I created in Conscient, I can get a notification when I’m driving that allows me to quickly launch Google Maps. I can also set it to open the app automatically if I would like. This app doesn’t work perfectly, but for basic tasks it’s great. Unlike other apps that do similar things, Conscient puts very minimal stress on your battery as well. Best of all, it’s free. Conscient uses Google’s Awareness API, which is an advanced set of tools to detect user activity with very minimal battery drain. Conscient leverages this powerful API and provides you a simple interface to let you automate basic functions in your phone. Download Conscient on Google Play for free Digit One thing that seems hard for everyone is saving money. Whether you have a lot or a little, it can be difficult to remember to put a few dollars aside. With Digit, you can do that automatically. So how does it work? The basic explanation is that Digit attaches to your bank account, monitors your spending habits, and finds little opportunities to save anything from a couple of cents to a dollar or two. That money goes into a secure savings account which you can pull from at any time. Now, whenever something free attaches to your bank account you might get worried, but with Digit there’s no need. To make money Digit takes any interest that is made off of what you save, but never takes away from what you have saved. I’ve been using the service for several months now without any issues and have saved well over $200 in that time, money that can be really useful in a pinch. The service, which has been around for a while, has just introduced a new Android app which lets you manage your savings and actions within the apps. Previously everything was handled over SMS, so this new app makes interacting with the service just a bit easier. You can even make up to $25 by referring friends to the service, if you catch my drift… Automate your savings. Digit is the free, effortless way to save money without thinking about it. Every few days, Digit checks your spending habits and saves a few dollars from your checking account if you can afford it. Download Digit on Google Play for free Muviz Music is one of the biggest uses for a smartphone, and with Muviz, you can bring your audio experience to life with a visualizer that rests on your navigation bar. For devices with on-screen navigation this means you’ll be able to see the visualizer behind your back, home, and recent buttons. If you don’t have on-screen navigation, Muviz will still work by docking the visualizer to the bottom of your display. In my brief testing of Muviz so far, I’m loving the experience. It works great, doesn’t seem to affect my battery too much, and it adds a bit of fun to your music listening experience. The app is free to download and includes several themes for free, but some of the extra options will require an in-app purchase. Bring your Music Experience to life with Floating Visualization beneath your on-screen Navigation Bar. MUVIZ is a first of its kind app that displays a Music Visualizer beneath your Navbar while you are listening to your favourite music from your favourite apps. NO root required. Download Muviz on Google Play for free Have suggestions for what apps we should feature next month? Drop a comment down below! We’d love to hear your recommendations.

Inspiration Project Muze: Cry for Joy? September 15th, 2016 by Dieter Petereit 0 FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusPinterestStumbleUponWhatsAppLinkedInXingE-Mail Project Muze, the new fashion experiment created in a cooperation between the companies Zalando and Google is well worth seeing. It might not do justice to the Zalando slogan “cry for joy”. But I cried nonetheless. Project Muze: Even the Muse is Astonished. (Foto: Pixabay.com) Can the Machine Inspire Your Clothing Style? Project Muze may be great when looking at it from an academic level. Here, Google tries to display an example of applied machine learning. The project is supposed to be some type of muse for your clothing inspirations. Sounds interesting, eh? This sure is a rather unconventional way to get to one’s own clothing design. All the algorithm asks of you is to answer a couple of questions that only deal with clothing in a peripheral way. The gender question seems feasible, although the answer won’t necessarily be evident when looking at the result. At this point in the process, I didn’t know that. In the further progress of the “design process”, I need to classify my mood, name my taste in music, as well as enter my favorite type of art. In the end, Google believes that it has gathered enough information to be able to give me a personalized clothing suggestion. This is the result: This is Supposed to be My New Look? Interesting. (Screenshot: Dr. Web) Cry of Surprise: I Can’t Accept This! Well, tell me what you think. Dieter wearing feminine pyjama pants, basically topless, and cluttered with black crystals? Seriously? Not even the most progressive stage director of any opera house in the world would make up something like that. And they do come up with some esoteric stuff often enough. I thought I might just be difficult to classify, so I looked through the gallery of already existing drafts of other muse interviewers. And, what should I say? It’s not looking any better over there. Judge for yourself: The Most Recent Trend Shows That Targes Are Back in Fashion. (Screenshot: Dr. Web) Two green targes are floating freely before and behind my upper body, while a swirling pattern is making my shirt and pants look like a colony of laevorotary bacteria, basically the Activia of overgarments. The attached targes remind me of the prime of the guillotine. Robespierre sends his greetings. Or take a look at this design: What Are You Supposed to Call This? A Generous Design? (Screenshot: Dr. Web) This looks like it could be taken from a gender-mainstreaming version of the Avengers. But nobody would put on something like this voluntarily. The bloomer-like bodysuit might prove to be quite comfortable on the couch after work. However, it doesn’t matter how long I think about this, I simply can’t wrap my head around what the strange cape, which is also able to float, is supposed to do. Do You Really Have to do Everything That’s Possible? Either I just don’t spend enough time in the world of modern fashion, which is certainly possible. Or this Google Experiment is just straight up garbage. Of course, Project Muze is based on Google’s TensorFlow, which is a library for machine learning, and is most likely very challenging technologically. Zalando‘s 600 fashion experts also contributed significantly towards the predictive decisions based on current trends. From a technological standpoint, we most likely can’t address reproaches to the agency Stinkdigital either, which also worked on the realization of the website. The result of all this effort is, simply put, unnecessary, and a good example that proves that you shouldn’t do everything just because you are able to do it. I’m sure you’ll understand that I won’t get any more “inspiration” regarding my clothing style from Project Muze. That should be in the interest of all of us.

Photo: David Garrick   I love music, and in turn, I love introducing the public that takes the time to read my work to new music.  Twenty years ago if you would have told me that I’d find artists through an application on my phone, I would’ve laughed at you.  However, now that’s how many of us interact with music and discover it as well.  While I will always contend that face to face interaction between friends, colleagues, and those who work at record shops is the best form of discovery, nowadays most people use a streaming service Spotify or YouTube to find new tunes.     Now, I have nothing against Spotify or YouTube and I myself use it to link albums usually because sometimes there’s nothing like Bandcamp or the artist’s website for people to hear what I’m writing about.  But, we as a music listening society are now streaming albums more than we’re downloading or purchasing physical copies of them, and it’s time for “Freemium” models like the free version of Spotify and YouTube for music to end, and here’s why: we’re essentially killing artistry.   To be fair, I pay for a streaming service with a Google Play account, and it runs $9.99 per month. Through it I can listen to pretty much anything I want to for that amount, and while I find streaming itself to be “art on the cheap,” it’s essential as a music journalist.  The reasons behind this choice were ease of use, quality of sound, and the fact that Google Play pays the most per stream at $0.0073 per stream.  The amounts from the streaming sites that I used came from the most current available data available, from October of last year off of the site Information Is Beautiful.  The site compiled the information, available here, to make the chart below.  Looking at the chart, which was made before the Apple acquisition of Beats music (though ironically, Apple Music pays less than half of the Beats amount at $0.0013 per stream).  You can see that Spotify and YouTube both have the largest amount of users, while also paying out the lowest royalty rates.  Both also offer free versions, in fact there isn’t a paid “all you can stream” version of YouTube to date.     It should be noted that YouTube is owned by Google, meaning that they aren’t off of the hook by paying a higher royalty per stream rate with Google Play.  In fact, when you pay for Google Play, you get a free YouTube Red account included with your purchase.  But it’s pretty disgusting when you realize that five very large entities devalue art so much that they aren’t willing to pay for it.  The reason that these amounts are important is because that there’s no other medium like the entertainment industry, where you can pay one rate for all you can consume.  And since streaming isn’t going away anytime soon, paying for what you stream is the only way to insure that artists will have the ability to continue to afford to make their art.     Here’s where this all kills artistry: money.  The payouts are just as confusing as the playlists, where the biggest streams stem from how they’re curated, and who’s controlling them.  To start, while Spotify claims one royalty rate, this article here tells a different story, while local bands like Bang Bangz tell a whole new story.  As the article shows, the payout per stream isn’t the percentage that Spotify reports to pay, and Bang Bangz told me that off of 100,000 streams, that they received a royalty check of a little over $800.  All of these figures fall short of the $0.0011 rate, and most figures today show the royalties to be closer to between $0.0004 and $0.0011 per stream from Spotify.  Of course, this is before you find out the dirtiest side of the streaming giant’s world: the playlisting.  If you were unaware, the three largest record labels — Sony, Universal Music, and Warner Music Group — all own a stake in Spotify.  The 18% of ownership is broken down with Sony/BMG owning 5.8%, Universal Music owning 4.8%, and Warner Music owning 3.8%, as well as a 1.9% stake from EMI and the rest made up by Merlin, as per a report from The Swedish Wire.  The labels have all but been confirmed — as per this article and this report from Billboard with Warner Music CEO Stephen Cooper — that the majors have a hand in curating the playlists.  Meaning that aside from the fact that the revenue that Spotify brings in from advertising and monthly fees for subscribers off of an artist’s plays not only goes partially in the hands of the three largest record labels, but they decide who gets on the largest revenue streams — the playlists — as well.     While I’ve always said that streaming and Spotify in general is the “new radio,” at least major market radio stations weren’t owned by the record labels, though payola scams would often deter you from thinking that they did.  What this all means is that when artists can’t earn enough to afford to record an album in a proper studio, they can ultimately either choose several narratives that aren’t good for music lovers.   Option one is to give up and walk away from the music industry entirely.  Option two is to never use streaming services, thus keeping their music out of the ears of the masses.  Or the worst option, option three, is watering down their music in hopes to generate more streams to earn more revenue.  While initiatives from larger acts like Taylor Swift and at one time Radiohead have been to leave Spotify, the answer is solely in the hands of YouTube Music and Spotify to fix this problem through a higher royalty rate, achieved through making their service pay only.     Tidal Royalty Breakdown, Photo: Courtesy of Tidal   Killing off of the Freemium model would mean that while the cards are still stacked against independent artists, that they’d have a chance at a better rate per stream.  Both Tidal and Google Play are pay-only and both have much higher per stream royalty rates than anyone else. Of the reported 100 million subscribers in the Spotify world, only 39 million are paying subscribers, meaning that the Freemium users far outweigh those who pay. This means that it’s time for 61 million people to pay up or hop off of the free music gravy train.  Of course, if you buy an album from an artist at their show, or buy direct from their website, you run a chance at the artists receiving more money overall.     So, what’s the answer?  I say that every artist needs some form of visibility on a goliath like Spotify, but take the big money first.  If you’re an artist, your own website or Bandcamp page is the best place for your music to be online when you release anything.  If you’d like to place singles from your albums on Spotify at the same time, that’s a great plan.  If you release the album to Spotify and other streaming sites 30 to 90 days after the album has been released through your website or through Bandcamp, that’s a great idea as well.  But if you plan to debut an album on a streaming service like Spotify or Soundcloud, you should realize that you’ll never earn back the cost of making the album itself in most cases.   Unless you’re an artist who will perform for free, you have no reason to argue against these services switching to a pay only model.  Can you give away your music for free?  Absolutely.  Are there people who have had success from giving away their music for free?  Absolutely.  But, look up the successful ones versus those who are not, and I promise that the successful ones are a smaller number than those who are not under the free business model.   If you’re a consumer, the answer is simple: anything worth getting your hands on is worth paying for.  No matter what streaming platform you decide, paying for it is always better than getting it for free.  If you’re willing to pay for the small amount of content on a site like Netflix for $7.99 a month, then paying $9.99 a month for any album you want to listen to at any given time is a bargain.  In a world where music can go down an uninspired rabbit hole as fast as it can go to the most creative spaces, starting to pay for streaming music versus using a Freemium model is the only way to insure that music will always stay creative, and that everyone gets at least a larger piece of the pie.  As it stands under this free model, no one who writes or performs music stands to win, and the unsustainable model needs to go the way of the buffalo and fast.

Contents 1 History 2 Prefs 3 Documentation 4 Engineering 4.1 Code walkthrough 5 QA 6 Telemetry 7 Links History Google Safe Browsing was an anti-phishing extension released by Google on labs.google.com in December 2005. Google has released this extension to the Mozilla Foundation under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 in order that it might be used as part of Firefox if desired. We've landed this change on the trunk as a global extension as of 7 March 2006. You can read the discussion that lead up to to its integration in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329292 Google started migrating their Safe Browsing to version 4 of the protocol in 2015. We are currently working on integrating V4 in our code base with a incremental approach. That is, we will be landing V4 patches progressively and leave the V2 stack up and running until the V4 is extensively tested and the Shavar server has been upgraded to V4. In other words, V2 and V4 will co-exist for a while to ensure we don't break Safe Browsing. See the V4 implementation plan for the milestones and bugs involved.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Sep 17, 2016 - Page 11　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Indonesia to probe Google AFP, JAKARTA Indonesia on Thursday said it would launch investigations into Google after the technology giant allegedly refused to cooperate with the country’s tax department, an official said. Google has denied the allegations, declaring it had paid all taxes in Indonesia since opening its Jakarta offices in 2011. The Indonesian government has repeatedly asserted the California-based company had outstanding tax issues to resolve. Muhammad Haniv, a senior official with Jakarta’s tax office, said Google had refused a request to allow tax officials to examine its financial statements. “We are now elevating this to an investigation, because they refused to be examined. This could be classified as a criminal offense,” Haniv told reporters, adding that Google generates tens of millions in advertising revenue, but contributed little in tax. ‘COMPLIANT’ Jason Tedjasukmana, the head of corporate communications for Google Indonesia, said in a statement that the company had always worked closely with the government and had “complied by paying all taxes which apply in Indonesia.” Jakarta has also applied pressure to other foreign tech behemoths, such as Facebook Inc and Yahoo Inc, over their tax arrangements in Indonesia. TECH BOOM Global tech businesses have flooded Indonesia in recent years to capitalize on the exploding number of Internet users in the Southeast Asian nation, which has an enormous population of young people with smartphones. One-third of Indonesia’s 255 million people have access to the Internet, but analysts say that number is likely to increase as connectivity improves across the archipelago.

It's already available in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Kansas City, Kansas and Missouri; Nashville, Tennessee; Provo, Utah; and Salt Lake City. The North Carolina activity may alleviate some of the doubts over Google Fiber's direction, which mushroomed several months ago, when the company acquired Webpass. Experimenting With Wireless Google executives last month filed an Experimental Radio Service License that would allow the company to offer wireless high-speed service in up to 24 U.S. cities, including a number of California cities and towns: Atwater, Mountain View, Palo Alto, San Bruno, San Francisco and San Jose. In addition, they are seeking permission to test wireless in Boulder, Colorado; Kansas City, Kansas and Missouri; Omaha, Nebraska; Raleigh, North Carolina; Provo, Utah; and Reston, Virginia. The few portions of the application that have not been redacted include detailed explanations of Google's plans to conduct radio experiments in support of Citizens Broadband Radio Service technologies, using experimental transmitters. The authorization would last up to 24 months, according to the filing. "The overarching concern regarding the granting of an experimental license is whether it will interfere with the operation of authorized devices and services," explained FCC spokesperson Mark Wigfield. "Therefore, an experimental license will be coordinated with those responsible for all potentially affected stakeholders," he told the E-Commerce Times, such as other bureaus within the FCC. "In this coordination process, an experimental license can be accepted as is, be modified to prevent interference, or be rejected," Wigfield noted. "If approved, an experimental licensee must accept any interference from other parties, and must immediately stop operations if a complaint of interference is made." Shifting Focus Google Fiber acquired Webpass in a bid to accelerate its buildout of ultra-high speed broadband access, after struggling for years to gain access to local markets dominated by rival broadband providers like AT&T, Comcast and others. Webpass provides high-speed service to thousands of customers in the San Francisco Bay area, Chicago, Boston, San Diego, Miami and some surrounding areas, with speeds up to 1000 Mbps. The announcement of the acquisition came after months of controversy surrounding Goodle's attempts to access telephone poles in the Bay area, beyond its existing service at Stanford University. The shift toward wireless broadband makes sense, given the inherent difficulty of breaking through incumbent dominance to gain access to the infrastructure required for competitive broadband service in metropolitan areas, observed broadband analyst Craig Settles. "Google's decision to put chips in the wireless game seems to have taken some folks in the industry by surprise -- but why? Those of us involved in municipal broadband since the Philadelphia wireless days know that wireless is cheaper and faster to deploy, especially in urban areas," he told the E-Commerce Times. Google has long said that ease of deployment -- essentially the ability to access telephone poles -- was a key driver in the deployment of Google Fiber, Settles noted. What the industry has been waiting for is the innovation necessary to allow gigabyte-level speeds for fixed wireless service. Despite the promise of wireless broadband, it's unlikely to make a major dent in solving the rural access problem, according to Christopher Mitchell, director of community broadband networks at the Institute for Local Self Reliance. "Google acquired Webpass, which uses both wireless and fiber, to connect buildings," he told the E-Commerce Times. "I don't know that this is a good solution for single-family homes."

 The exec Google hired to oversee Glass is now in charge of design for all hardware products Avery Hartmans Sep. 16, 2016, 12:09 PM 2,178 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ivy Ross, the head of Project Aura. Google+/Ivy Ross The head of Google Glass is now leading the company's efforts to design an expanding collection of hardware products whose appeal extends beyond the techie crowd. Ivy Ross, who previously served as head of Google's computer glasses  effort, is now overseeing the design and user experience for all hardware products, according  to her LinkedIn page . The new title reflects Google and parent company Alphabet's efforts to build new businesses that complement its internet services stronghold.  Google is ramping up its efforts to build its own hardware devices, with a new home-speaker device that will compete with Amazon's popular Echo, slated for release in the next few months.  In April, Google hired former Motorola executive Rick Osterloh to helm the hardware group, which includes the Nexus line of phones and tablets, the Chromecast TV dongle and other products. Ross, a fashion industry veteran, will focus on making sure the various gadgets are easy to use and have a look and feel that appeals to consumers. That's something that Google has struggled with in the past, particularly with the Glass device that Google launched a few years ago and for which Ross was hired to oversee. The futuristic-looking Glass product initially wowed the techie crowd, but was quickly criticized for being difficult to use and for its geeky appearance. Google stopped selling Glass to consumers in 2015 and renamed the Glass division Project Aura, as Business Insider reported at the time.  Google declined to comment on Ross's new role.   SEE ALSO: The head of Google Doodle says he sees 'Google' in everything NOW WATCH: How to see everything Google knows about you Loading video...

He hopes to run for a second term when the time comes. (Photo: Ayrika Whitney / The Leaf-Chronicle)Buy Photo 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE CLARKSVILLE — This month, Jim Durrett is wrapping up two eventful years as Montgomery County's mayor. With two more years to go in his first term, and a bid for a second term coming into sharper focus, Durrett feels the groundwork has been laid for long-term achievements in Fort Campbell's growth and stability, downtown Clarksville redevelopment, and futuristic industrial development accompanied by dramatic job creation. Buy Photo  (Photo: Tony Centonze/The Leaf-Chronicle) But with the growth comes growing pains, and Durrett acknowledges that the county he leads has plenty of them, from transportation gridlock to providing adequate services and amenities for both urban and rural areas of the county. All of this, while hoping to keep local tax rates at least status quo, if not lower — a priority for a large segment of his constituency. Durrett says he is enjoying being the county's mayor, a job that currently pays $151,740 a year. He emphasized that salary is set by state statute, not the County Commission, and has grown a little over 2 percent in two years. Durrett is already saying that he'll run for a second term, and indications are he's building the campaign war chest he might need to tell his administration's story. Recently, a private fundraiser event was held in Clarksville to "reflect" on his first two years. "I think it's pretty obvious now that I am looking at running for a second term. At this point I am pretty sure I will be throwing my name back in the hat for another run at the job in two years. The campaigning for it is now probably about a year, or year-and-a-half away from starting up," he said. 'Challenges into opportunities' Asked to rate his own success thus far, Durrett said the jury is still out to some extent, because there is so much more that he wants to do. "Over these past two years we've kind of been able to turn challenges into opportunities for Montgomery County," he said. Durrett is no stranger to the public realm. He's seen it from the inside for much of his life especially from the time he spent as chief of staff to former Clarksville Mayor Johnny Piper, but he admits a few surprises he's encountered over the past couple of years. Buy Photo  (Photo: THE LEAF-CHRONICLE/Ray Howze) "The biggest thing is the number of committees that I'm chairman of. It takes so much of your time, chairing and sitting on all of the many different committees," Durrett said, who noted that some of the 56 committees that existed when he started have been eliminated. Lots of committees mean lots of meetings, and that can be frustrating, he said, because it often leaves little time to hone in on some of the things he wants to do for the county. "All of that is important, don't get me wrong, but there is so much to do that I want to get done." He said he also prefers to deflect credit for any achievements to the broader administration and county commissioners. "When we talk about accomplishments in these first two years, first of all let me say that I don't think I, alone, have done anything. But together with our staff and the County Commission, we have done some things."

When the Department of Defense announced federal budget cuts creating what was potentially feared to be a 50 percent reduction in force at Fort Campbell, a series of public listening sessions was hosted by the DoD at different military installations including the local post. "We had to put together the presentation on Fort Campbell, and what it means to our community ... and quite frankly, I felt that Montgomery County took the lead in putting that listening session together, working with our partners in the city (of Clarksville), Hopkinsville and Christian County, and of course Fort Campbell and the surrounding area." In the end, Fort Campbell was spared dramatic cuts.

In December 2014 Clarksville-Montgomery County and Middle Tennessee got word that Hemlock Semiconductor was closing, before it even was to begin any production of polysilicon. Durrett said deep disappointment was replaced by a new era of excitement and possibilities for the community. "I'll never forget the day they called us into a meeting and told us they were going to mothball the plant," Durrett said "We landed Google in Hemlock's place, which meant fewer jobs — about 70, versus the 500 that Hemlock had promised in the first phase, but when you talk about a company with a global brand like Google, even the announcement itself puts us on the worldwide map. We believe this will also be a project that will attract more business interests, many of them related to Google being here," Durrett said.

Durrett's administration also sought, and gained, County Commission approval for a dual-faceted attempt to help stimulate downtown revitalization. The downtown area has suffered through a series of economic failings since, and even shortly before, the January 1999 tornado, and a priority of Durrett's has been to try some ways to help restore the downtown tax base. "What we've accomplished for downtown Clarksville also ranks pretty high in our first two years of accomplishments as a community, I think. I've always said that if something good happens in downtown, it's good for all of Montgomery County. The development of civic plaza, and the approval of tax increment financing for downtown redevelopment — between these two things I think we're going to be able to someday look back on that and say that it was a defining moment in bringing our downtown area and its tax base back," he said. The city council later voted to join the tax-increment financing plan. The civic plaza does is not recorded on city or county tax rolls. Disappointed with relationship with city Buy Photo  (Photo: THE LEAF-CHRONICLE/Ray Howze) Durrett says his greatest obstacle has been achieving a good working relationship with the city of Clarksville, chiefly Clarksville Mayor Kim McMillan and her administration. His goal in the next two years is building a stronger rapport. "My biggest disappointment in these first two years is not being able to work with the city like I would like to. Am I part of the problem? I'm sure that's probably the case. Is some of it the city's problem? I'm sure it is," Durrett said. "It's a problem that's out there, and everybody knows about it, so there is no use in denying it or pretending that it's a problem that doesn't exist. It's something that I think about and pray about every day. So I hope in the months ahead we can cross this bridge and have a greater spirit of unity and cooperation between the county and the city. We'll be able to get a lot more done for the betterment of our community if we can achieve this," he said. Lost time with family The hardest part of being county mayor, or perhaps any elected official, is the time commitment invested in it. Recently, District 4 Commissioner Mark Riggins resigned for that very reason, saying he needs more time with his family. Durrett said he keenly understands this. Buy Photo County Mayor Jim Durrett gives his remarks during the 20th anniversary ceremony for Bridgestone Metalpha U.S.A. at their facility in Clarksville on July 26, 2016.  (Photo: Ayrika Whitney / The Leaf-Chronicle) "The level of time commitment to do the job, that I think it takes to do it well, causes me to lose a lot of quality family time with my wife, kids and grandkids. You get phone calls almost around the clock," Durrett said. But the enjoyment and the challenge of making Montgomery County a better place, both in big and small ways, energizes him. Eyes on downtown With two years left in his first term, Durrett says there is much work left to finish, and new challenges and opportunities that he is eager to turn his attention to. Buy Photo County Mayor Jim Durrett sits in a wheeled excavator as he starts the demolition of the Bank of America building on May 5, 2016. The site of the building will be the future site for the Civic Plaza park.  (Photo: Ayrika Whitney / The Leaf-Chronicle) "I think we've got to finish all of the great things we've started. We need to grow our tax base in Montgomery County, and the best place for us to do that, is downtown. The civic plaza project has been accompanied by some controversy, but when people start seeing that project come up out of the ground, I firmly believe they are going to be extremely proud and optimistic about the future. "We're also going to be looking at a possible expansion of our industrial park. If we need more acreage out there, that's a good thing, because it means we are filling that property up with companies that create jobs and build upon our quality of life. "At the same time, we also need to be mindful of the needs of the people in our rural areas. ," Durrett said. Troubles with county offices In the meantime he is enjoying a positive working relationship with the County Commission and county department heads. There are a few exceptions to note, including a rocky go of it with County Trustee Brenda Radford whom his office wants to locally audit after previous troubling findings by the state, much to her dismay. Buy Photo County Mayor Jim Durrett speaks to the crowd at the 66th annual Clarksville Area Junior Better Beef show held at the Montgomery County 4-H Arena on May 10 , 2016.  (Photo: Ayrika Whitney / The Leaf-Chronicle) Also, there's Bi-County Solid Waste Management System, whose outgoing director, Pete Reed, has been questioned about alleged issues of mismanagement. Some of those issues are still ongoing as Durrett's chief of staff, Jeff Truitt, is now serving in a secondary role as interim director of Bi-County to, as officials often say, "right the ship." "When I first came into office, we had a brand-new mayor and eight brand-new commissioners. We're not always going to see eye to eye, but the great thing about this county government is that even when we disagree, we respect each other and just move on to the next project. We do business the right way," Durrett said. 10-year goal The short-term goals of his administration are hoped to yield long-range dividends. "Looking 10 years down the road, I see a major public venue in downtown Clarksville, I see a community that is even more deeply-rooted with Fort Campbell, a community that continues to be attractive for new industry and new businesses, and one that continues to grow at the rapid pace we have seen over the last decade. Buy Photo County Mayor Jim Durrett gives the opening remarks during the Clarksville-Montgomery County Memorial Day ceremony held on May 30, 2016 at the William O. Beach Civic Hall.  (Photo: Ayrika Whitney / The Leaf-Chronicle) "Our biggest growing pain continues to be infrastructure, specifically managing the traffic flows around the community. TDOT, right now, is just living from year to year. I believe the last figure I saw is that we are behind to the tune of about $6 billion in new roadwork statewide. The county commission recently passed its legislative agenda, which was focused on pressuring state legislators to fund projects to alleviate traffic congestion. "I know our county is going to continue to grow, so we're going to try to grow smart, and hopefully keep our property tax rate at a level that is suitable to all Montgomery Countians. Everything we do takes money, so we need to be good stewards of those tax dollars while providing the things for the community that will make it safer, more competitive, and more attractive," he said.

SUBSCRIBE Google downplays the algorithm ranking update this week as “normal fluctuations” Was there a major Google algorithm change this week? Many webmasters believe so. Barry Schwartz on September 16, 2016 at 9:33 am More Earlier this month, we reported about significant chatter around a Google algorithm update. Well, it looks like we have another update to report to you this week. On Tuesday of this week, there were some early signals of a Google update. Those signals intensified Thursday and seem to just be getting stronger day by day. In short, the webmaster and SEO community is confident that there was an algorithm change with the Google organic search results this week. Not only are the SEO forums and communities discussing it, the tracking tools from Mozcast, Accuranker, RankRanger and others have also shown significant fluctuations in the organic rankings in Google. Google’s PR team wouldn’t directly comment. Instead, they pointed to a tweet by John Mueller from Google: “nothing specific, sorry — we’re always working to improve things!” This is in response to questions about an algorithm update. John also said this morning on Twitter that these are normal fluctuations: @akrampathan21 @rustybrick @methode fluctuations in search are normal and a sign that our #algorithms & #engineers are working hard. — John Mueller (@JohnMu) September 16, 2016 In any event, it seems this is not directly related to the Google Penguin update we are all anxiously awaiting.

SUBSCRIBE There’s no Google Search widget for the iOS 10 Search screen: why that matters Google search could be on the iOS Search screen with a widget, if it wanted. Why isn't it offering that option to its users? Danny Sullivan on September 16, 2016 at 9:00 am More iOS 10 has made widgets much more noticeable than in past releases. That’s an opportunity for Google to regain some search attention in Apple’s mobile operating system. However, Google’s still not taking advantage of this. No Google Search for the iOS Search screen? Widgets — think of them as mini-applications that you don’t have to open to interact with — aren’t new to iOS. They’ve been around since iOS 8 was released in 2014. But with iOS 10 out this week, they’ve gained a new prominence as now being offered for the iOS “Search” screen. That’s right. iOS has a Search screen. That’s the official name of what you get when you swipe right from the Home screen, a name that’s been used since iOS 9. Widgets can now be added to the iOS Search screen. Given it’s a place expressly designed for searching, you’d think Google would want a search widget there. But so far, there isn’t one. What Google could be doing To give you an idea of what a widget could mean for Google, look at how it works for Microsoft. That’s Google’s chief search competitor in the United States. Microsoft provides a widget for its search companion, Cortana: With the Cortana widget, Microsoft lets someone to do a search directly via the iOS Search page. OK, tapping “Ask Cortana” actually just launches the Cortana app. And while I put it at the top of my screen, it wouldn’t be there for most people unless they manually moved it higher. But at least Microsoft has a search offering for that page, for iOS users who want it. Google does not. Microsoft also offers a Bing widget, though it oddly lacks a search box: That seems an oversight by Microsoft, or perhaps there’s some technical issue or outright restriction against iOS 10 widgets offering keyword searching. What Google is doing Back to Google, it’s more remarkable that it doesn’t offer a Google Search app widget when you consider that it does offer other widgets, including one for Chrome that launches voice search: Google News has a widget. Google Maps also offers at least two widgets, one for nearby transit times and another for personalized travel times: What Google has lost in search on iOS Over the years, Apple has slowly but diligently cut Google out of the iOS search ecosystem. Google was replaced by Bing as the default search provider for Siri in 2013. In 2014, Google was replaced by Bing for Spotlight Search. Google does remain the default search for Safari, despite expectations that Apple would drop it there. Still, a Google Search widget would seem a way for Google to claw back some of the exposure it has lost. That’s even more so given how the new widgets are making the iOS search screen more like Google Now with proactive suggestions. Google Now is part of the Google Search app. Some of its suggestions could flow into a Google Search widget, along with an actual search box. Then again, if most people are like those I asked about widgets on Twitter, it might not make a difference. My unscientific survey found most people aren’t using iOS widgets (Cast your own vote to see the latest results): Want to answer a question about iOS & widgets for me? Take my fast poll. Have you…. — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) September 15, 2016 Bottom line: Don’t expect a Google Search widget any time soon. We did ask Google about all this, and the company said it had no comment. If you want to get started with widgets that are offered, swipe right in iOS 10, then scroll down to the very bottom of the Search screen and look for the “Edit” button. That’s where you can enable any widgets offered by apps you have installed. About The Author Danny Sullivan Danny Sullivan is a Founding Editor of Search Engine Land.

SUBSCRIBE How to manage local listings for enterprise brands Getting a handle on the data for multiple-location businesses can be a significant challenge. Columnist Brian Smith provides step-by-step guidelines to making it happen. Brian Smith on September 16, 2016 at 9:45 am More When it comes to local listings management, there’s a direct correlation between the number of listings you manage and the amount of grumbling, cursing and general hand-wringing you do. It isn’t easy for enterprise brands to get their location data in order. Juggling the info for hundreds or thousands of locations can quickly become overwhelming. And it’s not uncommon for enterprise brands to feel like they’re playing SEO whack-a-mole, constantly beating down duplicate listings, inaccurate data and any local search changes that inevitably pop up from Google. Fortunately, there are steps enterprise brands can take to tame their unruly location data and prevent it from getting out of hand in the future. The unique challenges facing enterprise local listings management For enterprise brands just starting to get their location data in order, local listings problems can typically be boiled down into two categories: an overwhelming, baffling, disparate, inaccurate and outright maddening heap of location data; and human nature’s basic resistance to change. I’ll address each of these in turn. Overwhelming location data Perhaps the biggest challenge for enterprise brands trying to manage their location data is the overwhelming number of sources that their location data comes from. A large organization will typically have multiple databases that contain various elements of location data from departments such as accounting, shipping, legal and so forth. Furthermore, while all of this data likely meets the individual needs of the department that it comes from, it’s highly unlikely that the data meets the stringent quality standards Google and the other search engines require. In other words, their location data isn’t actionable beyond their originally intended purpose. The location data problem for enterprise brands is also compounded by the fact that many of the addresses for their various locations aren’t standardized. Often, before an enterprise brand decides to bring all of their location data management under one roof, those responsible for entering location data into Google My Business and the like are the individual store managers and franchise owners. How many of those individual store managers and franchisees know how to properly format an address that Google will like? The answer: not as many as you would hope. Most people don’t put much thought into addresses beyond whether or not the mail arrives. If your mail gets to its intended location, the address must be correct, right? Not necessarily. It’s a human who delivers your mail, and, while Google is getting better at predicting user intent, they still have a way long way to go before they are on par with humans. Resistance to change The second major obstacle that enterprise brands must overcome when beginning to clean up their location data is humanity’s general resistance to change. When a corporation decides to start managing their local listings and their respective social media accounts, individual store managers and franchise owners are often reluctant to relinquish control over those accounts, especially if they’ve been managing them since day one. Franchisees, in particular, are especially resistant to relinquishing control. They will often come around when they start seeing improved rankings and more local search traffic. But that doesn’t make it any easier getting over the hump of that initial change. Large enterprise brands can also face resistance from within the corporate office itself. This is especially true if a department makes a unilateral decision to start making changes to the location data management process without consulting the rest of the company. So how do you overcome the problems of overwhelming location data and our general resistance to change? First and foremost, there must be buy-in from the top of the organization. The exec team must make it a priority to clean up the location data, and they must provide those who will actually carry out the change with a mandate that has teeth to it. Second, there should be an education period in which the coming transition is explained to the rest of the company, or at least to those the change will affect. The long-term benefit must be made apparent to the owners and managers of individual locations. But be aware, even the most eloquent explanation will still be met with resistance. However, laying some of the groundwork beforehand by doing education can help ease the transition. Consolidating your data Once you’ve got corporate buy-in and have explained the coming changes, the next step is to consolidate your location data before beginning the process of cleaning and standardizing it. The goal is to gather your location data into a single database and establish it as the single source of truth for syndicating out to aggregators and round-tripping that data back into the various departments so that they are working with accurate and up-to-date information. Standardize and cleanse your data If you have all of your location data in a single place, and you’ve established that database as your source of truth, the next step is to standardize your addresses and begin cleaning up inconsistencies. I recommend standardizing your addresses using a validator tool such as USPS ZIP + 4 or any other address tool that scales easily. However, simply because you’ve standardized your addresses doesn’t mean your addresses are necessarily correct. You’ll need to visually verify the pin placement for each and every location across Google, Foursquare, Bing, Yelp and the other third-party sites. Every. Single. Pin. Unfortunately, there’s no quick and easy way to do this. As I mentioned in a previous post, there’s no good way to automatically adjust geocode pin placement. If you find an error, you’ll have to go in and manually fix it. Visually verifying pin placement typically requires going into Google Street View and making sure the pins match with the actual location. But be careful. Sometimes Google Street View hasn’t been updated recently, and rural areas, highways and country roads can prove especially tricky when it comes to determining correct addresses and pin placement. Additionally, it’s not always easy plotting individual locations contained within larger and multi-level locations. Until indoor mapping takes off, shopping malls and skyscrapers might require you to look at the map on the location’s web page to find out where individual stores are located within the larger structure. From there, good geospatial reasoning should help you put the pin in the general vicinity. Claim duplicate and closed listings Once you’ve standardized and verified your location data, it’s time to claim rogue pages that are out there on the web representing your brand but aren’t owned by you. Keep an eye out for pages that your customers created for individual locations, as well as those that store managers or franchisees might have created. Likewise, be sure to claim any pages for closed locations, thus ensuring that they appear closed in local search results and will remain so. You don’t want these orphan pages competing against valid nearby locations for search results or leading potential customers to an empty storefront. Syndicating and the virtuous cycle Once you’ve consolidated your location data, cleaned it up and established it as your single source of truth, it’s time to focus on syndicating the data and making sure the changes you made are actually reflected in the local search ecosystem. In short, you’re looking to make sure the data you’re syndicating out has been accepted, processed and pushed out correctly. Fortunately, if you’ve made it this far into the location management process, most of the initial grunt work should be behind you and you’ve built a solid foundation for managing your local listings going forward. But the process never truly ends. As your data constantly changes and evolves, it needs to be constantly updated, syndicated and round-tripped back internally to the company. As new locations open up, treat those locations like you did during your initial cleaning: standardize them and verify their location information. Unfortunately, no matter how aggressively you keep on top of your location data, inaccurate data will inevitably crop up, and duplicate pages will emerge. As always, compare what gets created out there in the local search ecosystem to your source of truth and make adjustments accordingly. Automation My final word is on the importance of automating the local listings process (Disclaimer: I work for a local marketing automation company). While brands with only a few locations can get away with manually running the location data process, this isn’t feasible for enterprise brands. The moment you throw a few hundred or a few thousand locations into the mix, your location data gets so complex and overwhelming that it becomes a nightmare. Fortunately, if you’re an enterprise brand, the necessities of the digital age make it likely that you’re already automating at least some parts of this process. Continue down that path. As location data becomes more critical to things like location-based advertising, augmented reality and tracking the ROI of store visits, the need for automation will only increase.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents How the feds used Internet searches to find 5 child pornography victims Let me Google that for you: EXIF data and public Internet used to crack open case. by Nate Anderson - Sep 16, 2016 3:30 pm UTC Login to bookmark 74 Postal inspectors routinely investigate child pornography cases in the US. Joshua Lot/Getty Images In 2013, US federal agents investigating the child pornography collection of one David S. Engle—who was later sentenced in Washington state to 25 years in prison—came across a new set of eight images. The pictures showed five boys, ranging in age from around seven to 15, urinating outdoors, shaving their pubic hair, and posing naked in bathtubs. According to an affidavit from Postal Inspector Maureen O'Sullivan, who helped investigate the images, the photo set was "emerging and being widely distributed and traded by child pornography collectors on a national and international scale." Being new and uncatalogued, the images were forwarded to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which maintains a vast database on prohibited images for use in investigations and image blacklists. While law enforcement generally focuses on finding those who create and/or trade child pornography, a simultaneous effort is made to identify—and if necessary to secure—the victims. At the federal level, this task is centralized within NCMEC at the Child Victim Identification Program (CVIP)—and this new image set wound up at CVIP accordingly. The investigation of the pictures, which took three years to complete, opens a rare window into the world of digital detectives who specialize in tracing some of the world's most horrific imagery. It turns out that federal agents largely run an investigation the way most of us would: on the public Internet. An Embassy Suites hotel room—but which one? CVIP took the obvious first step and pulled all the Exchangeable Image File (EXIF) metadata from the photos. Amazingly, this data had never been scrubbed (even Facebook scrubs EXIF metadata from uploaded photos for security and privacy reasons). Though the images were not tagged with GPS locations, they did have dates attached. This would become a crucial clue. Without names and dates, finding the photos' creator would be difficult. Even if one could identify a particular hotel used in a photo, the huge number of possible dates would make guest check-in registries nearly worthless. But with a date, identifying a particular hotel might solve the case immediately. To that end, CVIP agents looked through a subset of the pictures that had been taken in a hotel room on August 20, 2010. Background items suggested a location in Colorado, while the décor of the room hinted at an Embassy Suites hotel. To find out which hotel, CVIP "compared rooms in the images to online photos of hotel rooms in all of the Embassy Suites in the area." (This sounds like either a Google image search or a careful look at the Embassy Suites website.) The team decided that the location was the Embassy Suites in Denver. The information was sent back to the postal inspectors, who fired off a subpoena to Embassy Suites for everyone registered at a "small subset of the hotel's rooms" on the date in question. However, the registry turned up no clear leads. The trail went cold. Let me Google that for you In February 2015, CVIP came back to the postal inspectors with new data. Unrelated investigations around the country had turned up additional images from the set, showing the same boys in Western locations, many outdoors. James Parkhurst UMCEXIF data revealed that these photos were taken two days earlier than the others, and one additional boy was now pictured. More importantly, "a particular landmark" in the new photos offered a specific location: a cabin within the Antero Hot Springs cabins in Salida, Colorado. In March 2015, the owner of the cabins sent postal inspectors information on guest rentals from the time. On the day the photos there had been taken, the cabin in question had been rented to "James Parkhurst" and three guests. Rather than delving into some super-secret law enforcement database, agents turned to Google and Facebook to ID Parkhurst. Quick searches revealed a 55-year-old man with the same name who lived in Portland and was working as the Executive Director of Camp and Retreat Ministries for the United Methodist Church's Oregon-Idaho Conference. A search of Facebook pages belonging to Parkhurst showed conversations about trips to national parks with boys he knew—along with names and (non-sexual) photos of the five boys pictured in the prohibited image series. The full Facebook This discovery led to an August 2015 search warrant for the Facebook accounts of Parkhurst and of the boys. Cross-referencing the conversations and pictures returned by the social network with the prohibited images and their EXIF data, investigators sketched out specific dates and times during which Parkhurst appeared to be on trips alone with the boys in locations matching those in the prohibited photos. For instance, the earliest photos dated to August 2008, when Parkhurst allegedly took all five boys on a trip to Las Vegas, the Hoover Dam, and Yosemite National Park. As part of that trip, the group stopped at Travertine Hot Springs and Buckeye Hot Springs. Inspectors found references to both places on a public website devoted to naturism ("nudity is commonplace"). Another stop, at El Dorado Hot Springs, was listed on a separate site as one of the "best places for nude camping in Arizona." With another prohibited image, investigators used "public search engines" to identify a particular hotel in Mariposa, California. As confirmation of the location, traveler pictures on a "hotel review website" matched the bathroom amenities and décor in the prohibited photo. Still more images were identified based on "landmarks that are searchable on Google" or by matching one pond to "an online image of the Olympic Hot Springs in Olympic Park, Washington." Travertine Hot Springs in California. gastondog Revenge of the thumbnail Several of the photos from the set were circulating among child pornography collectors in cropped versions, with the pictures usually altered to remove an adult or to focus attention on the genitals. But the crops didn't hide the original image completely. Investigators found that several of the image files still held thumbnail versions of the original image. One of these smaller but un-cropped images showed, in O'Sullivan's words, "Parkhurst nude next to [one of the boys]." Secret databases Assembling the case against Parkhurst eventually moved beyond open source information. Law enforcement periodically busts allegedly "legitimate" businesses selling things like "naturist films from around the world" that are actually child pornography. When that happens, investigators seize and archive all sales records for future investigations. For instance, in 2006, postal inspectors and the Los Angeles police raided Insider Video Club, which dealt in "DVDs, VHS tapes, and still images of nude men and boys"; the company's database was then seized. And in October 2010, Toronto police shut down Azov Films, which specialized in this material, and they sent a copy of the sales database to the US. As part of the Parkhurst investigation, postal inspectors ran his name against these kinds of sales databases—and found hits at both Azov and Insider Video Club. Parkhurst had allegedly ordered Swim Party for $24.95 back in 1997 and Boys in the Mud in 2005 for $45.95. Each video showed nude young boys and contained "no meaningful dialogue or storyline." Each video had been sent directly to Parkhurst's address. Federal Judge Youlee Yim You.But it was a third "ping" against a sensitive database that appears to have kicked the investigation into urgent mode. Postal inspectors plugged away on the Parkhurst case all the way through to July 2016, when they realized that Parkhurst had ongoing contact with the boys in the images—and that he had another trip coming up. A law enforcement sensitive database revealed that Parkhurst had booked tickets to Europe for himself and one of the boys. The trip would begin on August 3. On August 1, Postal Inspector O'Sullivan took a search warrant to Federal Judge Youlee Yim You in Portland, had it signed, and assembled her team. They raided Parkhurst's home the next morning. According to O'Sullivan, the search team found some of the prohibited images on "one or more" of Parkhurst's digital devices. Parkhurst then agreed to speak to investigators. He allegedly admitted that he had taken the photos, acknowledged masturbating to at least some of them, but denied that he engaged in sexual activity with the boys. Parkhurst also suggested that his collection of nude images would not "qualify as child pornography." (US child pornography law actually includes a clause banning "lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area" as a way to short-circuit any "but I didn't actually touch them!" defense.) Parkhurst was arrested. According to the Oregonian, he resigned from his job and surrendered his ministerial credentials a few days later. He was eventually transferred to Denver, where he will stand trial. He had his first court appearance there this week. Creative searching While the Internet has enabled an explosion in child pornography—an issue that was largely under control in the analog era, thanks to the difficulty and expense of finding, creating, printing, and distributing it—it at least makes investigations simpler, too. Even though law enforcement has access to expensive or secret databases, many of the Parkhurst investigation leads were based on EXIF data and publicly available Internet pages. Google, Facebook, hotel review and naturist websites, online maps, and image searches—it's all grist for the mill. Once a hotel or cabin has been located, once a person has been ID'd on Facebook, once a trip is suspected, then it's time for the subpoena, the warrant, or the secret database. Still, with all of the tech, search, and monitoring tools available to authorities today, one of the most useful investigative skills remains the ability to use the public Internet creatively.

Thinking of a Friday night torrent-and-chill session? Think again. Google and Mozilla are reportedly blocking direct access to The Pirate Bay's download pages. The homepage and search results load without issue, but when trying to download an actual torrent, users are met with a warning message in Chrome ("The site ahead contains harmful programs"—pictured) and Firefox ("Reported unwanted software page!"). "This Web page at thepiratebay.org has been reported to contain unwanted software and has been blocked based on your security preferences," Firefox says. "Unwanted software pages try to install software that can be deceptive and affect your system in unexpected ways. Chrome users are similarly told that "Attackers on thepiratebay.org might attempt to trick you into installing programs that harm your browsing experience (for example, by changing your homepage or showing extra ads on sites you visit)." According to VentureBeat, Google's Safe Browsing service powers security features in both browsers. So if you're desperate to watch Independence Day: Resurgence or The Secret Life of Pets, you'll have to look elsewhere. Or, simply press on in Chrome by clicking "Details" and "Visit this site" or "Ignore this warning" in Firefox—but only, as VentureBeat pointed out, if you trust The Pirate Bay. //Related Articles Oops: Is Kanye West Downloading Software on The Pirate Bay Though not immediately clear, the block may have been triggered by an ad network running malicious ads, in which case TPB will eventually remove it. The process, however, could take days, leaving users locked out of the site for the foreseeable future. Neither Google nor Mozilla immediately responded to PCMag's request for comment.

Ellington Jump to content Baker Student Media ⋅ PO Box 65 Baldwin City, Kansas 66006 | (785) 594-4559 | orangeedit@gmail.com Home News Sports A&E Voices Galleries Staff BU now using Turnitin plagiarism detection software Image by Alyssa Glover. By Sarah Baker Friday, September 16, 2016 Sign in to favorite this Discuss Comment, Blog about Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter Beginning this fall, Baker University has renewed its subscription to Turnitin, a controversial plagiarism detection software, to aid faculty and students in the discovery and prevention of plagiarism on campus. About Turnitin The Turnitin website markets the product as “technology to improve student writing” that was created in the late 1990s. Turnitin’s Feedback Studio says it has amassed a collection of more than 600 million student papers. Word Around Baker What do you think should be the punishment for a student's first plagiarism offense? More Approximately five years ago, Baker University used a licensed plagiarism-detection software, but because of budget concerns, discontinued the service. Since then, faculty members have voiced their desire to have an equitable and consistent tool for finding and assessing incidents of student plagiarism. Despite Turnitin’s success in college spheres over the years, the software has received mixed reviews. There have been some law cases, like Vanderhye v. iParadigms LLC, featuring students who have refused to submit their papers to the program – all submitted papers are saved to an external database to which another party could have access – on the grounds Turnitin is violating their copyright and privacy rights. Both a district and an appeals courts affirmed Turnitin was in the right under fair use - using the papers in a new and innovative way. Fearing the potential for future lawsuits, though, some colleges have either banned the entire service or have incorporated a policy exempting students from being required to submit work if they choose not to. Students have also posted on various forums – such as YouTube comment sections and Reddit feeds – saying that they have failed an assignment, or been asked to rewrite work, due to a large percentage of their paper being flagged as plagiarism, when they say they did not plagiarize and that it was due to professor and/or software error. Some students’ posts suggest that the professor-errors are a result of a lack of knowledge of how the software works, and the system-errors stem from a computer not understanding the circumstances or context in which the flagged portions are set. When a paper is submitted, the Turnitin software flags any instance of possible plagiarism, including quotes, the bibliography source, required/standard subject heading, article names and amount of similarity to other papers. It then calculates a percentage of the submitted work that is plagiarized or similar to other works. A blog post published by Turnitin on its website stated its response to such student claims: “ There is a very distinct difference between what Turnitin flags as matching text (aka: similarity index) and plagiarism. Turnitin will highlight any matching material in a paper - even if it is properly quoted and cited. Just because it appears as unoriginal does not mean it is plagiarized; it just means that the material matches something in the Turnitin databases. We leave it to the instructors to look at a paper and the originality report to make the determination of whether or not something is plagiarism, and to what extent - intentional plagiarism, unintentional plagiarism, improper/lack of citation or mere coincidence. Best practices from instructors suggest that Turnitin OriginalityCheck be used as a teaching tool to address citation and academic honesty, not only as a punitive tool .” Spurred by this controversy, Susan Schorn, a writing flag coordinator at the University of Texas in Austin, was inspired to conduct a study about the effectiveness of both Turnitin and UT’s plagiarism detection software of choice, SafeAssign, in discovering plagiarism. She started her study in 2007 and conducted a follow-up in 2015. Schorn’s experiment began with a sample of test essays with 23 commonly-cited sources among humanities courses, including various levels of plagiarism. During her study, Schorn concluded that Google searches surpassed both systems in the amount of copied material detected and simplicity of use. Although, both systems could outperform Google in collusion, or similarity, of papers, for the 23 plagiarized sources in the papers – which were strategically placed there by Schorn and her colleagues based on common methods they saw in students’ papers – Google, again, surpassed both systems in the amount of correctly-found plagiarism with 91.3 percent. Turnitin and SafeAssign found 60.76 and 43.4 percent, respectively. Schorn’s data suggests that while Turnitin is more effective than competing software, it is not as effective as manual Google searches. The overall effectiveness and usefulness of Turnitin as a plagiarism detection software may be up to colleges, faculty and students to determine themselves. Turnitin at Baker How this software will affect Baker University has yet to be seen, considering it is the start of the year and Faculty Senate is currently in the process of amending Baker’s academic misconduct and plagiarism policies to include more strict measures of dealing with dishonesty. Mass Media and Visual Arts Department Chair Joe Watson said that Baker is not requiring faculty and students to use Turnitin, but faculty members do have it available as a tool to detect and prevent plagiarism. “There is no policy that says Baker faculty have to use this software,” Watson said. “I am sure there are going to be some of my colleagues that don’t want to use it, and if they don’t want to, they don’t have to.” Watson says that he is passionate about plagiarism, and he will spend a lot of time trying to find it if he suspects it in a student paper. He knows that Turnitin is not perfect, but he sees it as a valuable teaching tool for students to learn how to avoid plagiarizing. “Frankly, I plan to use [Turnitin] as a tool,” he said. “One of the things I want to do is have students turn in drafts, so that if there is something that raises a flag, they have the opportunity to change it. I find no pleasure in finding plagiarism. Telling a student that I found plagiarism in one of their papers is one of the most painful things I do as a professor … If there is a tool that I can use in one of my classes that students could use to submit a draft and catch something like, ‘Oh, my gosh! I forgot to cite that! Or ‘I forgot a quotation mark!’ – things like that do happen – and students can avoid it and clean it up before they turn in a final version, I am all for that.” Acknowledging the issues of professors not understanding the program fully, Watson said that the Baker faculty has set up training sessions where faculty learn how to use the software correctly. Watson knows that a computer-generated software like Turnitin still needs a human element to be most effectively used. “I think with any software system, nothing is ever going to be perfect. It is important how you use it,” he said. “If the computer software messes up, I am not going to hold [students] accountable for that. I think that, like with anything, you have to learn how to use it and not abuse it … You have to include a human element, not just take the report and use it verbatim. It will produce a report but you have to use your own common sense to read the report and apply it as you see fit.” Watson said he is looking forward to implementing the Turnitin software in his classes in the coming weeks as both a teaching tool and a way to lift the burden of his plagiarism hunting. “Something I am excited about is that this takes the burden off me as a professor. I can submit it, wait for the report to come back, read the paper, look at the report and make a judgment. I am sure there are things that might be better, but it’s all in how you use it.” Agreeing with Watson, senior English literature major Kristen Robbs thinks that Turnitin could be a good source for helping students understand plagiarism. “I also know that sometimes plagiarism can be hard to understand. Especially working as a writing tutor, I can see how hard it can be to understand how to take someone else’s ideas and use them to support your own without taking credit for their work,” Robbs said. “I think this software is a good start to physically demonstrating what plagiarism is and opening students’ eyes to ways they may be plagiarizing and not realize it. For underclassmen in particular, it could really up the learning curve on knowing how to write a research paper with your personal opinion as well as the opinions of others.” Robbs is familiar with software like this and thinks it is a helpful tool for both students and faculty. Her father was a teacher and used this software to check his students’ work. “My dad has used this program before as a teacher, and it was helpful for him to be able to double-check on papers that seemed off,” Robbs said. “Sometimes it would frustrate him to see how students would try to get away with blatant plagiarism. "I think it’s a nice tool to have at the school’s disposal, both for professors and students, and will help identify and improve on plagiarism problems, but it must be used wisely and, especially initially, with a dose of grace; otherwise, it could turn into a case of guilty until proven innocent.” More like this story Honesty always the best policy Wikipedia (The Wiki-Whack Way to Research) Plagiarism crucial issue in classroom, workplace Baker University gaming program ranked by Princeton Review Sports Illustrated gets a plus-sized remodeling Comments Use the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.

Plenty of people are giving "Google Teat View" a hard time after Guardian editor David Shariatmadari noticed the software that automatically blurs people's faces in close-ups on Google Street View had also blurred the face of a cow in Cambridge, UK. Following the lead of many on Twitter, Google decided to laugh it off. "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous," the company says, per the BBC. "Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame." One guy suggests the cow needed to keep its identity hidden because it "had a restraining order against the Burger King." (Two guys staged a Street View "murder.")

A Mobify technology approach that builds on the success of Responsive Web Design, Progressive Mobile provides two to four times faster page load speeds, improving overall user experience and ensuring that customers can complete transactions faster. Faster website load times and page speeds have become essential to eCommerce: according to Facebook, 40% of customers leave if a page takes three seconds to load, yet the average U.S. retail mobile site loaded in 6.9 seconds, as Google reported in July 2016. According to Mobify's analysis of large volumes of data amassed from ecommerce sites in Q2 2016, slow page speeds interfere with mobile customer engagement, contributing to an unsatisfying web performance through poor user experience and interrupted mobile moments. With Progressive Mobile, the world of the mobile web and native apps is converging, with apps and mobile-optimized web managed as one unified customer experience. "Progressive enhancement is compelling to retailers because it leverages the investments they've made and makes them better," said Mobify CEO Igor Faletski. "Progressive Mobile brings a fast, app-quality experience to web visitors, leading to conversion rates comparable to desktop." With Mobify Progressive Mobile Web, retailers can provide seamless shopper experiences across mobile screens, including: High-speed performance with faster page load times for higher conversions Shopping pages optimized for conversions with product category, listing, and display pages, cart and checkout all designed to provide a smooth pat to conversions App-like experiences for web such as push notifications and offline mode, which allows shoppers to continue browsing in areas with poor -- or no -- wifi. Growth in customer lifetime value from lower friction re-engagement To learn more about implementing Mobify Progressive Web, visit https://www.mobify.com/platform/progressive-mobile/ About Mobify  Mobify has invented The Mobify™ Platform, the leading mobile customer engagement solution for retailers and brands that want to boost revenues, keep up with customer expectations, and protect their competitive edge.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website seven  ×   =  63 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Since the June 20 Facebook stock split vote passed, investors have been asking us, "Will the Facebook stock split happen in 2016?" Here's the answer: If the Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB) stock split is anything like the Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG, GOOGL) stock split, it won't happen until 2018. The Facebook stock split faces similar issues as Google did before it could split its stock. This is why it could take so long… Why the Facebook Stock Split Could Take Two Years In 2012, Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page controlled nearly 70% of the voting power for Google, now known as Alphabet. But because the tech giant had been criticized for its long-term projects that lose money – like its "Other Bets" sector – the founders wanted to make sure they could always run the company without putting all of their focus into short-term growth. In a 2012 shareholder letter, Page said that he and Brin wanted to protect Google from outside pressures that wanted the company to sacrifice future opportunities because of short-term demands. What Are Google's Other Bets? Google's advertising business is extremely successful. In Q2 2016, ad revenue netted Google $7 billion in profit on $21 billion in revenue. But Google's "Other Bets" sector is currently losing massive amounts of money. Other Bets generated $185 million in revenue. But it lost $859 million. This part of Google’s business includes smart-thermostat maker Nest, life science research organization Verily, the high-speed Internet unit Google Fiber, and projects in self-driving cars and Internet balloons. Even though Brin and Page controlled the majority of the company, activist investors could acquire enough stake in Google to try and pressure Brin and Page to change Google's long-term plans. Don't Miss: This is your ticket to bigger and better returns… and it won't cost you a penny. What are you waiting for? Read more… For example, activist investment firm Starboard Value LP only owned a 1.7% stake in Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO) as of March, according to Reuters. But because of constant pressure from Starboard to unlock more shareholder value, Yahoo gave up four board seats to the activist investment firm at the end of April. So in order to keep voting power and do what Brin and Page thought was best for the company, the duo announced a plan for a 2-for-1 stock split on April 12, 2012. Every shareholder would get two shares of GOOG for each share they already owned. But before the split could happen, a pension fund sued Google. It claimed that the 2-for-1 stock split Google proposed was unethical. The lawsuit alleged Brin and Page were insulating themselves from the voices of common shareholders. In June 2013, Google settled with the plaintiffs before going to court. The lawsuit, though, caused the split to be delayed until April 3, 2014. And just like Google, Facebook is being sued over its stock split. Trending: How to Buy Bitcoins A shareholder filed a class-action lawsuit against Facebook on April 30. The lawsuit claims the Facebook stock split is unfair to shareholders because shareholders don't receive any value from the split. Zuckerberg gets to retain control of the company even while he sells off his shares to support his Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Zuckerberg will have to fight or settle this lawsuit before the official Facebook stock split date can be set. If it takes Facebook as long as Google to settle the lawsuit, the stock split could be delayed until 2018. And we don't want Money Morning readers waiting until then to purchase more shares of FB. Here's why… Make This Move Before the Facebook Stock Split Date Join the conversation.

The back-and-forth between the two web giants began in June when Microsoft showed that Edge outlasted not only Chrome, but Opera and Firefox as well when all were running on the same type of PC. Google retaliated last week, using the latest version of Chrome to prove that it came out on top in battery life. But now Microsoft is back, again claiming to be the best. As Microsoft looks to prove the efficiency of its Edge browser and Windows 10 as a whole (especially with the recent Anniversary Update), it points out that Google’s test last week was merely a comparison between an older version of Chrome and the latest release. It did not compare the browser against any other competitors, including Edge. So, Microsoft has gone a re-created Google’s test, using the exact same Vimeo clip and setting it to loop on the same hardware (a Surface Book), but also including Opera and Firefox as well. Here were the results: Edge: 13:25:49 Chrome: 12:08:28 Opera: 9:37:23 Firefox: 8:16:49 But Microsoft went a step further and even re-created its battery test from June, which relied on looping a video streamed from Netflix as opposed to Vimeo. To little surprise, the test showed that Edge again came out on top: Edge: 8:47:06 Opera 7:08:58 Chrome 6:03:54 Firefox 5:11:34 While these tests may or may not be very reflective of everyday use in real world situations, it’s clear that Microsoft is desperate to prove that Edge is a major player, if not the best, in Windows 10 browser market. The company is even opening up the testing process for anyone to try, putting the exact test used on GitHub, and detailing the methodology that was followed.

Shopify made a change where users can now easily check their past orders by viewing their Shopify confirmation page. The Shopify confirmation page has the conversion pixels, which can lead to the pixel firing off and "double counting of your conversion within AdWords," Google added. So these Shopify users should make an update. They need to update your conversion tags to include the Order ID.

Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP Donald Trump attempted to finally resolve an issue that is thought to have caused him significant damage with minority voters by admitting that Barack Obama was born in the US after years of promoting false claims that the US president was born in Kenya. But the Republican presidential candidate continued to falsely claim that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy theory. Clinton spoke only a few blocks away at the Black Women’s Agenda symposium, held at a downtown hotel. Clinton said that “there is no erasing” Trump’s role in spreading the “birther” gospel. “For five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,” she said. “His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. “He is feeding into the worst impulses, the bigotry and bias, that lurks in our country. Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple, and Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.” Speaking in Virginia, first lady Michelle Obama told an audience of college students that criticism of her husband’s birthplace have been a constant companion since 2008, without mentioning Trump’s name. “There were those who questioned and continued to question for the past eight years and to this day whether my husband was even born in this country,” she said, alluding to the Republican nominee without mentioning him by name. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party will not be allowed to take part in the first televised debate of the race for the White House,the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced today. Johnson, once a Republican governor of New Mexico, has pinned his hopes on taking part in the debates. He and Stein, however, fell well short of the 15% national polling average required to participate. Donald Trump today named one of the nation’s top anti-abortion activists to his campaign coalition, in the clearest signal yet that the presidential candidate has fully embraced Republicans’ typically harsh stance against abortion. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B Anthony List, a group that works to elect Republican, anti-abortion women, will chair the loose coalition of conservative, anti-abortion rights leaders who are working to elect the Republican nominee. Trump’s campaign also announced that he would commit to a law banning public funding of abortion.

Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images Speaking at a campaign rally in Miami, Florida, Trump criticized Clinton’s stance on gun-control issues, characterizing her stance as wanting to “abolish” the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. (This claim has been debunked.) If Clinton were truly as anti-gun as she claims to be, Trump told the audience, her Secret Service detail should disarm itself. “I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons - they should disarm. I think they should disarm immediately, what do you think?” Trump asked the raucous crowd. “Let’s see what happens to her.” Trump was deeply criticized in August after suggesting at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, that gunowners could take the Second Amendment into their own hands if Clinton were elected and began nominating Supreme Court justices. “Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment,” Trump said at the time. “If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know. But I’ll tell you what, that will be a horrible day.” The remarks were seen by many - including the Democratic nominee herself - as hinting at calling for Clinton’s assassination, or that of her judicial nominees.

Inevitable chants of USA! USA! follow. He returns to address the crowd in Spanish, and the audience is notably quieter. Even a mention of Marco Rubio, the Florida senator and former Trump opponent in the primary race who is hugely popular around these parts, raised barely a ripple. But other speakers, conservative commentator AJ Delgado, a senior Trump campaign adviser born to Cuban-immigrant parents, and Carlos Curbelo, a Republican congressman from South Miami who has until now been lukewarm on his support for Trump, got the crowd fired up again, with the now-familiar “Hillary lied” narrative.

I want my president to be respected,” he said. “Obama? He went to Cuba and nobody waited on him. We need a stronger president. We need Donald Trump.” The arena at the James L Knight centre, however, was filling up slowly, with plenty of room still in the bleachers with Trump scheduled on stage in less than half an hour.

Obama cast the election as a choice between “one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president” and someone who doesn’t “take the job seriously”. Ticking off a list of accomplishments of her husband’s administration, Obama argued that with the past eight years as a guide, Trump is neither prepared nor qualified to be president. Michelle Obama. Photograph: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP “A candidate is not going to suddenly change when they get into office – it’s the opposite,” Obama told the crowd of mostly students and young people at George Mason University in Virginia. “In fact, because the minute that individual takes that oath, they are under the hottest, harshest light there is.” She referenced her moving speech at the Democratic National Convention, “when they go low, we go high,” going after the Republican nominee without mentioning his name. “Being president isn’t anything like reality TV,” she said, drawing loud cheers and applause. Obama recalled the 2008 campaign, reminding the audience that raising questions about a president’s experience, qualifications and judgments is all part of a very public vetting process to be president. “And then there were those who questioned and continued to question for the past eight years and to this day whether my husband was even born in this country,” she said, alluding to the Republican nominee without mentioning him by name. Trump helped fan the flames of birtherism, a conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the US but in Kenya, and used the issue to help propel his political ambitions. Facing dismal approval ratings among minority voters, Trump admitted on Friday morning for the first time that Barack Obama was born in the US. Obama is a powerful and popular ally for Clinton, especially among young voters. New polling shows that millennials, disappointed by their options for president have turned toward third-party candidates. The First Lady’s appearance on a college campus in the battleground state of Virginia, the First Lady’s event is part of a broader push by the Clinton campaign to win back some of the millennial voters who have strayed in recent weeks. Next week, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic challenger whose campaign was powered by young people and students, will campaign for Clinton in the coming days. “Elections aren’t just about who votes but who doesn’t vote,” she said, imploring the young people in the crowd to support Clinton. She encouraged them to fight the urge to want to “hide under the bed” and avoid the election altogether. She also addressed a complaint many young people who felt inspired by Sander’s underdog campaign have leveled at Clinton. “I hear folks saying they don’t feel inspired in this election,” Obama said. “Well let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I’ve had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job, and here is what I absolutely know for sure. Listen to this: Right now we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president.” Perhaps above all, the campaign event was a testament to Obama’s enduring popularity. “It is so hard to believe that it is less than 2 months until election and that my family is almost at the end of term,” Obama said. The crowd broke into a raucous round of chanting: “Four more years” chant. “No,” Obama protested, waving her hand at the crowd as the chant continued. “No!” “I promise you,” she said, “Barack and I will continue to work for you for the rest of our lives.” Updated at 4.51pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.16pm EDT 16:16 Donald Trump’s campaign is attempting to prove the false allegation that Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign ignited the birther rumors about then-opponent Barack Obama’s citizenship with an interview transcript from a CNN phoner with Clinton’s former campaign manager.

At the time of its creation, the leaders of those two parties made no effort to hide the fact that they didn’t want any third party intrusions into their shows.” “The CPD may scoff at a ticket that enjoys ‘only’ 9 or 10% in their hand-selected polls, but even 9% represents 13 million voters, more than the total population of Ohio and most other states. Yet, the Republicans and Democrats are choosing to silence the candidate preferred by those millions of Americans.” “It is unfortunate that the CPD doesn’t believe such a voice should be heard.

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← Man wielding meat cleaver slices New York City patrolman’s head Wade’s Wetback Target → YouTube Has Quietly Begun “Censoring” Journalists Who Criticize Government Posted on September 16, 2016 by Joe from MassPrivateI Anti-Media – by Alice Salles Earlier this month, YouTube, the behemoth video-sharing website was accused of censoring users. Claiming some of their videos had been barred from making money through the company’s ad services, YouTube hosts like Philip DeFranco spoke out against the policy, claiming over “a dozen of his videos had been flagged as inappropriate for advertising, including one dinged for ‘graphic content or excessive strong language.’“   In a video entitled “YouTube Is Shutting Down My Channel and I’m Not Sure What To Do,” DeFranco called YouTube’s policy “censorship with a different name,” since users touching on what the company considers to be controversial subjects end up losing money. “If you do this on the regular, and you have no advertising,” DeFranco added, “it’s not sustainable.” While YouTube has already confirmed its policy regarding what it considers unfit for monetization hasn’t changed, the issue might lie elsewhere now that the company seems more efficient in enforcing its own rules. As a matter of fact, the content policy changed in 2012, when YouTube first introduced its “ad-friendly” guidelines. But while an algorithm is allegedly used to spot and “de-monetize” videos that break the company’s rules, many continue to accuse the company, currently owned by Google, of having “vague” descriptions of what its leadership considers ad-friendly. YouTube rolled out its monetization tool in 2006, when ads consisted of videos that would pop up at the bottom of the user’s screen. If the user did not click on it, it would roll for about ten seconds before going away. But as ad executivespressured YouTube to “to do a better job at promoting its creators,” the relationship with its advertisers changed. As better and even more intrusive ads were added to YouTube videos, the company allegedly became more concerned with the content. Those who are affected often complain about copyright claims, but some complain about another type of targeting — one that involves power players. YouTube Content Creators Speak Out Derrick J. Freeman, the host of FR33MANTV, told Anti-Media that he monetizes all of his videos, “and every day some video — even much older ones — gets slapped with some kind of warning or another because of music playing in the background somewhere. Usually a public place.” While Freeman’s work is often political in nature, he hasn’t seen any of his videos being flagged for breaking YouTube’s rules concerning subjects related to war or political conflicts. Mat Bars, another YouTube user, also complained about copyright claims. Asked about the alleged censorship problem, Bars told Anti-Media that “what it really most likely comes down to is advertisers not wanting their ads to be associated with certain things.” To the YouTube host, the company is “mostly blameless in this. The site isn’t even profitable, so letting advertisers push them around like this suits their best interests.” Instead of complaining about censorship, Bars added that what affects him personally is “the copyright system.” But to more radical political figures who gather a considerable number of followers on YouTube, things are slightly differently. To Luke Rudkowski, the man behind the popular channel We Are Change, YouTube’s policy of nixing monetization on some of his most popular videos has been a problem for a long time. “For years,” he told The Anti-Media, “I have monetized and still get f*cked from it.” Especially, he continued, “[when I launch a video about] Hillary, or war and foreign policy.” When his videos touch on drugs or guns, however, he says ads remain in place. “When the videos only have ‘Hillary Clinton’ they do fine,” he added, “however, when we add ‘FBI’, that’s when YouTube” springs into action. Anti-Media journalist and senior editor Carey Wedler got her start on Youtube and has had a similar experience with herchannel. She explained the first time she realized the site had singled out her videos was “a couple of weeks” after she “posted a video about how America’s culture of militarism is an underlying contributor to domestic mass shootings.” She continued: “The video was released shortly after the Orlando shooting, which occurred in June. By July 6, I had received an email saying the video was not ‘advertiser friendly.’ Two days later, I received another email about a video I released at the beginning of June — before I released the mass shooting video. This video, which pointed out inconsistencies in Bernie Sanders’s record and questioned his ‘revolutionary’ status, was also stripped of monetization.” While the mass shooting video’s monetization has been restored without her appealing the company’s decision, her Sanders video remains ineligible. The Sanders video focused largely on his record of supporting war and the military-industrial complex. Her other videos affected by YouTube’s policy include “What Every American Needs to Know About Radical Islam,” a video “that challenged rampant Islamophobia and jingoism right after the Paris terror attacks last November,” and “Why I’m “Ready for Hillary!,” which the creator claims to be an “extremely sarcastic indictment of Hillary Clinton published before she announced her candidacy early last year.” Other videos by Wedler that suffered the same fate include “How America ‘wins’ the wars in Syria & Iraq” and “How I became a “self-hating Jew.” All of the de-monetized videos contain anti-war sentiments. According to the prolific writer and vlogger, YouTube only bothered to email her notifications regarding the changes in monetization for the Sanders and the mass shooting videos: “I noticed the [other] videos had all been stripped of monetization when I logged into Youtube to check out the two that had been officially flagged. However, when I checked my settings following receipt of the two emails regarding mass shootings and Bernie, my overall monetization setting had been switched off — meaning none of my videos were monetized.” She claims to have “never selected that option” prior to learning about the issues with the videos mentioned previously, yet when she turned the monetization option back on, “the monetization reactivated — but only for videos that hadn’t been specifically flagged.” “I also noticed that my videos before the self-hating Jew video hadn’t been rejected for monetization at all,”  she said. In cases involving YouTube’s decision to flag her videos that included notifications, Wedler added, YouTube failed to give her “a specific reason as to why the videos were stripped of monetization. I’ve seen some screenshots of those emails from other Youtubers … and some contain reasons. Mine didn’t, though it’s pretty clear to me that in my case, it’s because they are considered ‘controversial.’ Some discuss war and some contain images of war, and they are always questioning military violence.” While Wedler agrees that this type of policy is “not direct censorship … it does amount to an implicit attempt to discourage me and others from saying controversial things.” She added that while YouTube is a “privately owned company that can decide which content is appropriate for its advertisers, … if they are deciding [which of] my videos shouldn’t be allowed to generate revenue, they are effectively removing much of my incentive to continue producing content on the platform.” Despite the company’s policy, Wedler vows to continue making these videos simply because the message is what matters. Google and Its Addiction to Buying Influence As Wedler stated, YouTube is a private company and it has the right to set its own policies. But it’s undeniable that the site’s owner, Google, has, on a number of occasions, shown its favoritism through lobbying, prompting many to highlight the company’s appearance of favorable bias toward Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Google went from spending $80,000 on lobbying in 2003 to over $16 million in 2014. After 2014, Google, Inc. becameAlphabet, and in 2015, Alphabet invested over $16 million in lobbying. To date, the company has spent over $8 million on Washington politicians. Alphabet’s top recipient this election cycle is, unsurprisingly, Hillary Clinton. But despite its knack for influence buying, Google has, over the years, created relationships with think tanks that would have criticized the tech giant’s crony capitalist ways under different circumstances. According to the Washington Post, Google has embarked on a quest to woo free market organizations by populating “elite think-tanks such as the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the New America Foundation” with its fellows, including “young lawyers, writers and thinkers paid by the company.” From the Post: “To critics, Google’s investments have effectively shifted the national discussion away from Internet policy questions that could affect the company’s business practices. Groups that might ordinarily challenge the policies and practices of a major corporation are holding their fire, those critics say.” Claiming to be defenders of privacy, Google successfully waged an aggressive lobbying campaign within Washington to defeat a congressional effort that could have put Google in the middle of a very nasty antitrust fight. After supporting the European Union’s antitrust prosecution of Microsoft, Google found itself the target of the same type of scrutiny, being accused of unfairly discriminating against users. With the excuse of going after companies like Google for antitrust law violations, Congress came up with the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), a bill disguised as an anti-online piracy fix that would have allowed the federal government to target“illegal copies of films and other forms of media hosted on foreign servers.” The bill would have hurt Google the most because the search engine would have several results deleted from its database, requiring “ISPs to remove URLs from the Web, which is also known as censorship last time I checked,” Google chairman Eric Schmidt said. Just one month before SOPA was unveiled by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), Schmidt appeared before Congress during a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hearing where a Republican senator “accused the company of skewing search results to benefit its own products and hurt competitors.” As this hearing took place and Google was grilled by lawmakers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Motion Picture Association of America lobbies pushed Congress to pass harsh anti-privacy legislation, accusing companies like Google of giving users access to pirated music and movies. Afraid of the backlash caused by the hearing, Google feared the Hollywood lobby would end up hurting many of its partners, as well as smaller organizations directly tied to Google. But the search engine giant had a way out — its aggressive lobbying and partnership building skills. As SOPA appeared poised for passage, Google and several other tech firms stood in opposition and the bill finally failed. While SOPA was, indeed, a farce — and privacy advocates in Washington were happy the bill didn’t see the light of day — it’s important to note how hard Google worked to keep it from becoming a reality, putting the Silicon Valley giant closer to powerful institutions that, in theory, are against crony capitalism. But after SOPA, the FTC went back to the drawing board, threatening to investigate Google’s alleged antitrust violations further. At the time, the “company’s rivals, including Microsoft and Yelp, were aggressively pressing arguments that Google was exploiting its dominance in the search business.” Reaching out to another partner, George Mason University’s Law & Economics Center, Google and the university put together “the first of three academic conferences at the GMU law school’s Arlington County campus,” which, according to theWashington Post, helped to shape the FTC’s approach to the Google probe from then on. At the third academic conference held at GMU, Google remained present as a silent partner. As “[a] strong contingent of FTC economists and lawyers were on hand for the May 16, 2012, session,” the Washington Post reported, research financially backed by Google was presented by GMU lawyers and economists. And “[i]n January 2013, after an investigation that spanned more than a year and a half, the FTC settled the case with Google, which agreed to give its rivals more access to patents and make it easier for advertisers to use other ad platforms.” From the publication: “But when it came to the charges that Google biased its search results to promote its own products, the five FTC commissioners all voted to close the investigation, saying there was no evidence the company’s practices were harming consumers.” As Google became more involved with politics, other lobbying opportunities would arise. More recently, Google got involved in yet another powerful lobbying effort, which started when the company hired the former administrator of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to serve as the company’s Director of Safety for Self-Driving Cars, proving the revolving door that presidential candidate Barack Obama promised to nix is still alive and well. The effort paid off, and personal injury attorneys are now concerned that Google may try to push still more regulations, forcing regulators to stick the human driver with the blame for crashes and getting Google’s autonomous driving system off the hook. Whether YouTube’s ad policy has anything to do with its parent company’s politics is impossible to determine. But as we analyze Google’s influence in Washington, it’s important to note that, whether you agree with the tech giant on none, some, or all issues, governments create the incentives for companies like Google to continue rent-seeking. As the economist David R. Henderson puts it, individuals “are said to seek rents when they try to obtain benefits for themselves through the political arena. … licensed electricians and doctors [for instance] often lobby to keep regulations in place that restrict competition from unlicensed electricians or doctors.” Companies like Google are champions of this practice, which has helped to protect the brand’s popularity by keeping competitors at bay. So it’s not a surprise to see many claiming their content is being censored by Google’s YouTube. After all, with the amount of power the company holds in Washington, it’s as if Google — or Alphabet — is an actual wing of the government.

The cow was snapped by Google's cameras at Coe Fen, Cambridge, and seemingly given the same treatment humans receive for privacy reasons. A tweet by The Guardian's David Shariatmadari highlighting the sight was retweeted more than 9,000 times, the BBC reported. Google admitted its face-blurring technology had been "a little overzealous". The cow's face can clearly be seen grazing near the river River Cam on an image taken slightly further away, but Google seems to have blurred it for a close-up view. Google's Street View launched in 2007 and received widespread media coverage as cars mounted with cameras mapped streets around the world. To help combat privacy concerns, software is used to automatically blur human faces. Shariatmadari spotted the bovine anomaly and posted it on Twitter, saying it was "great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously". "Udderly ridiculous," said one user in reply. "Google teat view," said another. It has also been reported by the Cambridge News and national media in Britian. So far the tweet has been liked more than 12,000 times. A spokesman for Google said: "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous." "Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame," the spokesman added.

We have now finished our apprenticeship, where we have completed three rotations in different service areas offered by Fresh Egg. Read on to discover how we have found our final four months. Monet Final rotation: Biddable media Biddable media was my third and final rotation completing my year’s apprenticeship at Fresh Egg. There is no denying that I have learnt masses from my time in Biddable and it has been the complete opposite to my previous SEO rotation. After submerging myself within revision and taking the Google exams to earn individual certification, I was able to proactively assist the team in the everyday running of PPC campaigns. Using tools such as SEMRush and Google Keyword Planner has allowed me to conduct research before implementing builds in AdWords Editor. Monitoring the accounts to ensure they are not over/under spending is critical, thus I have learnt how to use AdWords data to monitor budget and continually optimise the account, through the use of Search Query Reports. With the support of the team, I quickly grasped all things PPC and I am leaving the department confident in my abilities and with eight more industry qualifications under my belt. I would like to say a huge thank you to all my mentors over the last year! I am unable to put into words how much knowledge and skills I have acquired. My journey with Fresh Egg doesn’t end here however, in October I will be starting an exciting new role within the Marketing and Communications team, as a Marketing Assistant. Charlie Final rotation: Biddable media I started my rotation in Biddable Media on the 15th of May; eager to learn more about arguably the most effective and influential advertising engine the world has ever seen. After immersing ourselves in the AdWords interface and revising Google supplied revision material, the fundamental exams proved no match. In no time we were experiencing the brands that Fresh Egg work with on a regular basis, looking at optimising accounts where we could. Over the period of three and a bit months, and with lots of help from the brilliant Biddable Team, I can happily find my way around otherwise daunting tools, build campaigns and optimise them with a view to increase the visibility of all searches the client desires. I really cannot express in words how thankful I am to all of my mentors over the year (you know who you are!). Not only have you supported my development as a marketer, you've helped me become a better person as well. I look forward to returning to the Tech SEO department this October; the rotation which kicked off this amazing journey. Meg Final rotation: Analytics & insight In May 2016, I began my final rotation in Analytics and Insight. The work I have performed in this department has been completely different to any of the work I have previously completed at Fresh Egg. This has been very useful and has given me a broader knowledge of understanding data and working in Google Analytics. When I first started in this team my main priority was to pass my GAIQ, after a few weeks of solid revision I finally passed and was able to get busy working on client accounts. I have completed a number of tasks within the department; these include insight reports, monthly dashboards, health checks and spot checks. I’ve really enjoyed working within this team as I’ve learnt so much in such a short amount of time. The tasks I found most exciting would be producing health checks, as you can discover a lot about a website and come up with different ways to make improvements. Georgie Final rotation: technical SEO SEO is my final rotation here at Fresh Egg (this year has flown by), and during my time in the team I have had the opportunity to get involved in many hands-on projects, and learn a lot about the department. Starting with the useful, but sometimes tedious, Distilled U modules, I feel I now have the foundations to build on in terms of a working SEO knowledge – I’ve learnt what really goes on behind the scenes of a website that I previously had no idea about. I’ve gained experience in working with SEO specific tools such as Screaming Frog, Ahrefs and Majestic SEO, and now have a clear understanding of what Google looks for in the structural and technical elements of a website. Although each day has been different, there’s always been a tonne to learn. Thank you to everyone who has made my time here at Fresh Egg such a great and rewarding experience. Abbie Final rotation: client services I can’t believe it’s almost over… Client Services has been an amazing experience. Honestly, there has not been a quiet moment, almost to the point that I don’t have time to do my GAIQ but rest assured, I’ll get there. So, what have I been up to? Writing PESTLE analysis Running reports and adding RAGs into Synergist Creating endless Wiki pages Working in collaboration with Lisa on the documenting processes project Creating and formatting endless Trello boards Lots of self-study and exams Competitor research Account time management reporting Changing the passwords (good luck to the poor soul that has to do it when we leave) Creating presentations Listening and taking notes in client calls/meetings I have honestly never met a more supportive bunch than the Client Services team. Despite how nervous I was in doing my first presentation at Fresh Egg, I have never felt more comfortable. They really do get you thinking on your feet, so improvising, handling pressure and keeping calm have never been so important! On that note I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Fresh Egg – for all the time and effort you have put into making me a more knowledgeable and confident person (ignoring the fact it took me three months to pluck up the courage to make a cup of tea). You’ve all been invaluable to the rest of my career… thank you very much.

 The head of Google Doodle says he sees 'Google' in everything Avery Hartmans Sep. 16, 2016, 8:45 AM 1,510 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google Doodle team lead Ryan Germick. Google Ryan Germick describes his job as "a blessing and a curse." The head of the Google Doodle team — and arguably the person with the most fun job at Google — said that while he loves his job, the curse is that everything starts to look like a Doodle.  "Like at the supermarket, the cucumbers and tomatoes are arranged a certain way and I’m like, ‘You know what, if I had a watermelon, that could work as a G,'" Germick told Business Insider. " You start to recognize the pattern and you realize that as arbitrary as the constraint is to have to use the world 'Google' in a piece of illustration or design you’re doing, it actually is a constraint that can inspire a lot of creativity. We’re almost 4,000 Doodles in and there’s no end in sight." Germick says he loves all the Doodles like his own children, but he does have some favorites, like a Doodle with musical instruments where you could create a track and share it with your friends, or the Doodle from Halloween 2015 that was its own candy collection game.  'Unbridled creativity and imagination' Germick is passionate about how important creative expression is for children — and for adults.  "My opinion is that everybody can draw, everybody can dance, everybody can sing," he said. "It’s a crime to deny yourself that; it’s a human thing to express yourself. It’s not really about fancy drawing skill or even being a capital A artist." Germick described growing up as " a process of forgetting to be expressive" and Google's goal is to counteract that and encourage people to be creative throughout their lives.  "The kind of unbridled creativity and imagination that young artists…that just pours out of them, is something that we try very hard to replicate in our professional jobs as creative people," he said. " I never think I’ll run out of inspiration from seeing the individual creative expressions that come out of these young artists." How the Doodle team blows off steam So what does the guy with who might have the most fun at Google do to relax? Nerf basketball.  The Doodle team has a Nerf hoop in its office, which has led to some competitive games — and some heightened rivalries.  "I’m a big Golden State Warriors fan and I just got back from vacation and below the Nerf hoop that we have taped to our office wall very cruelly is now a pretty large wall sticker of LeBron James holding the trophy, taunting me," Germick said. "Right now, it’s gotten personal."

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE) Stock Is a Long-Term Survivor Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) The King of AI After Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Deal? View All Posts Google of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has long dominated online search, indexed million of books, mapped out much of the world and even developed driverless cars. But for all that success, the company just cannot seem to crack social. Source: Open Grid Scheduler Via Flickr Google has a rather long list of social media also-rans, including Orkut, Reader, Wave, and more recently, Buzz, the ill-fated Gmail-based social network that imploded following a catastrophic user policy violation and a class action lawsuit. It’s an open secret that Google’s sole surviving social media platform, Google Plus, has failed to gain any meaningful traction despite the company’s best efforts. Now Google Plus is on life support. GOOGL has continued to diminish attention to the social media platform while simultaneously enhancing services such as YouTube. Last year, Google took the bold step of separating Google Plus profiles from its more popular services, including YouTube. Now Google has announced that Google Plus will stop supporting Hangouts On Air as of Sept. 12 with the broadcast service continuing to exist under YouTube Live. 4 Stocks That Will Accelerate Thanks to Driverless Cars In effect, Google is completely giving up on pitching Google+ as a social media platform. Google Plus Was Doomed to Fail It appears that Google Plus, one of Alphabet’s most epic and expensive failures, was doomed to fail from the get-go. First off, although Google developed the platform in 2010 as a matter of necessity, it did so from a wrong mindset. Google developed Google Plus primarily to serve its need for user data and as a Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) competitor. GOOGL was actually scared that FB was going to eat its lunch and desperately needed to stem the threat. In 2011, Facebook was still a private company valued around $50 billion, much smaller than Google’s own market capitalization of about $200 billion. But Facebook had something Google coveted: a rich cache of data from more than 500 million users. All the while Facebook was busy poaching key Google executives. Alphabet Inc did little to differentiate Google Plus from existing social media sites, and the result was that the platform ended up looking little more than a Facebook clone. The company did outthink Facebook on some aspects, notably Circles, a feature that allows users to better customize the privacy of what they share. But FB was no slouch in the “me-too” game either, and soon introduced a similar feature. In the end, there was little reason for people to switch from FB to Google Plus.

Google Street View is known to blur out faces or number plates to protect privacy but the tech giant took privacy to a whole new level when it obscured the face of a cow in Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The picture of the cow with its face blurred minding its own business on the banks of the River Cam was snapped by Google’s cameras last August. It was highlighted this week by the Guardian’s U.S. Opinion Editor David Shariatmadari. His tweet carrying the picture has been retweeted over 10,000 times and the tweet has received over 13,000 likes so far. The image also drew in a lot of cow jokes. Google Street View’s privacy isn’t absolute when it comes to this cow though. The cow can be viewed in all its glory further down the road but its face was blurred when it came closer to the camera.

Outlook.com now integrates with Google Drive and Facebook photos. Microsoft has long integrated its own OneDrive cloud storage option into Outlook.com and for users who prefer Google Drive this new integration is a big deal. Microsoft notes that its Outlook mobile apps support Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Google Drive is now part of the cloud storage capability at Outlook.com and you can now easily share photos to Facebook from Outlook. To add your Google Drive account to Outlook, the user needs to start a new message and then click the attachment icon. Then select Google Drive and enter account credentials. Once you do that Google Drive will appear as a source for attaching files. Users can browse and select files from a list view or as thumbnails. In the past when users opened Google file types, it happened in a new tab. With the update, you will now see Google Doc, Slide, or Sheet within Outlook just as you see photos. The Google files will open next to your message window so you can keep reading the email. Sharing Facebook photos is the same as setting up Google Drive. You click attachment, choose Facebook, and enter credentials. It’s also easier to find attachments in long conversations. At the top of the thread is an attachment icon, clicking it opens a drop-down list of the attachments in the conversation. These new features are available on migrated Outlook.com accounts on the web. The attachment feature is on Office 365 commercial subscriptions and Outlook on the web. The new features are rolling out over the next few weeks so you may not see then on your account just yet.

X Google’s Dublin data centre goes ‘net zero on waste’ Dublin data centre one of six of tech giant’s facilities with no waste going to landfill Fri, Sep 16, 2016, 12:35 Charlie Taylor Google opened its first data centre in Dublin in 2012. A second data centre opened earlier this year.         Google has said its Dublin-based data centre is one of six facilities worldwide that has successfully managed to ensure that none of its waste goes to landfill. The tech giant, which operates 14 data centres globally, said the Dublin facility, along with sites in Finland, Belgium, Taiwan, Singapore and Oklahoma in the United States, has achieved a 100 per cent diversion rate, with no more than 10 per cent of it going to a waste-to-energy site. Globally, the company is currently diverting at least 86 per cent of waste away from landfills, it said. Zero waste to landfill Google said it was working towards “zero waste to landfill” at all its facilities, and was also seeking to reduce the amount of waste it produces. “Zero waste to landfill is just the first step in a long process to sustainably manage our resources throughout the entire life cycle of our data centres,” it said. Google opened its first data centre in Dublin in 2012. A second data centre opened earlier this year as part of a €150 million investment.       Topics: Dublin(IE) Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Facebook finds three errors in calculating advert effectiveness Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Gaelic Games Ciarán Murphy: Castleknock GAA club prove that sometimes less is more Business Qualtrics in Ireland: ‘Our granny made us come here’ Sponsored HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business European and US stocks fall as dollar hits 13-year high 20:07 Clonmel family seeks removal of receiver over property assets 20:05 Most European indices decline led by falls for banking stocks 19:55 Car finance firm raises €25m for lending 18:43 MetLife to create more than 200 jobs at Galway campus 18:37 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Cow captured on Street View refuses to moo-ve out of the picture Google Street View seems to have taken its privacy policy to the next level after an image of a cow with its features blurred emerged. The image was taken last summer in Cambridge, England, and was discovered by The Guardian’s David Shariatmadari, who highlighted it in a tweet that has been retweeted over 9,000 times. Google Street View launched in 2007 to provide photographic views of streets and countryside all over the world. Google automatically blurs faces and car licence plates to protect privacy but doesn’t normally protect the anonymity of animals. This case has attracted plenty of attention and jokes and terrible puns on social media. A spokesperson for Google told the BBC: “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it’s clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. Of course, we don’t begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame.” @D_Shariatmadari @jonworth Some people think one cow looks much like any udder. Not so! — Tim Bale (@ProfTimBale) September 13, 2016 @D_Shariatmadari was she asked mooove out of the way or was the pic taken on the hoof? — Dave smith (@Powys_power_gat) September 13, 2016 Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Photo credit: @D_Shariatmadari The Guardian’s David Shariatmadari tweeted an image highlighting the cow with blurred face. London, Sep 16:   A cow that had its face blurred by Google Street View has gone viral on social media, prompting the Internet giant to say its face-blurring technology had been “a little overzealous”. The cow was snapped by Google’s cameras at Coe Fen, Cambridge, and seemingly given the same treatment humans receive for privacy reasons. A tweet by The Guardian’s David Shariatmadari highlighting the sight was retweeted more than 9,000 times, the BBC reported. Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously pic.twitter.com/ACTBpDwno6— David Shariatmadari (@D_Shariatmadari) September 13, 2016 Google admitted its face-blurring technology had been “a little overzealous”. The cow’s face can clearly be seen grazing near the river River Cam on an image taken slightly further away, but Google seems to have blurred it for a close-up view. Google’s Street View launched in 2007 and received widespread media coverage as cars mounted with cameras mapped streets around the world. To help combat privacy concerns, software is used to automatically blur human faces. Shariatmadari spotted the bovine anomaly and posted it on Twitter, saying it was “great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously”. “Udderly ridiculous,” said one user in reply. “Google teat view,” said another. It has also been reported by the Cambridge News and national media in Britian. So far the tweet has been liked more than 12,000 times. A spokesman for Google said, “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it’s clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous.” “Of course, we don’t begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame,” the spokesman added.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Chrome for Android Soon to Have Support for Background Media Playback September 16, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts WhatsApp is Finally Offering Added Security via Two-Factor Authentication Bezel-less Screen to Remote Wireless Charging; Apple’s Ground Breaking Technologies for iPhone 8 Thanks to Google’s focus on Windows platform, we finally have the materialistic design standards capsuled in the Windows web version. This came as a part of Google’s extra input on tweaking the Chrome OS and Chrome Windows with version 53 update. But that’s past, as Google is now putting their attention back to rejig Chrome for Android with version 54. As a result, a number of new media-related overhauls are being lined up by the company for its mobile browser, all of which has now been made available in the Chrome for Beta for Android devices. The major revamp is the support for media playback in the background. Users will now be able to listen to audio of media streams in background, which includes instances like switching tabs or when jumping to home screen. Videos will get paused once the aforesaid actions are done, but it will still keep the playback controls alive on the notification bar and users can have the playback resumed from there. Almost all the streaming sites will be compatible with the new background playback, including YouTube. Apart from this, Chrome for Android is also adding support for video orientation, which will now enable direct entry to full screen mode for videos when the device gets rotated. Google is also bringing playback alterations to the desktop version, with embedded YouTube Flash players in the websites being now reworked to adopt the embed style used by HTML5. Besides the new media reshuffles, Chrome for Android will also introduce a new ‘New Tab’ page that will now present suggested articles from Google Now. Other changes made available in the beta version are support for creation of custom elements, support for V1 spec, a new BroadcastChannel API etc. The update will be coming for the stable version by the end of October.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Comments Greenbot | Sep 16, 2016 4:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Android Apps Games Comments When you think of Queen’s iconic “Bohemian Rhapsody,” what pops to mind? Wayne’s World? Maybe next time your brain will go to vivid virtual reality, as Google just released the mesmerizing Bohemian Rhapsody Experience app for Cardboard VR. It leads our latest batch of new Android app and game recommendations, all of which are focused on fun and entertainment. Also new this week is Fox’s Animation Throwdown, which blends several popular cartoon universes for a card-battling game, along with teen-focused live-streaming app, Live.ly. Six! and MyNBA2K17 round out this week’s pack, so if you want to shake up your phone’s app selection with some new options, here’s a good place to start. The Bohemian Rhapsody Experience The Experience gradually transforms and shifts between various scenes and styles. Much like the song itself! “Bohemian Rhapsody” is one of the most instantly recognizable rock songs in history, and now it’s one of the most memorable VR apps for Cardboard. Queen’s classic is the focus of Google’s new app, which concocts a dazzling dream world around the six-minute track. You’ll see odd cartoon creatures, bits of archival video footage, animated versions of the band members, and even dancers and other elements that react based on how you look around. As a 360-degree experience with spatial sound, The Bohemian Rhapsody Experience is best experienced in a Cardboard viewer—but even if you don’t have one of the low-end VR shells, you can still watch the whole thing in full-screen on your device. It’s short and sweet, but as a free showcase for Cardboard and a tribute to an amazing song, it’s well worth checking out.  Animation Throwdown Why are Bob and Bender fighting? No clue, but it’s pretty amusing. Card-based games seem to be all the rage right now in mobile, with Final Fantasy and The Wizard of Oz doing it in recent weeks (among others), but this is a curious one: Animation Throwdown mashes up the universes of Fox’s various adult-focused cartoons for a card-battler. You’ll find cards, characters, and backdrops inspired by Family Guy, Bob’s Burgers, Futurama, King of the Hill, and American Dad within, but sadly nothing from The Simpsons. It doesn’t seem like the most obvious fit for a card combat experience, but from what I’ve played, Animation Throwdown seems solidly fun. The cards dig deep into each show’s catalog for amusing jokes, plus you can stack certain cards for special abilities and permanently fuse cards together to improve your deck between battles. With hundreds of cards, a 25-chapter campaign, and online multiplayer battles, this could be a surprisingly deep time sink. Six! No, this isn’t a Tetris clone, but it is pretty darn fun. Great arcade-style games can be learned within seconds but played (and enjoyed) endlessly, and that seems to be the case with Six! Hailing from Gram Games, which made the popular 1010! and Merged!, it’s a game about gradually clearing away Tetris-like blocks from the screen… all while ensuring that the hexagon sitting atop the heap doesn’t fall to either side. As you create openings below, the hexagon shifts and rolls up top, and any attempt to take things slowly and methodically will be thrown out the window as you frantically try to change its trajectory. Six! is simple yet clever, and quite a bit of fun, plus the free download doesn’t have any limits. However, it does have ad banners and occasional video ads, too. Paying $4 within clears them for good, in case you get sucked in deep. Live.ly I sure hope the teens like watching my cat being annoyed. Have you heard of Musical.ly? It’s a make-your-own-music-video lipsyncing app like the recent Funimate, and it’s hugely popular with teens, racking up more than 100 million downloads across platforms. And that same crowd will surely snap up the company’s latest addition, Live.ly, which already topped the charts over on iOS. Anyone already familiar with live-streaming apps like Periscope or Meerkat will feel right at home. That’s because it’s more or less a teen-centric clone, offering the same kind of interface (with chat and streams of emotes) albeit with a more focused target audience. When I checked it out, the top streams included a girl broadcasting from her desk at school, and some kid’s dog chewing a water bottle—about as riveting as the average fare from other live-streaming apps, really. But the ties into the Musical.ly community may give this an edge with the younger crowd. MyNBA2K17 Yes, those are basketball cards playing basketball. NBA 2K17 tips off on consoles today, and 2K Sports’ annual basketball sim just seems to get better every year. We’ll probably get an Android version of the full game at some point, as we did with NBA 2K16 ($8)—but for now, hoops fans can check out MyNBA2K17. Like last year’s game, it’s an odd little amalgamation of basketball and a collectible card game (like Animation Throwdown above), as 2K has also done with WWE SuperCard and NHL SuperCard. You’ll bring a small deck onto the court in the brief battles, picking your best card for each matchup and trying to beat the opposing team. All the while, the cards dribble and shoot the ball, which is as surreal as it is totally hilarious. MyNBA2K17 also serves as a companion app for the main game, letting you earn in-game currency and scan your face to create custom athletes in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.

The technology, which is being provided free online so members of the public can monitor the oceans for activity, is aimed at combating overfishing around the world. Fish stocks in many parts of the world are perilously low after being over exploited and despite international agreements on what can be caught, many are still overfished illegally. Scroll down for video  Google has teamed up with two conservation groups and actor Leonardo DiCaprio to create technology that allows the public to monitor the activity of commercial fishing vessels around the world (pictured). It uses satellite, radar and transponder data HOW THE TRACKER WORKS  Currently, Global Fishing Watch does not include every vessel on the ocean, only those that broadcast data from the Automatic Identification System, collected by satellite and terrestrial receivers. It was initially designed mainly as a safety mechanism to avoid collisions. Many of the world's largest fishing vessels are required by the International Maritime Organization to use AIS. But AIS can be turned off if the boat operator is doing something illegal. However, such on-off actions would likely be apparent by tracing the boat's appearing and disappearing tracks. This can help to highlight illegal activity. Future versions of the technology may even include tagging data for marine animals, so that the paths of whales and sharks and other fish might be visible alongside the vessel activity. This could help to reveal if vessels are targetting vulnerable stocks. The technology, called Global Fishing Watch, is designed to provide an eye in the sky that constantly searches for this activity. By providing the information free online, marine conservation campaigners hope citizens will be able to play their part in looking for illegal activity. 'This unprecedented technology is available to everyone in the world,' DiCaprio said at the launch of the software at the US State Department in Washington. 'This platform will empower citizens across the globe to become powerful advocates for our oceans.' Around two thirds of global fish stocks are overexploited or depleted according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Illegal fishing is estimated to account for 35 per cent of the global wild marine catch and causes yearly losses of £17.7 billion ($23.5 billion). Some of the planet's largest fish, including tuna and swordfish, now have populations that are below 10 per cent of their historical level. Using satellite technology combined with radar aboard boats, the new platform allows people to trace the paths of 35,000 commercial fishing vessels in almost real time.

Share this article Share 242 shares Actor Leonardo DiCaprio (right), who is a strong campaigner for the environment, unveiled the new project at the US State Department along with US Secretary of State John Kerry (left) Dedicated: The actor at the announcement By focusing on areas of interest they should also be able to spot vessels operating there illegally. The $10 million project has been set up by three partner groups – Google, environmental imaging non-profit SkyTruth and marine conservation group Oceana. Actor DiCaprio has long been a campaigner for the environment and last week premiered a new documentary about climate change. His Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation is one of the main financial backers of the Global Fishing Watch project, after it put in £4.54 million ($6 million). The system allows information like protected marine areas, territorial waters and the country that vessels are from to be visualised (pictured). In the example above the Spanish fleet is in blue, the Japanese in green and the Korean in red The technology uses the Automatic Identification System carried by large fishing vessels to track their location (illustrated). This means suspicious activity can be carefully monitored. In the past it was rarely noticed if these were turned off but the new project will highlight this Since 1999 his foundation has channelled £45 million ($59.6 million) into projects to protect vulnerable wildlife and ecosystems. Global Fishing Watch is being an attempt to crowdsource the fight against illegal fishing. Jacqueline Savitz, vice president for US oceans at Oceana, said the platform will 'revolutionise the way the world views commercial fishing.' She said it could provide vital data for governments to monitor and enforce fishing restrictions, for journalists investigating suspicious activity and for the public to help track illegal activity. However, the data will be provided by satellite company Orbcomm with a three day delay, meaning it will not be possible to use it to instantly catch any criminals. The technology can reveal that vessels from all around the world can cluster in fishing areas, such as around South Georgia Island in the example pictured  The online software also highlights protected marine areas (shown in green above) and highlights when vessels are operating within their borders 'We think it is going to have a lot of impact, first of all just the deterrent effect of vessels knowing that we could see them if they are doing something they are not supposed to be doing,' Ms Savitz said. For instance, users could zero in on a marine protected area and see if any boat tracks have crossed into waters where they should not have been. One could scan the map for any evidence that large vessels are fishing in areas that are reserved for small-scale fishermen. Overfishing is a growing problem around the world, with about two-thirds of fish stocks in the high seas either over exploited or depleted (stock image) Vessels can be tracked by name or by country, or by traffic inside exclusive economic zones. The paths of ships are visible, including zigzag paths that could indicate vessels are avoiding shore to offload their catch on to other ships undetected, or that other illegal operations or human rights abuses may be under way. Already, the government of Kiribati has used Global Fishing Watch data to unmask illegal fishing in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, declared off-limits to commercial fishing on January 1, 2015.

Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40.

Then the billboards all over highway 101 about the nano-degree in self-driving by Sebastian Thrun's Udacity It's astonishing the tempo that this has taken and accelerating... » reply ... but Apple also picked up an entire company's worth of PhDs Submitted by David Rostcheck (not verified) on Mon, 2016-08-22 08:52. Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22. Hi, have you heard any news on tesla negotiating with a global mapmaker? I heard it here (webinar on high definition maps) http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation/automot... » reply Taxi model Submitted by Bejoy (not verified) on Mon, 2016-09-12 02:45. Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

By Nick Heath | September 16, 2016, 2:15 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus A close up of one of D-Wave's quantum processors. Image: Google / YouTube We may be decades from unlocking the true power of quantum computing, but D-Wave is promising to offer a taste of the future with its significantly upgraded quantum processor. When it is released early next year, the Canadian firm's new quantum chip will be able to handle some 2,000 quantum bits (qubits), roughly double the usable number found in the processor in the existing D-Wave 2X system, and be capable of solving certain problems 1,000x faster than its predecessor. D-Wave machines are multi-million dollar computers that crunch data using "quantum transistors", tiny loops of niobium cooled to close to absolute zero by liquid helium. Only a handful of such systems are in use, run by Google and the Universities Space Research Association, Lockheed Martin and Los Alamos National Laboratory. However, D-Wave also offers access to its quantum computers via a cloud service. SEE: Quantum computing: The smart person's guide Quantum computing is still a largely theoretical field, which studies how to exploit the bizarre and counter-intuitive way that matter behaves at an atomic level to develop hugely powerful machines. For certain tasks, quantum computers have the potential to be exponentially faster than existing systems, as well as being vastly more energy efficient. While a universal quantum computer doesn't yet exist, the D-Wave system utilises various atomic behaviors, such as entanglement and state superposition, to help solve a range of difficult computational problems.

"We've been on a trajectory, which has been doubling the number of qubits pretty much every year," said Colin Williams, director of business development and strategic partnerships at D-Wave. Bumping up the qubits on the D-Wave processor moves the systems closer to being able to challenge conventional computers, and the new processor will also support additional features that allow for more efficient calculations. "From an internal tests, that looks like that's a really good thing to do. We've got some problems we've already sped up by a factor of 1,000 by exploiting that capability," said Williams at the CW TEC conference in Cambridge. D-Wave systems are not universal computers, as is the case with PCs today. Rather than being capable of performing any computational task asked of them, D-Wave machines are designed to tackle a specific task known as unconstrained binary optimization, as well as related sampling problems. A very simple example of this type of optimization problem might be the challenge of drawing up a plan for a house that comes as close to your dream spec as possible, while staying within your budget. The specialized work that the D-Wave processor can carry out could be useful in a number of areas, according to D-Wave, particularly training machine learning models. However, there are still significant obstacles to the larger challenge of building a universal quantum computer, with several unresolved engineering challenges. By extrapolating from past trends in chip development, John Morton, professor of nanoelectronics and nanophotonics at UCL, predicts the first universal quantum processor won't be built until the 2030s. Morton said that just as a calculator isn't a computer, so the D-Wave system isn't a universal quantum computer. "A calculator solves a very specific set of problems. Lots of people use it, and you can use calculators across many different industries," he said. "So when D-Wave shows you many different industries that might use a D-Wave machine, there may be many areas that it can be used in, but it remains a specialized device." While Google isn't using the D-Wave machine to bolster its machine-learning efforts as of yet, the credibility of D-Wave's processors — which has been repeatedly challenged by some academics — was given a boost by a test run by the technology giant late last year. The experiment found that the D-Wave 2X processor was 100 million times faster than a classical processor running a similar operation, but more importantly it demonstrated the future viability of D-Wave's chips, according to Williams. "The main takeaway from that wasn't really a speed up result, because there are other classical algorithms that can do better," he said. "That experiment showed the quantum tunnelling really was occurring in the D-Wave chip. It showed that even if the range of that tunnelling is finite, it is a useful computational tool. "Google understood, as do we, that as we evolve the design of our chip to make it more densely connected, then the classical algorithms that currently work well for this problem will completely fall apart." D-Wave has raised millions of dollars in funding from various investors, including investment bank Goldman Sachs, In-Q-Tel (the investment arm of the US Central Intelligence Agency), Bezos Expeditions (the investment arm of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos), and BDC Capital, Harris & Harris Group, and DFJ. A machine that can speak like a human Another criticism of the D-Wave's chip is that its specialized nature limits its usefulness, something that Williams rejects. "I wanted to put to rest the idea that the D-Wave chip only does one thing, it's actually been shown that the one thing it does, can be used in lots of different fields," he said. While not naming the organizations that had used D-Wave chips in this way, he said the processors had been used in the financial sector for trading trajectory optimization, to work out how proteins fold in bioscience, to create filters for lists that never miss a potential match — useful for security services checking terrorist watchlists, for development of binary classifiers in AI and for computer vision. But it is unsupervised machine learning, where training data is fed into a neural network and the machine learns by identifying patterns, where Williams believes the D-Wave processor will make the greatest impact, perhaps explaining Google's interest in the technology. "We think that machine learning and AI are fundamentally the best use cases for this kind of machine. It has the potential to be completely revolutionary, especially for unsupervised generative learning," he said. "With the quantum chip, we have the potential to go back and address the original, grand challenging problem of machine learning - 'How do you get unsupervised, generative machine learning to work as efficiently as you can?'. "If you can do that, you can do amazing things with machine learning. You can make a machine that, having trained it, you can make it generate new data that is statistically indistinguishable from the kind of data on which it was trained." Williams predicted future generations of D-Wave chips that could train machines to produce new and convincing works of art in the style of the master painter whose work it was trained on or to be capable of human-like speech, he said. D-Wave has already experimented with machine learning on the chip, setting up a Boltzmann machine, a type of stochastic recurrent neural network, as well as a "Quantum Boltzmann machine", which Williams said is 'fundamentally different from previous machine learning models'. Williams doesn't see the D-Wave chip, or other quantum processors, that might follow as replacing classical computer chips, but as working alongside them. "We recognise that it's not going to be the case that quantum computing replaces classical machines. The way quantum computing is going to change the world is it's going to augment classical systems," he said. "For example, you could take the output of a quantum computer and use that as an input to a heuristic search algorithm. The idea is that the quantum algorithm could get you in the vicinity of a good solution and a classical algorithm could finish it off. "We can also look at pre-processing techniques, to take a problem that is too big, put it on the quantum chip and break it down into a sequence of problems." Beyond the 2000 qubit processor, Williams says that D-Wave has a design for a "next-generation chip" with a "fundamentally new topology, based on all the lessons we've learnt". More details on the new D-Wave chip (for those with a grasp of quantum physics) For those interested in the nitty gritty, Williams spoke in more depth about the new capabilities in its 2,000 qubit chip. Each D-Wave processor is designed for quantum annealing, using quantum physics to find a minimum energy state, which is useful in solving the optimization and related sampling problems mentioned above. Williams explained how the new chip will offer greater control of the annealing process. "It's not just more qubits, we've changed a lot of other features too. On the previous D-Wave chips we only had the ability to look at one annealing trajectory. We've only been able to essentially turn off the initial Hamiltonian and turn on the final Hamiltonian one way," he said, referencing a Hamiltonian formula that is able to output the energy within a system when given the state of that system. "That's no longer true, with the 2,000 qubit chip, we're going to have a lot more control over parameters, we're going to have a lot more control over the trajectory. "From internal tests, that looks like that's a really good thing to do. We've got some problems we've already sped up by a factor of 1,000 by exploiting that capability. "We also have features for pausing the anneal and then ramping it quickly to the end, you don't have to anneal at a constant speed anymore. "That's very interesting, because it allows you to probe the quantum state in the middle of the anneal, which is a critical feature from the point of Quantum Boltzmann Machines. "We also have a faster annealing, previous generations of systems could only anneal down to 20 microseconds. With the new system we can anneal down to five microseconds."

Google has responded in a gloriously puntastic manner, by saying in a statement: “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it’s clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. “Of course, we don’t begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame.” #cowgate commendations to @google for their protection of the Cambridgeshire's cow's true identity. pic.twitter.com/3pkEOe6qss— Adrian Hayes (@adrianhayes) September 16, 2016 A Google Street View car (Paul Sakuma/AP) The animal was captured by Google’s cameras at Coe Fen, Cambridge, and given the same privacy rights as humans receive.

The Google Street View's face-blurring typically blurs license plates and human faces, but it was an editor for the Guardian that recently discovered it also respects the privacy of cows. A black cow near the River Cam at Coe Fen in Cambridge was afforded a moment of privacy that it didn't have seconds earlier in a photos taken from farther away. "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous," a Google spokesperson said in a statement. The image originally tweeted by Guardian opinion editor David Shariatmadari has been retweeted more than 9,000 times and inspired a lot of cow-based humor along with it.

So serious that Google's doesn't want thing to leave to chance, especially at a time when in a country as important as India the reverence for cows is on an upswing. So recently when the company's algorithms encountered a handsome bovine, the AI overlords -- that is artificial intelligence in plainspeak -- at the company decided to respect the full privacy of the cow blurred its face. Although, this cow was grazing on a street in the UK and not India but surely many here would appreciate the sentiment. After all if humans deserve privacy, cows surely do too. The blurred cow's photo, which soon went viral, was posted on Twitter. Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously pic.twitter.com/ACTBpDwno6â€” David Shariatmadari (@D_Shariatmadari) September 13, 2016 Also, you can see the cow in the Google Street view by visiting this link While this is all very nice -- and hilarious -- it is also an overzealous Google AI at work. The same cow had its face all sharp and in focus in earlier frames that Google's Street View cameras captured. Although this is not the first time Google's AI has erred on the side of caution. Since the company rolled out this tool to blur faces of people in a bid to address Street View privacy concerns, we have seen again and again all types of faces getting blurred. For example, there were images of billboards full of movie stars that all had their faces blurred by the Google Street View AI. BBC, meanwhile, reached out to Google, seeking a comment on this moos-worthy issue. Here is what a Google spokesperson said: "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous... Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame."

News Stocks Technology Science Health Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsThe Race to Cloud Computing Dominance has Begun and Google (GOOGL) Scores BIG The Race to Cloud Computing Dominance has Begun and Google (GOOGL) Scores BIG Amazon is the company to beat in the cloud computing segment but Google is not far behind thanks to this win. September 16, 2016 WSP Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is leading in the cloud computing segment and investing more in the industry “could prove to be huge” for the company according to veteran analyst Bill Miller, but don’t count out Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) just yet. The search engine giant sealed a significant deal that could take it one step closer to market domination: Google just won Evernote as a customer. According to a report, Google has won the contract against other bidders, which many believe include Amazon Web Services. Before coming to Google’s cloud, Evernote had its own servers in its own data center. The win is significant for Google because the cross-platform app has over 200 million users. Evernote is reportedly keeping billions of notes and approximately 5 billion attachments, all of which could be useful to the Mountain View, California-based company. Google’s win goes against the usual model of managing a business, which starts in the cloud and then maintaining a data center once the business grows bigger. According to Diane Greene, Google’s head of cloud computing, more companies will start following Evernote’s lead. Amazon was the first to see the changes happening, with the growing number of companies going completely on its cloud and shutting down their data centers. Greene said that Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU), a company where she is a board member, has gone in the same direction. Winning Evernote is the first victory for Google’s push to turn to the cloud. “You just couldn’t begin to do what we do in our data centers with our scale. We spent $10 billion in capex last year,” Greene says. She explained that Google makes the perfect partner for Evernote because the former can offer better security. Greene says Google has over 650 full-time security experts. Google’s cloud computing services are the most affordable in the market. Because of the very low price tag on its cloud services, naysayers believe that Google is more interested in increasing the number of its customers rather than generate more revenues and profits from cloud deals. Meanwhile, Evernote has been focused on cutting costs. But Greene said Google won the contract because it has a lot of benefits to offer Evernote. Speaking at the Disrupt tech conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Greene said, “They’ll be able to innovate faster, partnered with us innovating on the backend for them.” And this, Greene said, is Google’s main strategy for dominating the cloud segment and surpass Amazon, which earns the top spot in the cloud industry. Google believes that it can develop cloud computing into an even larger industry than its internet ad business. As for naysayers, Greene has this to say: “I think it’s how we partner with customers. Engineer to engineer. Good engineer to good engineer.” This means, apart from selling products to companies, Google is also providing access to the company’s pool of talented engineers. Google is notorious for hiring only the best, brightest, and most talented engineers in the business and this, Greene said, is one thing that its rivals cannot offer.

Gozo News.Com Navigation Menu Home Gozo News Malta News EU News Financial News Letters & Opinions Gozo News Be the first to comment! Google Street View cars to begin driving Malta’s roads from Monday by Gozo News · September 16, 2016  Email item  Print item Google Inc. headquartered in California U.S., announced today that it will start driving through Gozo and Malta to improve the quality of Google Maps and collect imagery for its popular Street View feature. From Monday, Google cars will begin driving and taking 360 degree photographs of many locations throughout Gozo Malta, including heritage and touristic attractions such as the coastal area. Street View is a hugely popular feature of Google Maps which was launched in May 2007 and is currently available across 77 countries. It allows users to virtually explore and navigate a neighbourhood through panoramic street-level images. Google plans to start driving in Valletta, and will soon expand to other cities and villages. In total, it is planned to cover as much as possible of the road network starting from 19th September until the end of October. Google said that driving schedules often depend on various factors like weather, road closures, etc. Therefore permanent updates on Street View car locations as well as general information about Street View will be provided on the website as soon as driving starts. Images collected will be processed and carefully stitched together, a technological process that can take several months. Users will be able to explore the imagery at a later date on Google Maps. Google said that it applies state-of-the-art technology to help identify and blur individual faces and licence plates on any imagery before it is made public. "Once Street View imagery is available online, users can ask for further blurring," it said. Reporting an issue can be done by just clicking or tapping "Report a problem" in the bottom-right of the image window or in Google Maps app, from the flag or menu buttons.

Sep 16th 2016, 10:02 AM 26,671 Views 37 Comments Share491 Tweet Email2 Image: Google Street View SINCE IT CAPTURES images of public spaces, Google Street View usually blurs out the faces of people and number places to protect people’s identities. It uses software to do this automatically, but sometimes it can go a step too far as one unsuspecting animal found out. When capturing street view images in a park in Cambridge last summer, Google’s software decided to blur out the face of a cow which wandered onto the path. The action was spotted by The Guardian’s Opinion Editor David Shariatmadari. Its face is only blurred at that particular point, moving up or down the path will reveal the cow’s face, undoing the software’s hard work.

Microsoft’s Gmail Killer Adds Support for Google Drive GO Outlook.com gets new options in latest update Sep 16, 2016 08:56 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft has just rolled out an important update for Outlook.com that makes it easier for users to send attachments and photos, but also to find pictures in long conversations a lot faster. First and foremost, the most important improvement is the addition of Google Drive support. This means that users of Microsoft’s email service can now connect directly to Google Drive and attach files from their accounts without leaving the email interface. All you have to do is click on the attachment icon in Outlook.com, select Google Drive, provide your credentials, and then browse your account to choose the photos you want to attach. Furthermore, the new update makes it possible to open Google documents straight from Outloook.com and you can see both the file and the email you were writing side by side in the same window. (Check out the screenshot included in the article to see how this feature works.) “Now, when you receive a Google Doc, Slide or Sheet, you can open the file within Outlook. Just like photos and Office file types, the Google files open in Outlook next to your message window so your work flow is not disrupted. And, as with Google Drive links, if you have edit permissions, you’ll be able to edit using the full functionality available on Google Drive - again, all without leaving Outlook,” Microsoft explains. Facebook photo support Facebook support is also added with this new update, and it works in a similar way with Gmail, but this time you can easily attach only your photos to emails without leaving the Outlook.com screen. Last but not least, Microsoft is also making it easier to view all attachments in a certain conversation thanks to a new attachment icon included in every thread that lets you view all files that you or your contacts previously sent. Clicking on a certain file lets you instantly open it in Outlook.com. These new features will be rolled out over the next few weeks, Microsoft says, so not everyone is getting them from the very beginning, although they should show up in your account very soon. #Microsoft#Gmail#Google Drive#Outlook.com#Outlook subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Trashes Google in New Edge vs. Chrome Browser Benchmarks Microsoft Kills the Top Calendar App for the iPhone Samsung Wants Windows Phone Users to Switch to Its Galaxy Android Devices Microsoft Removes YouTube App for Windows Phone Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

In that time I also thought that we deal with this very often when looking at say products on Amazon or almost any other site where people post reviews. How do you sort out opinions when one person says the Fizzbit 300xJ is the best thing since butter and someone else says it’s a ripoff? I also saw this on a recipe site, which can either be perfect or not work, depending who you are: The thing about reviews… pic.twitter.com/pMQBfBHf22 — Alan Levine (@cogdog) April 24, 2016 But I also realized (slaps head) this is what we have to do (or ought to be doing) with search results. How lucky is it to go with I Feel Lucky? A few clicks back I was looking for a technical answer. I decided to create a Google Account for the UDG Agora Project (so all its hangouts could be in one YouTube account, and to schedule them all there). It seemed sensible to (if possible) move some videos I made last year to this new channel, ones that are in my personal account. I was not feeling to optimistic (Google you so fickle with features) but searched on how to transfer a video from one youtube account to another. The results… The first one, the golden I Feel Lucky one kind of puts a pillow over my hopeful face: Similarly, you can’t transfer data from one channel to another (this includes videos). However, you can download your videos from your own channel. Once you’ve downloaded your video, you can re-upload it to a different channel. View count and other statistics will start over for the new upload. It says, no you cannot transfer videos from one channel to another. The suggestion is tedious, download your video and re-upload. The second result, from the IT department at Stonybrook University, also tells me, with abundant screen shots, to either request a Google Takeout (can I get fries with that?) of ALL my videos or download ’em one by one. My hunch says the mp4 download will be degraded too. Now here is where my memory unfraggles. When I did this search 2 weeks ago, the video in the 3rd result spot showed me the method I used. My Mr Kent’s video there now, is just another download approach. I see the answer now at result number 5 SOLVED: How to Easily Move A Video From One Youtube Account To Another… Make sure the source video has it’s license set to Creative Commons– I may use this little video trailer for our online collaboration space. Now I know why this setting is valuable. Stay tuned. Go to the account where you want to transfer the video TO (i have it in another window). Click the remix button… yikes, now there is no remix button! I swear there was one before. Switch gears. Okay, in the destination account, open the YouTube Video editor (which again, Google, in its never out of beta design, does not seem to have a link directly in its YouTube interface). Paste the URL of the source video in the Search videos box- it should find the video, and present it as an icon (if it does not turn up, my guess is the license is not set to creative commons or Google again changed the way it works). Drag the video to the box where it says… “drag this video” If you have never used this editor, you may be in for a surprise. You could trim sections, or combine with other clips. You can change the audio track. And add text. You can only edit your own clips or others that are license Creative Commons./li> But we are just doing a simple remix/copy. You can change it’s title from “Me Edited Video” to something that means something. But this editor let’s you do a “remix” where it’s an outright copy (which is ok because of the license). But it ends up in the new account. It should only take a few minutes. But this approach is easier IMHO than downloading and re-uploading. But now the video that originally was on my account at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6Gei4ayE8I is now on the UDG Agora account at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3IbT1EQAXM… when Google sang to me it could not be done. I will add that the result that leads to Quora does provide a discordant chorus in its own space. The top results summarizes the method that works (although it is now off because there is no “remix button”). The second result, from a YouTube Product Manager says it cannot be done (WRONG), and actually the rest of the chorus sings along “It cannot be done”. But it can. The question is, how much do you spend trying to find the “right” singer in the chorus? I would look to the answers that says it can be done before concluding it cannot. Top / Featured Image : I started searching Google Images (results set to licensed for reuse only, as one does) (this one) (despite the insane discrepancy in results) on “two singers”, but making it “duet” had better results. I really wanted singers that maybe looked like they were not singing together, but these ravens were just too cute.

Noodling about in the mess and then pulling up a fish. Loose narrative from the chorus. Kitchen table federation where the kitchen table is the Net and where the federation is whoever the question attracts. Thanks for the splainification. Even if I had no particular use for this particular Google-ality, it would still be useful. Sandy September 16, 2016 at 10:10 am Reply Times like this, posts like this, teach me a question I may someday have to ask…and I’ll remember there was an answer and 10 to 1 I’ll think to search your site for an answer!

Best Before labels – with patch cut-off dates IoT insecurity: US govt summons tech bosses, bashes heads together CloudFlare Internet Summit As internet engineer jokes go, Google's Ilya Grigorik came up with a good one. On stage to answer the question "what can we expect from the internet in 2020?", he offered: As far as I can tell, by 2020, we will have flying cars, singularity... and IPv6. It's an amusing but pointed stab at the fundamental internet protocol that was created 20 years ago and still stubbornly refuses to be adopted. Something to do with the geniuses at the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) deciding not to make it backwards compatible with IPv4. But, despite the long, long delay, Google and Grigorik are starting to get optimistic about IPv6. "In the last three years, we have seen its use double every year," noted Google's web performance engineer, swiftly getting ahead of the obvious retort, "yes, from 0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent to 0.4." But in truth, we are now seeing over 50 per cent use of IPv6 over mobile networks, and Google sees it used in 10 per cent of cases across the whole internet. That should bring with it a whole new class of apps, Grigorik enthused. But what he really wanted to talk about was Google's replacement for another veteran internet protocol: TCP. TCP and its brother IP are the reason billions of us get to enjoy the internet we do today, but it is also old and, in Grigorik's words, "ossified." Google's answer is QUIC – its version of UDP and standing for Quick UDP Internet Connection. Google started pushing QUIC last year and in that time, Grigorik said, it has been able to create "20 to 30 iterations of it – which allows us to innovate." TCP? Not so much. QUIC's big advantage is in real-time apps, and it's faster and more reliable than TCP because it's not dependent on the operating system. And while talking about replacing and updating the old protocols that we have built the internet on, Grigorik is also keen on HTTP/2. It has been out there for over a year (RFC 7540) and can boast significant improvement on the protocol we have all come to know (and love?). "HTTP/2 addresses the limitations of the previous protocol that was design to fetch documents," Grigorik noted. "Today, the internet delivers applications and that means lots of connections and handshakes [over HTTP] that are unnecessary." Google has seen significant improvements using HTTP/2 – not something that users will necessary notice but which internet infrastructure companies definitely do. "We've seen improvements of up to 30 to 50 per cent," he said. As for the everyday internet in 2020, Grigorik predicts more bandwidth, and latency down "a little." Uncontroversially, he expects there to be billions of new users online and he expects them to enjoy the sort of speeds that those of us in the developed world enjoy currently, but with the developed world leaping ever ahead – faster and faster. The digital gap is going nowhere, it's just that everyone will be better off. As for CloudFlare's CTO John Graham-Cumming, he thinks the big change by 2020 will be in encryption. "I think we'll find that unencrypted protocols will be pariahs," he predicted. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 64 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Only a handful of startups ever enjoy being in everyday conversations worldwide. Googling and Ubering have become perhaps the two strongest according to IDriveWithUber. YouTube Video . One must ask, will there ever be a linguistic merger of Google and Uber? Perhaps something like Googuber [ Goo-goo-ber ]? - The "act of Googling while Ubering".     LOS ANGELES, CA, September 16, 2016 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Conversations are a part of life. They are natural, yet sometimes spontaneous. Over the years, and with the growth of the Internet, Google quickly became more than just a search engine. It became a way of life. It was engrained in conversation. It became a verb. Something isn't just found on a search engine, it's 'googled'. In conversation, questions arise, answers are 'googled'. The latest verb to be born is 'to uber'. Uber, the online transportation network, came to the scene in 2009 and has quickly become a convenient way of transportation. Very few people are referencing to calling a cab or a ride, most are saying they will 'uber' there. People travel, party, have cars that break down, or need a quick ride from point A to point B. It is now commonplace to use the 'uber' term as a way of life, and just 'uber' there. Uber would not be successful, if it weren't for the drivers. Passengers would not be growing in numbers if the app was not up to par. With the growth of riders, the need for more drivers increases as well. Headline News Guru 'googled' what it takes to become an Uber driver, and what sites people are frequenting in order to do just that. Quite a few sites popped up, obviously Uber's website itself, but another website stood out. IDriveWithUber.com has countless articles with information regarding the rideshare world, and blog posts on tips for drivers. IDriveWithUber recently created a YouTube channel - thank you Google - to help create a visual way of finding more information. Check out their video on how much Uber drivers can make. This article was written after 'googling' (actually a word now in the dictionary) information previously discussed in conversation with co-workers, and while 'ubering' (not yet in the dictionary) to the office. One must ask, will there ever be a linguistic merger of Google and Uber? Perhaps something like Googuber [ Goo-goo-ber ]? - The "act of Googling while Ubering". I Drive With Uber (IDWU) is committed to providing a reliable platform with comprehensive information for everyone interested in participating in the emerging rideshare world. At I Drive with Uber we aggregate and organize valuable information and tools for the Rideshare Community, for both users and drivers, and conveniently present it in one online meeting place (IDWU). # # # Comment on this story...

Every institution in America is sold out, corrupted and politically rigged to favor Big Government and Big Business. “America is a lost country,” explains Paul Craig Roberts. “The total corruption of every public and the private institution is complete. Nothing remains but tyranny. And lies. Endless lies.” CNN, Reuters and the Associated Press are all now shameless promoters of every big lie across every sector of society, from vaccines and GMOs to elections and politics. The federal government itself is incapable of doing anything other than lying, and it has totally corrupted the entire realm of science by pulling the strings of funding via the National Institutes of Health and the NSF. The FDA is entirely corrupt, as is the USDA. Both function now as little more than marketing propaganda pushers for Big Pharma and Big Biotech. Similarly, Google, Facebook and Twitter are all rigged, too, censoring the voices they don’t want anyone to hear while highlighting the establishment lies they wish to promote. Here’s what “rigged” really means… the tools of tyranny When I say “everything is rigged,” what does that mean, exactly? • All “official sources” are ordered to constantly lie about everything, weaving illusions to push a chosen narrative rooted in fiction (from “there are no Islamic terrorists” to “carbon dioxide is poison to the planet”). • All voices of reason and sanity are silenced. Only the most insane, irrational voices are allowed to be magnified through any media (including social media). This is also true across the sciences, where real science has been all but snuffed out by political agendas (biosludge, GMOs, glyphosate, mercury in dentistry, etc.). • All facts are obliterated by propaganda. Facts have no place in any debate, and those who invoke facts are shamed and silenced (or even fired from their jobs, expelled from their schools or bullied into a state of suicide on social media). Anyone who invokes facts on things like the actual statistics of police shootings is told they are “part of the problem” because they have the “wrong attitude” about social justice. • Every branch of government is weaponized against the people and used as an assault tool against political enemies who threaten the status quo. (IRS, FDA, FTC, DEA, EPA, USDA, etc.) • All science is distorted into absurd, politically-motivated conclusions about everything the government wants to use to control the masses: Vaccines, climate change, GMOs, fluoride, flu shots, chemical agriculture, carbon dioxide and so on. • Every branch of medicine is hijacked by globalist agendas to make sure medicine never makes anyone healthier, more alert or more cognitively capable of thinking for themselves. • Every “news item” that’s reported from any official source is deliberately distorted to the point of insanity, turning many facts on their heads while attacking anyone who might offer something truly constructive to the world. (Such as reporting that Clinton was “cleared” by the FBI when, in fact, she was indicted by the very facts the FBI presented!) • All voices of truth are silenced, then replaced by meaningless, distracting babble (Kardashians) or meaningless, tribal sports competitions (the Rio Olympics). The point is to dumb down the entire population to the point of cultural lunacy. • Any true reports that contradict any official narrative are immediately censored. For example, radio host Michael Savage just got blocked by Facebook for posting a true story about an illegal alien who committed murder in America. • Emotions are used as weapons to manipulate the masses. For example, when the mom of a Benghazi victim shares her grief with the world, she is ridiculed and shamed. But when a radical Muslim father who’s trying to bring Sharia Law to America attacks Trump by expressing his loss of his soldier son, the media turns him into an instant celebrity, praising his “courageous voice” for daring to speak out. The media hypocrisy is enough to make you vomit… What exactly is rigged? • The entire mainstream media • Google search engine and Google News • Facebook and Twitter • The DNC and the RNC (both 100% rigged by globalists) • Every federal agency (EPA, FDA, etc.) • The entire justice system (makes a total farce of real justice) • Interest rates and the value of the money supply (central banksters) • Academia (all public universities) • EPA’s “safe” limits on pesticides (all rigged by Big Biotech) • Food and food labeling (all run by corrupt food companies) • Public education (rigged into Common Core anti-knowledge idiocy) • Banking and finance (all controlled by globalists) • Government economics figures and statistics • Medicine and pharmaceuticals (rigged to maximize profits) • Big Science (totally rigged by government agenda pushers) • The music industry (most top singers can’t sing at all) • Weapons manufacturers and war corporations • The illegal drug trade (it’s run by the government) • Political elections (all 100% rigged at the federal level) • Political polls (now rigged by Reuters, too) • The health insurance industry (rigged by Obamacare) • College admissions (legally discriminates against Whites and Asians) • 9/11 and domestic terrorism (all rigged “official stories”) • Oil and energy industries • The rule of law (rigged in favor of the rich and powerful) • Infectious disease and the CDC (a constant stream of lies) • Hollywood (all run by globalists) • Climate change science (all a grand science hoax) • Press release services (they only allow official narratives) • History (what you are taught is mostly a lie) • Government grants (only given out to those who further the agenda) • Government bids (only awarded to those who kick back funds to corrupt officials) • Consciousness and free will (we are all taught consciousness doesn’t exist) • Ethnobotany (medicinal and spiritual use of healing plants) • Life on other plants (the obvious truth is kept from us all) • The origin of the universe (the official narrative is a laughable fairy tale) As a fantastic example of how everything is rigged, consider these paragraphs from this Breitbart.com news story published today: Over the weekend and for the past few days since Khan spoke alongside his wife Ghazala Khan about their son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004, media-wide reporters, editors, producers, and anchors have tried to lay criticism on Trump over the matter. They thought they had a good one, a specific line of attack that pitted Trump against the military—and supposedly showed him as a big meanie racist in the process. But, as Breitbart News showed on Monday midday, that clearly was not the case. Khizr Khan has all sorts of financial, legal, and political connections to the Clintons through his old law firm, the mega-D.C. firm Hogan Lovells LLP. That firm did Hillary Clinton’s taxes for years, starting when Khan still worked there involved in, according to his own website, matters “firm wide”—back in 2004. It also has represented, for years, the government of Saudi Arabia in the United States. Saudi Arabia, of course, is a Clinton Foundation donor which—along with the mega-bundlers of thousands upon thousands in political donations to both of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2016—plays right into the “Clinton Cash” narrative. America’s transformation into Communist China is nearly complete If you’re pondering where all this is headed, look no further than Communist China, where all independent news has been outlawed by the state. Political prisoners across China have their organs harvested to enrich black market organ traders, and nearly one out of every three urban citizens is a secret spy who snitches on friends for the totalitarian communist government. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of Communist Chinese totalitarianism. She’s such a perfect fit for their disastrous model of human rights abuses, government corruption and systemic criminality that I’m surprised she doesn’t live in Beijing. If Clinton gets elected, America is gone forever, replaced by a criminal regime of totalitarians who violate the RICO Act as a matter of policy. If this entire rigged system of biased media, Facebook censorship, Google search result manipulations and twisted science ends up putting America’s most terrifying political criminal into the White House, it’s lights out for the American we once knew. Almost immediately, the nation fractures into near Civil War, with calls for secession growing unstoppable as state after state seeks to escape the political wrath of an insane regime of D.C. criminals and tyrants. #TEXIT We now live in two Americas: Half the country is tired of everything being rigged, and the other half can’t wait to be exploited by yet another crooked leftist LIAR who rigs everything America is now essentially two nations. On one hand, we have the pro-Trump America, filled with people who are tired of being cheated, censored, punished, stolen from and lied to about everything under the sun. Donald Trump supporters are people who realize everything is rigged… and they’re demanding an end to the corruption and criminality of the fascist system under which we all suffer today. Hillary Clinton supporters are people who are too busy chasing political rainbows to realize everything is rigged. They still believe the lies and the propaganda (the “hope and change” that never came, but is still promised by empty politicians). They’re living in fairy tale delusional worlds that have been woven into their gullible minds by the skillful social engineers of the radical left. These people still think the government cares about them… or that CNN only reports truthful news. They can’t wait to see another globalist in the White House because they are pathetic, weak-minded empty shells of non-consciousness who are wholly incapable of thinking for themselves. These two camps of Americans can no longer coexist. They have almost nothing in common when it comes to knowledge, wisdom, ethics, morals or philosophy. One camp believes in the rule of law (Trump); the other camp believes that people in power should be above the law (Clinton). One camp believes in states’ rights and individual liberty (Trump) while the other camp believes in the consolidation of totalitarian power in the hands of a centralized, domineering government (Clinton). One camp believes in a level playing field, free market competition and rewarding innovation and hard work (Trump), while the other camp believes in free handouts, government “equality” mandates, and the ludicrous idea that “there should be no winners or losers in society.” (Clinton) In other to try to win this election, the Clinton camp has already rigged EVERYTHING from the very start, including the coronation of Hillary, the scheduling of televised debates to minimize their viewership, the surrender of Bernie Sanders to the DNC machine, the mass organization of illegal voting schemes to make sure illegal aliens vote in November, and so much more. No doubt they’re also working extremely hard to rig the black box voting machines all across the country. If you’re tired of everything being rigged, this November vote against the rigged system by voting for Donald Trump. This is truly your last chance to save America from being overthrown by a totalitarian regime of criminals who will crush every last iota of freedom and liberty in America.

Without a shadow of a doubt, technology is the reason we are the way we are today. Having said that, technology has also invaded our privacy in ways unimaginable. While some governments bodies believe they are keeping a tab on people for their own safety, the masses feel it's a complete breach of an individual's privacy.  cbsistatic.com What's happening? Google is known to have made things easy for everyone, even hackers and spies apparently. If the Free Thought Project is to be believed, Google's voice recording feature, that has been integrated into phones to provide more accurate and hands-free search results, has been secretly recording our voices with our consent. The stats revealed by the website are also nothing short of shocking. Google now processes over 40,000 searches per second worldwide. That is the average. That brings us to over 3.5 billion searches per day and a staggering 1.2 trillion searches per year! Bgr The data from these searches are then stored for each individual which is then used for targeting ads and making search more user-friendly. In the same way, Google  can also predict trends of the future thanks to the magnanimous database they have. Even though it is true that Android devices are more vulnerable than iOS, if you're still using Google for your web searches, the company is listening to you. Think of it like a diary on you, that keeps a record of everything you know, like or hate. Especially the most intimate details.  What Google says When this information got revealed, Google didn't deny the allegations but defended them instead by saying that the information gathered on the user is never used personally against any one of them. Instead, it is only done for the purpose of making the user's experience on the web, better. Which is all great, but what if all this lands in the hands of someone who wants to use all this information against us. Will we be able to do anything to stop that person?  What the experts say Experts say our search history is tied to the location data of the device we used to conduct the search. So apart from knowing what your interests are, Google also knows your specific interests based on your location at any given point in time. In their defence, though, Google also gives you the power to change your privacy settings.  How to stop Google from recording everything Go to - 1. history.google.com 2. Click on the three dots that you see on the top-right and click on the Activity controls. 3. Scroll down to Voice & Audio activity and click on Manage Activity. 4. Here you'll find a whole list of the times Google has recorded your voice. With or without you coming to know. It's quite spooky guys, so be prepared.  5. You can delete each of these voice notes manually by clicking on the three dots on the top right corner of each card.  You can also switch off the function altogether if you don't want the app to keep listening to you again. The power lies with you. Cover image from BGR.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Microsoft > Windows FLASH SALE: SpyShelter Firewall      30% OFF! Microsoft Trashes Google in New Edge vs. Chrome Browser Benchmarks GO Redmond performs new browser tests on Windows 10 Sep 16, 2016 05:53 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft rolled out a series of tests earlier this year to demonstrate that its brand-new Edge browser is more energy-efficient and faster than rivals Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera, and the company is now conducting the same benchmark once again after a recent update that Google made to its own browser. Specifically, the recently-released Google Chrome 53 comes not only with material design but also with significant speed improvements, and the search giant claims that its new browser is much faster than a one-year-old version. And because Google praised the performance of its browser, Microsoft decided to conduct a new series of tests to determine the most battery-efficient app at the moment. “We’re thrilled to see improvements across the board, but the trend may look familiar! Microsoft Edge remains the most efficient browser on Windows 10, offering 24%-43% more efficiency across a sample of typical activities including video playback, multi-tab productivity, shopping, social media, and more,” Microsoft said after this new series of tests performed on the same devices running Windows 10 Anniversary Update. In Microsoft’s browser efficiency test on Windows 10, Edge got a better score than both Google Chrome 53 and Opera 39. Firefox 37 got the worst score here, according to the chart you can see above. Beating Google in its own tests Microsoft also performed a test similar to Google’s and used the same methodology to compare Chrome 53 with Edge in Anniversary Update. And the results pretty much speak for themselves: Edge lasted for more than 13 hours, according to Microsoft, and managed to beat Chrome by approximately one hour. Furthermore, it offered five hours more than Firefox. “Regardless of which test you choose, the conclusion is the same: Microsoft Edge lets you browse and watch longer, so you can get more out of your devices without worrying about finding an outlet,” Microsoft explains. Edge also achieved the best performance in real-world power consumption tests, scoring better than Firefox and Chrome. “These numbers are from actual Windows 10 (version 1607) devices used in the real world, not artificial tests or hypotheses. People using Microsoft Edge continue to get more out of their battery every day,” Microsoft says. Of course, Microsoft used this occasion to praise Edge and highlight the features that are part of the Anniversary Update, suggesting that more improvements would come in the next releases too, including the Redstone 2 update due in spring 2017.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Indonesia to probe Google over alleged unpaid tax bill Google has denied the allegations, declaring it had paid all taxes in Indonesia since opening its Jakarta offices in 2011. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Indonesia said it would launch investigations into Google after the technology giant allegedly refused to cooperate with the country's tax department, an official said. Google has denied the allegations, declaring it had paid all taxes in Indonesia since opening its Jakarta offices in 2011. The government has repeatedly asserted the California-based company had outstanding tax issues to resolve. Muhammad Haniv, a senior official with Jakarta's tax office, said Google had refused a request to allow tax officials to examine its financial statements. "We are now elevating this to an investigation, because they refused to be examined. This could be classified as a criminal offence," Haniv told AFP, adding Google generates tens of millions in advertising revenue but contributed little in tax. In a statement Jason Tedjasukmana, the head of corporate communications for Google Indonesia, said the company had always worked closely with the government and had "complied by paying all taxes which apply in Indonesia". Jakarta has also applied pressure to other foreign tech behemoths such as Facebook and Yahoo over their tax arrangements inside Indonesia. Global tech businesses have flooded Indonesia in recent years to capitalise on the exploding number of internet users in the Southeast Asian nation, which has an enormous youth population adept at using smartphones. A third of Indonesia's 255 million have access to the internet but analysts say that number is likely to increase as connectivity improves across the sprawling archipelago.

Muhammad Hanif, head of the specials cases branch in the tax office, said Google’s refusal to cooperate after it was sent a letter in April requesting to be allowed to examine the company’s tax reports had raised suspicions. He told a news conference that the probe would not be launched until the end of the month at the earliest.  PT Google Indonesia, incorporated in 2011, said it was complying with the government. “We continue to cooperate fully with local authorities and pay all applicable taxes,” a Google Indonesia spokesman said in an emailed response to questions. The government had also asked to examine the tax reports of the Indonesian offices of three other U.S. Internet-based companies – Yahoo, Twitter and Facebook. Those three companies have complied, officials said. Yahoo and Google have formed Indonesian limited liability companies, while Twitter and Facebook operate branches of their Asia-Pacific offices in Indonesia. The government believes these companies owe income and value added tax on billions of dollars of revenue they generate from advertising in Indonesia, the tax office said. Hanif said Google’s Indonesian entity was only allocated around 4 percent of the total revenues generated from the country, and it was this amount that was taxed, which he described as too small and “unfair”. The communications ministry had estimated the value of digital advertising in Indonesia at about $800 million last year. The ministry said all of it was untaxed. There was no immediate explanation for the wide discrepancy of the two agencies’ estimates for digital advertising revenue. Indonesia is facing a sizeable revenue shortfall this year as the resource-rich country can no longer rely on commodity-related income. In a separate development, the tax office said it is checking whether Ford Motor Co had avoided paying appropriate taxes, after a local newspaper reported that the U.S. car maker modified imported Everest model vehicles sold in Indonesia to pay a lower tax rate. If the car maker is proven to have caused state losses, it may have to pay back taxes of up to four times the amount it owed, according to Indonesian law. “We have always strictly complied with all Indonesia government regulations and policy, including all import-related tax and customs requirements, related to each of our Ford vehicles officially marketed and sold in the country,” a Ford spokesman said. Ford announced in January it is closing all operations in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, where it held less than a 1 percent market share.

Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Google is Why You Won’t Get Android 7.0 Nougat on Your Old Flagship Phones 451Shares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Haamiz Ahmed 2 months ago Now that Android 7.0 Nougat has been officially made available, smartphone manufacturers are announcing the models that will get the latest version of Android. Most OEMs have already announced which phones will be getting Android Nougat. HTC has said that HTC 10, HTC One M9 and the A9 will be getting the update. Sony has announced that Xperia Z3+, the Z5 range and the Xperia X and XA series will get the Android N update. Similarly, Samsung’s Galaxy flagships and LG G4 and G5 will be getting the upgrade. While on other hand, Google has released Nougat for Nexus 5X, Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P. General Mobile 4G has also been upgraded. Read More: An In-Depth Analysis of Android 7.0 Nougat Features and Issues Popular Phones Left Out Some OEMs, known for upgrading older flagships like HTC, Sony and LG, recently said that their 2014 crop of flagships won’t be getting the upgrade. Popular phones such as the HTC One M8, Xperia Z3 and Z2, LG G2 and G3, and the Nexus 5 were not mentioned by their respective OEMs in the final list of phones getting the upgrade. All of them have either Snapdragon 800/801 and they’re at least 2 years old. Why were they left out? Is there some limitation is the hardware or is there someone else at fault? Lets find out. The OEM Dilemma As an example, developer preview for Android N was available on the Xperia Z3 up until Developer Preview 4. Right before the final upgrade Sony pulled out so why the sudden change? Google is The Culprit Behind Older Phones Not Getting Upgrades to Android 7.0 If the OS runs fine on the phone there seems to be no technical/performance limitation in the Snapdragon 801 (SD 801) at least. Why was the next developer preview or the full version not released? There are also phones like the General Mobile 4G with a mere Snapdragon 410 processor and an Adreno 306 GPU running Android N just fine. Ola Olsson from Sony Mobile Communications said: Yeah, this is sad but we don’t want to play the blame game which means that we can’t say more about the technical limitations. Even if we really wanted to give you N on the Z3(c), we wouldn’t [have] been able to do it. Not if we wanted to pass the Google’s Compatibility Test Suite (CTS). Google’s Stubborn Decision The statement from Sony clearly confirms it that they are facing issues from some other corporation or partner that they can’t directly blame. The real culprit here is Google. Its reasoning is that it wants to eliminate software encryption. Perhaps that might as well be the case, or it just wanted to refocus all its strengths on newer phones. Google has come up with a CTS criteria which limits the OEMs to either upgrade and uncertify the device or forget about the update and follow Google’s footsteps. Google’s End So what is Google CTS? Google CTS stands for the Compatibility Test Suite. Each smartphone manufacturer that wants to use a version of Android on its phones need to get approval from Google to use it. They need to pass the CTS to be able to officially sell a phone running any version of Android. Google releases the Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) which lists the requirements that a phone must fulfill on the hardware and software side to get to use that particular version of Android. For now a CDD hasn’t been released so we can’t say for sure what these phones with SD 801 lack. So if there are no problems on the software side (as the developer preview worked fine) and the hardware side (even low end phones can run it Android N) then what is the issue? Probable Cause If phones with 32-bit processors like the Nexus 6 (Snapdragon 805) are getting Android N, we can also rule out the possibility of a 32-bit/64-bit conflict. What did Qualcomm change from 801 going to the 805? The difference lies in the addition of an extra instruction set for performing hardware encryption. Only 805 comes with it, while the older generation of Qualcomm processors lack this. AES Encryption Earlier when Android Marshmallow was released it required devices to be able to encrypt the file system while having a “Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) crypto performance above 50MiB/sec.”. There were however some exceptions which allowed older devices to be able to run Android 6.0 officially, certified via CTS. Android N added a new file based encryption system allowing for encryption of individual files rather than the whole system. Currently, a CDD isn’t available for Android Nougat but there will be a guaranteed crypto performance limit specified in it when it does come out. The new addition to the Snapdragon 805 was “full disk encryption and cryptographic functions for Android applications”. Qualcomm implemented special hardware to perform cryptographic functions in the 805 due to the newer ARMv8 architecture which specified its use. This seems to be the reason why Nexus 5, Sony Xperia Z3, HTC One M8 will not be getting the new OS while Nexus 6 and others are getting it. These SD 800/801 devices don’t have hardware encryption support but when it comes to software encryption, these devices are more than capable of matching or outperforming the likes of SD 410 even without hardware encryption. The reason being the additional performance benefit that these flagship 800/801 devices carry. Conclusion For those that skipped the details and went straight to the conclusion, there is one simple explanation for this issue. There is no performance/software/technical issue with phones which aren’t getting the update. Google simply opted to favor phones with hardware-based encryption feature leaving the phones that featured only software-based encryption. In real-time use, most users would never even know the difference since the first encryption happens during system file installation. Xperia Z3 has proven that Android 7.0 runs great on SD 801 and that too without hardware-based encryption. Google requires high speed file encryption which the Snapdragon 800/801 (and essentially any processor based on ARMv7) don’t have. They will thus not be able to pass the CTS and will not get official update for Android 7.0 Nougat. So, there’s only one route that you can go (if you have the technical expertise) to get the upgrade, root and get the latest custom ROM available for your device. 451Shares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Taha Najam Plain BS.

It’s nothing that great however, and I’m actually thinking of downgrading back to Marshmallow, or even Lollipop, which I think was the best Android version ever. There are hardly any features in nougat you can’t live without and the only reason I see you’d want to stick to the latest version of android is for the security updates. Muhammad Yasir is your g3 rooted ? Taha Najam Yep. Modded, rooted, running custom kernel, all the works. Murtaza Saeed The article isn’t completely BS, just missing a lot of vital information. Just cause some developer cooked up an N based ROM doesn’t mean LG will hire him and push out the update for that phone. The drivers weren’t released, so they weren’t released. Let’s stop moaning about it. Taha Najam That’s the point. Me running Android 7.0 (and no it’s not N based) proves that the driver point is complete BS. And ROM building is not exactly rocket science, so why would LG need to hire anyone? Also, calm your t|ts, no one’s moaning. Just stating facts. Murtaza Saeed Running 7.0 that isn’t N based? A facepalm wouldn’t do justice to your comment. Taha Najam Are you actually that dense or being on purpose? Well, let me spell it out so even you can understand. Hopefully. Android N = pre release version. Android 7.0 aka Nougat = final signed version from Google. Really hope that got through. Murtaza Saeed Did you think you were being funny or witty with your sarcasm filled comment? You must think you’re really smart for knowing the difference between developer builds and public releases. When I said Android N, I was referring to none other than what you call Android Nougat. Android N, Android 7.0, Android Nougat, they’re all the same thing. If you thought by ‘N based’ that I meant the developer had compiled his ROM using the sources from a Developer Preview, well then you must be a really special kind of stupid. Besides, who on earth would be dumb enough to compile a custom ROM for a Non Nexus device to run on an OS that hasn’t been released to the public yet? Just take that in for a second. Go back to playing clash of clans. You don’t know what you’re talking about. Taha Najam No, I’m honestly curious. And every follow up from you is only leading me to believe I’ve hit the nail on the head: you really are that thick. No I don’t think I’m smart. In fact, there’s a lot I don’t know. But if there’s one thing I’m damn sure of, is that I know a lot more than you. Which isn’t saying a lot, but oh well. Case in point: “Android Nougat. Android N, Android 7.0, Android Nougat, they’re all the same thing.” F. A. C. E. P. A. L. M. “compile a custom ROM for a Non Nexus device to run on an OS ” Uh… oo-kay. TIL Roms run on an OS. I would’ve asked if you’ve ever heard of this thing called AOSP or nightly builds, but I feel like that would be akin to banging my head on a wall. And this, kids, is what happens if you flap your bird all day and night. Literally vegetable. For your own sake, just… stop. Don’t embarrass yourself any further. I’m starting to feel bad now, like I’m bullying the neighborhood “special” kid. Sorry if that hits a little close to home. Murtaza Saeed You know, I thought you’d reply back with something other than 2nd grade insults, but what did I expect. Go ask Naruto to explain how Android works and then come back and spread your never-ending knowledge here. Taha Najam 2nd grade insults… Proceeds to bring up Naruto and Clash of Clan Keep it up, Chuck. Najam Any one knows how can I get code from Vodafone inorder to unlock my bootloader since it is locked. Shehan Actually the real reason for this is because the older chipsets doesn’t support the new Vulcan API and Qualcomm has stated that they won’t be releasing new drivers or support those devices You can read the in depth in the article below http://m.pocketnow.com/2016/08/26/qualcomm-snapdragon-800-801-no-android-nougat-support Not-writing-my-name Oh God. Okay. A few things: – hardware encryption may be the reason. I don’t know. I’m reading it here for the first time. But the Nexus 5 and other older phones, at best, could do software encryption, and that used to bog it down performance-wise. That’s why they were never encrypted. Google’s stance on the Nexus 5x/6p was that software encryption was possible because of drivers made available by Qualcomm. – Nougat requires updated GPU drivers. Google needs OEMs to pass the CTS by updating their GPU drivers, since it also makes use of the Vulkan API. Those OEMs who can update their drivers have announced Android 7. The drivers are made by Qualcomm (since most phones come with Snapdragon chipsets), and Qualcomm refuses to support older chips (e.g. the SD 800/801) as they’re not issuing drivers for those phones. Yes, our phones have drivers for them, which are a part of the software update. Combine these two things, the amount of phones that could currently support Android 7 (officially) would be restricted. And these are the reasons. You could always fire up a custom ROM made by a developer/developers and run that, but the thing with custom ROMs is that they’re not perfect, since things are reverse-engineered. But OEMs won’t follow the same strategy because they’re OEMs. In short, you can’t point fingers at Google alone – Qualcomm has an equal hand in this. Haamiz Ahmed The graphics drivers issue is in my opinion not actually an issue. Z3 went up to Developer preview 4 on Nougat so it doesnt make sense that it suddenly does not work with Vulkan API. The release version is not very different from the Developer preview 4 so i dont think its the graphics drivers. abc They also stopped developing the preview – which meant there must’ve been some dead end they hit. I don’t own it, nor am I a developer – but this would make sense that they didn’t have the drivers. There was a major difference in the last two developers (from what I read). I largely skipped the developer previews because of the battery drain issues and other glitches that didn’t make it a daily driver for me. Haamiz Ahmed Developer preview 5 did not have major differences compared with developer preview 4 aside from general bug fixes and polishing. No “new” features such as vulkan support were added so the point that graphics drivers are at fault is baseless. Here’s my source: http://www.droid-life.com/2016/07/18/android-n-developer-preview-5-now-available/ Zachary Kew-Denniss So badly written. The real reason is that those chipsets aren’t getting updated drivers. Haamiz Ahmed Sony Xperia Z3 was getting developer previews for Android N despite having Snapdragon 801 chipset. As mentioned in the article, Xperia Z3 received updates upto developer preview 4 (second last) which did not have any major differences from developer preview 5 after which the full version of Android N was released. Xperia Z3 worked fine uptil developer preview 4, if the drivers were at fault it wouldn’t have worked with the developer preview either. Zachary Kew-Denniss That doesn’t prove a single damn thing man. My Nexus 4 is on a Nougat Rom! Sony made the developer preview work with the old drivers. A lot of work would have gone into that, but it would never be 100% without the drivers being updated to support the operating system. Qualcomm decided not to update those drivers. OEMs aren’t going to update devices on old drivers when there’s even the slightest chance it could ruin people’s phones. Also, and I can’t stress this enough, that’s the android life span mate. Two updates and you’re out. Zachary Kew-Denniss Also http://m.pocketnow.com/2016/08/26/qualcomm-snapdragon-800-801-no-android-nougat-support Murtaza Saeed The Z3 didn’t get DP5 because Google finalized the Vulkan API in DP5 and Qualcomm had to provide drivers for the SD800/801 chipsets, which they didn’t. Hence the Z3 was unable to go ahead with DP5 and get an official release of N. Did any of you talking about the Z3 actually use the N builds on it? They sucked ass. They were buggy as f*ck and the battery life was terrible. Wasn’t half as stable as the Developer builds for Nexus devices. Murtaza Saeed I don’t understand why everyone is being so butthurt about this. Most devices using Snapdragon 800/801 were released in 2014 (with the exception of the OnePlus X and ZUK Z1), the Galaxy S5, One M8, Xperia Z2/Z3, OnePlus One and others were released 2 years ago. Please tell me, when has any non-Nexus device received MAJOR official software updates for more than 2 years? S5 went from KK > LP > MM, so did the M8, Z2, Z3 and OPO. Why is it such a big surprise this time? HTC, Samsung and OnePlus had announced way before all this Vulkan API bullshit that the One M8, OPO and GS5 would NOT get N. Even if you take an older device as an example, the GS4 started from JB > KK > LP. Never got Marshmallow officially. The Note 4 regardless of having an SD805/Exynos5433 will probably not get N since it started with KK, got LP and will stop at Marshmallow. Yes we all know the Snapdragon 801 is a very capable chipset, you can’t force a company to release drivers for a 2 year old chipset so you can all keep using your ancient phones. If everyone did this, no one would buy new phones and Qualcomm would lose loads of money on R&D for their new chipsets if you all are still using phones from 2 years ago and no one buys new ones.

The reclusive bovine was snapped by in Cambridgeshire in August 2015 but was thrown into the spotlight this week when it was captured by journalist David Shariatmadari. The image has since been retweeted over 9,000 times and received over 12,000 likes. Bovine blur Cars mounted with cameras have scoured the planet mapping landscapes and streets since Google Street View’s launch in 2007. Google automatically blurs human faces and license plates to combat privacy concerns. It’s unclear why the software caught the cow. The animal is clearly visible only moments before, but the close-up receives the secrecy treatment, leading people to question whether the software recognized it as human. A Google spokesperson admitted that clearly the automatic face-blurring technology had clearly “been a little over-zealous.” “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos,” a Google spokesperson told CNN. “Of course, we don’t begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame.” Google wasn’t the only ones seeing the funny side. “Some people think one cow looks much like any udder. Not so!” Said one comment. “Udderly ridiculous,” said another. But it was probably one commentator that summed up the situation best: “Can Google filter out bad jokes as well?” Philippines Foreign Minister: We can't be US' 'little brown brother' forever Japan to join US in South China Sea patrols Related Posts U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power’s motorcade hits, kills boy in Cameroon Calais Jungle: France to shut migrant camp ‘by nightfall’ 5 among group of Czech skiers killed in Austrian avalanche Pope Francis to start first day in Uganda with Mass for martyrs Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

 Alphabet is looking to partner with insurers in France BI Intelligence Sep. 15, 2016, 10:30 PM 1,428 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Hong Kong will start testing smart city projects next year Amazon wants Echos throughout your home Zipline has raised $25 million for humanitarian drone deliveries This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Alphabet is seeking partnerships with insurance companies in France, according to Fortune. Most notably, Alphabet is promoting Nest to insurers, including AXA and Allianz, to develop offerings that “blend technology and hardware with insurance,” according to Nick Leeder, the Managing Director of Google France, speaking in context of Alphabet as a whole. A Nest spokesperson confirmed that Google has worked with AXA in Belgium in the past. Leeder noted that Google is not planning on moving into the insurance market directly. Partnering with insurance companies to provide Nest products helps diversify the company’s sales channels. Nest, which recently had its developers transferred into a new group under the umbrella of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc., has struggled this year, which could be prompting Google to seek out alternative means of selling the devices — in this case indirectly through insurers. In August, Nest partnered with Southern California Edison to offer Nest users discounts on their power bills. This created the incentive for existing Southern California Edison customers to buy a Nest. At the same time, the power company benefit because it can provide less power to Nest-equipped homes, which helps alleviate the power shortages that have hit Southern California recently. Similar to power companies, smart home products can also help insurance companies.Consumer IoT products help insurers more accurately price their premiums by making more informed risk determinations, create better models for payouts, and enlarge their customer base by offering differentiated products. Further, connected home products add a monitoring aspect that could help prevent events that need insurance payouts. For example, if a connected Nest smoke detector detected a fire while the owner was out of the house, it could alert the homeowner through the mobile app, who could then alert the fire department, which would minimize the damage. Insurance companies are increasingly offering smart home products into the insurance packages they provide. Seventeen percent of insurers have already launched or are about to launch products and services that use smart home technology, according to a 2015 Accenture survey. That’s up from 5% in 2015. But at its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption. There are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home. John Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Smart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem. Currently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the "chasm" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices. High prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential. The largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems. "Closed ecosystems" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point. In full, the report: Analyzes the demand of US consumers, based off of survey results Forecasts out smart home device growth until 2020 Determines the current leaders in the market Explains how the connected home ecosystem works Examines how Apple and Google will play a major role in the development of the smart home Some of the companies mentioned in this report include Apple, Google, Nest, August, ADT, Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Lowe's, and Honeywell.

An ethical hacker, Joseph had undertaken the task as part of Google’s bounty programme, which asks anyone to detect and report any lapses in its various services. On September 12, he showed how hackers could get into Google Cloud user’s projects, causing huge losses to companies, big or small. He reported the same to Google, which confirmed the vulnerability the very next day and announced the reward to him. “Google gives bounties, ranging from $100 to $20,000, to ethical hackers after considering the seriousness of the threat they report,” said Joseph, who is Commander of Cyberdome, the cyber crime division of Kerala Police. This is not the first time that the final-year B Tech student of Amal Jyothi Engineering College, Kanjirappally, has been felicitated by multinational tech companies for exposing vulnerabilities in their systems. In the last four years, he earned a whopping Rs 10 lakhs doing so.His list of achievements include showing American Telecommunication giant AT&T that account of their users could be hacked. The feat brought him $5,000. He was also in news for reporting the hacking of Pebble Smartwatch users via a Facebook account. “In that case, I proved that I could hack into the watch through an FB account and destroy it,” he said. Pebble is one of the leading smartwatch makers in the world. His work has earned him acknowledgement from Google, Twitter, Yahoo, AT&T and also Microsoft, for which he reported vulnerabilities on four occasions. For him, security analysis is a hobby, which he is using as a pocket-money maker.

 Google boosts its video and app ad products BI Intelligence Sep. 15, 2016, 8:30 PM 1,000 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Snapchat has partnered with Foursquare to improve geofilters Google won't build ad blocking into Chrome Google has shut down a malicious ad attack on its AdSense network This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Digital Media Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google announced a couple new features for its ad products at the DMEXCO digital media conference. These include an upgrade to its Universal App Campaigns to let all advertisers target app-install ads based on users' in-app activity, and the new ability to add call-to-action (CTA) buttons in YouTube TrueView ads. The latter update will boost Google’s yield from TrueView ads, while the former will expand Google’s client base in the app-install space: Integrating CTAs into YouTube TrueView ads. TrueView are a premium YouTube ad format that advertisers pay for only when the ad is viewed through to the end, or leads to a download or purchase. Advertisers will now be able to include interactive call-to-action buttons like "Sign Up," "Get a quote," or "Book now" inside these ads. Google  that YouTube helps 47% of U.S. adults aged 18 to 54 (around 70 million people) make a purchasing decision on a monthly basis.  Opening Universal App Campaigns to everyone. This product promotes developers apps across search, display, Gmail, Youtube, and Google Play. Earlier this year, Google launched an ad targeting option based on the likelihood that a user would complete a given action. This behavioral targeting option is now available to advertisers too, who will need to link their AdWords account to a third-party measurement partner, Firebase Analytics or Google Analytics, to track users’ activity and send the data back to Google, so that it can apply its machine learning algorithms to user intent signals. Google also said that it had generated over three billion app installs from ads – up from the two billion installs announced at I/O in May, when Facebook announced that it had driven two billion app installs. The numbers show how quickly Google has caught up to Facebook – which was a long head start in the app install ad market – reflecting the success and effectiveness of Universal App Campaigns, as noted by Marketing Land.   To receive stories like this one directly to your inbox every morning, sign up for the Digital Media Briefing newsletter. Click here to learn more about how you can gain risk-free access today.

Australia's Google Tax, formally known as the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL), is modelled on the UK's and imposes penalties on companies that move money offshore for the sole purpose of legally-but-cynically avoiding tax. The ATO yesterday issued two "Taxpayer Alerts," documents it releases to record "concerns about new or emerging higher-risk tax arrangements or issues that we have under risk assessment." Taxpayer Alert 2016/11 says the ATO is working with multinationals that need to alter their affairs, but remains "concerned ... that some taxpayers are entering into artificial and contrived arrangements in attempts to avoid the application of the MAAL." Indeed the Office says it's just found a new one it considers "artificial and contrived," as it "involves interposing an entity described as a partnership between the foreign entity originally making supplies to Australian customers, and the Australian customers." "The partnership has one resident corporate partner with a minority interest in the partnership, therefore purporting to characterise the partnership as an 'Australian entity' for the purposes of the MAAL." But nothing changes in the business' actual operations, and the ATO says: "The arrangements have little, if any, commercial basis." Alert 2016/10 signals a probe into "robin-type arrangements that involve funding of an overseas entity or operations by an Australian entity, where the funds are subsequently provided back to the Australian entity or its Australian associate in a manner which purportedly generates Australian tax deductions while not generating corresponding Australian assessable income." The Australian Financial Review reports that senior ATO officials learned of one of the schemes described above in a chat with a major accountancy practice that is restructuring the affairs of known MAAL-feasants. Big accounting firms are often global or have tentacles in many nations: The Register suspects the schemes the ATO worries about will be known to accountants in other lands. There's no hint in the Financial Review or the ATO's alerts that big tech companies are the source of these new tax dodge attempts. But we know the likes of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, eBay and Google have form. It would not be surprising if their names appear in future despatches. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 29 Comments More from The Register Spain's Prime Minister wants to ban internet memes.

According to data from Google, Cubs fans are searching for information on the team in droves. Searches for manager Joe Maddon skyrocketed by 1100 percent in the United States this week, according to the popular search engine, as people sought information on the Cubs’ famous skipper. Along with searching for information about Maddon’s argument with umpire Joe West earlier this week in St. Louis, fans are asking Google some interesting questions about the manager. Here are the top five searches, according to Google: 1. Why was Joe Maddon ejected? Maddon was ejected from Monday’s game against the Cardinals after Kyle Hendricks gave up a home run in the ninth inning. Seeking to give Aroldis Chapman time to warm up, Maddon sent the infield and catcher Miguel Montero to the mound, but umpire Joe West ordered Montero back to the plate and tried to break up the conference. Maddon disagreed with the decision, and was summarily ejected from the contest. 2. How old is Joe Maddon? Maddon is 62 years old, and grew up in Hazelton, Pennsylvania. 3. What team did Joe Maddon play for? Maddon is one of the few managers in Major League Baseball that never played in the big leagues, with his career in the minor leagues ending in the late 1970’s. He was a member of the California Angels organization during that time and later became a roving instructor and scout for the team when his playing career ended. 4. How tall is Joe Maddon? Maddon is 5-foot-11. 5. Is Joe Maddon married? Unfortunately for Cubs fans who are attracted to older men with white hair and thick glasses, Maddon is indeed married to his wife Jaye, whom he tied the knot with after the 2008 baseball season. Players for the Cubs are also being scouted by fans looking for a deeper understanding behind the team’s success. National League MVP favorite Kris Bryant is the most searched for Cubs player according to Google’s search information, with Cy Young Award candidate Kyle Hendricks ranking just behind him. Anthony Rizzo, Jake Arrieta, and Jason Heyward all round out the top five of players that fans are searching for on the popular website.

Nearly half of web users expect a site to load within two seconds – and they’ll abandon a site that isn’t loaded within three seconds (source, see also this detailed study). This sounds like brutal behaviour, but it’s the reality; users aren’t sat whilst your site loads with a stopwatch, ready to stop and do something else, but if your site isn’t loading promptly, they are ready to tab over to another site or head back to Google and load up a competitor. Straightforward message from the authors of this extensive report into the effect of site performance and user experience. Site speed is also an important part of search engine rankings. Google wants to display the best results, but it also wants to display results that are easy to access – and part of that is loading fast. Google has been considering site speed in its ranking algorithms since 2010. How do you actually make your site faster? We’ve established it’s imperative that your site loads quickly. So what now? There are two simple stages: Analyse Improve We’ll run through each of these in turn. Get your site open and follow along – these are methods you can start using right away on your site. Step 1: analyse your site How fast is your site right now? Let’s find out. We’ll use three free tools to see what our starting point is: Pingdom Tools: use this to test how long in seconds your site takes to load. Set the “test from” location to something closest to where most of your visitors come from. Remember what you select so we can consistently check results later. Google PageSpeed: use this to see what Google thinks of your loading time. You’ll get a score out of 100 and suggestions of how to improve. Anything over 80 is good here but you want this as high as possible. We’ll cover fixing the main issues later, but you can also “show how to fix” for detailed instructions from Google. P3 Plugin Profiler: you may have heard that having lots of plugins is bad for your site’s loading time. This isn’t true. Having bloated plugins is bad for your site’s loading time. Install this free plugin and run the profiler (you’ll find it under Tools on your WordPress Dashboard, using “Auto Scan” is fine). You’ll then be able to find out what impact which plugins are having on your site’s loading time. We’ve got a real-world loading speed of under one second and are faster than 90% of websites – pretty good going. Take a screenshot of all of your site’s scores on the three different profilers. We’ll come back to these later to see what improvement has been made. What about themes? A fast theme is essential. Obviously you’re reading an article about making really fast WordPress sites on WPZOOM.com and we make WordPress themes – so you can guess our themes are very fast. Our popular Foodica theme is well-optimized for site speed. It’d obviously be unfair to claim we are the only people making fast WordPress themes; there are other theme providers who also do a very good job of making their themes fast. However, not all WordPress themes are created equal. There are a lot of slow themes available which will have a seriously detrimental impact on your site. What to look out for is especially bloated “do-it-all” themes which, in attempting to cater for all possible use-cases, produce huge files and load a lot of features that are totally unnecessary. If you’re looking for a theme you know will give you a solid foundation for a very fast website (as we’ll explain here, your theme is a starting point but there are other factors) then check out our themes. What about hosting? In this tutorial we’ll equip you with the tools you need to make your site load as fast as possible. Note as fast as possible may still not be outright fast. A key factor here is hosting. If you’re using a slow host or entry-level shared hosting (where your site is hosted in the same place as lots of other sites) you’re unlikely to find the very top speeds available. If you’re on a budget this is okay, but if your site is part of your business, represents your business or represents you professionally it’s likely worth investing in something that’s really good. The worst hosting is likely to be very detrimental for your site, but okay hosting (and obviously anything better than that) will be a reasonable starting point. We have three hosts we recommend: find more details here. Step 2: improve loading time Improving your site’s speed is just a case of knowing what tools to use – and then using them. There are a number of different factors that need attention when making a site fast. We’ll look at each of these now. A really good caching plugin Caching is the thing that will make the biggest difference to your site’s loading time. Just installing a caching plugin on your site can halve the loading time of your site. There are many caching plugins available, but two free ones dominate the competition: WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache. These plugins have been available for years and both do a very solid job of caching your site. Super Cache has fewer features but is easier to set up whilst Total Cache has more features but requires more setup – and not all the features work on entry-level hosts. Your site needs to load fast for visitors’ convenience in any time or any place. Pictured: Foodica theme on the go. Comparing feature lists is only so helpful: the best way to compare caching plugins is to see which is fastest in the real world. Given the plugins are free you can test on your site (as all hosting environments differ a bit), but tests generally show: W3 Total Cache is faster. Lots more features but may overcomplicate caching for users who just want to get on with it. Best if you want more control. WP Super Cache is slightly slower but better suited for entry-level hosting. Also easier to set up. Best if you want to install and forget. A third option exists for caching. WP Rocket is a premium caching plugin with pricing starting at $39. It’s the fastest caching plugin available. Various independent tests show the plugin to be significantly faster than the most popular free offerings (and all other paid plugins). WP Rocket is packed with features – but also makes itself easy to set up. You get the best of both worlds. As with hosting, if the speed of your site is important to your bottom-line, it makes sense to get the very best tools available, and that would be WP Rocket. Otherwise, Super Cache or Total Cache will do a very good job – and all three are much better than doing nothing at all. Optimize images and load them quickly Images have the potential to be a problem-spot on WordPress powered sites: you can make your site lightning fast with great caching, but users can upload huge images to posts and pages which slow loading times to a crawl. To avoid images causing any problems you want to do two things: Optimize images to reduce their file size. Ensure they can be loaded really quickly. Doing these two things used to a hassle, but a single plugin can now sort everything for you automagically – and it’s free. Jetpack by WordPress.com (made by Automattic, the quasi-parent-company of WordPress) features a module called Photon, which is your one-stop location for images. Jetpack is the best solution for hosting your images. Install Jetpack by going to Plugins → Add New on your WordPress Dashboard, then searching for “Jetpack by WordPress.com”. Install and activate the plugin. You’ll be prompted to connect to WordPress.com, which you can do next. Either create a new account or sign in and you’ll be connected. Final step is to go to Jetpack → Settings and activate the Photon module. Photon automagically hosts your images from WordPress.com’s content delivery network, a network of servers designed to load content (ie your images) as fast as possible. It also compresses your images on the fly using a combination of image optimization tools and resizes images to be the right size for the space they’re loading (so an image originally 3,000px wide will be loaded at 700px in a 700px wide content area). Photon is an incredibly impressive tool and you can set-it-and-forget-it, safe in the knowledge your images will be loaded as fast as possible. As images are loaded from WordPress.com network you’ll also find the bandwidth used by your site decreases – saving you hosting costs. Despite Photon’s impressive offering, there is still room for improvement here. Jetpack does a good job of optimizing JPG images but not such a good job for PNGs. To get PNG optimization maxed out you’ll want EWWW Image Optimizer. The plugin runs image optimization on your own server (which means it uses more resources – but you don’t have to pay extra for it). Install pngout for maximum image optimization. To maximize the plugin you’ll need to make a couple of extra tweaks: from the plugin’s settings page change the PNG optimization from Lossless to Lossy. Next, go to the Advanced tab and untick the “disable pngout” box. Save changes and you’ll see an error pop up. This is just telling you pngout needs to be installed separately – click “automatically” and the plugin will handle everything for you. You’ll then have access to superior PNG optimization. When combined with Jetpack, this will make sure your images load as fast as possible. Bonus: if you’ve recently changed theme and your thumbnails are now the wrong sizes, install and run Regenerate Thumbnails. Once installed you’ll find it under Tools → Regen. Thumbnails. Run the plugin and it’ll fix everything for you. Dealing with bloated plugins Let’s now return to the plugins you tested earlier with P3. Below are some sample results from the plugin. As you can see, the site uses a modest ten plugins but two make up the vast majority of loading time. These are an email lead generation plugin and Jetpack by WordPress.com, which we looked at earlier. A couple of other plugins, including the popular WordPress SEO plugin, have a modest impact. Sample results from the P3 profiler. P3 can create a lot of false positives and it’s important to identify these before going further: The loading impact of Jetpack is overstated as it loads stats for logged-in users with every page load, thus generating extra load time. Regular users, however, won’t see this – to get round this you can use an incognito window and run a manual scan. This will give you Jetpack’s true load impact. Caching plugins such as the ones we looked at earlier often have overstated impact. This is as generating the cache is highly resource intensive – but again regular users won’t see this. You can generally safely ignore the results from your caching plugin, safe in the knowledge it is making your site load faster. Having lots of plugins, then, isn’t necessarily bad: plugins with a big impact on your loading time (that aren’t false positives) are the ones to look out for. You may decide that a particularly resource intensive plugin is a sacrifice you want to make so you can add functionality to your site. You may also, however, be able to replace especially intensive plugins with simpler alternatives. A fully fledged gallery plugin could be replaced by a slider, for example. Plugins with a big impact on load time that you want to keep may have some performance options. Plugins such as the email lead plugin in the example above often have options to only load on pages where they’re activated – but this typically isn’t on by default and it’s up to you to make the changes that get the loading gains. What about what Google thinks? The final thing to consider is the PageSpeed score from Google we collected at the start of this post. The score is a theoretical rather than reflection of your actual loading time, although generally higher scores are found on faster sites. Also bear in mind getting to 100 is not possible for all sites on all hosts. As we mentioned, anything over 80 is good. As with all other parts of the site, making Google happy is just a matter of working through a number of tools. You’ll want to install and setup all of these to make Google happiest: Autoptimize will minimize (make smaller) your site’s HTML, CSS and JS. Install and check options in the plugin’s settings to optimize all three of HTML, CSS and JS and you’re done. Remove Query Strings From Static Resources does literally what it says on the tin. There are no options – install the plugin and Google will be happier. If you’re using Disqus to power your comments, swap the plugin for Disqus Conditional Load. They’re the same plugins, but the latter only loads when needed. This delivers a real-world speed improvement and improves your PageSpeed score. These three tools combined with everything else we’ve looked at here will make a strong improvement to your site’s loading time. Once you’re done, re-test with Google and you should see a strong improvement. A faster site with happier customers Improving loading time isn’t difficult, but it’s important. You need to follow the steps we’ve looked at here and embark on your own testing, but it’s possible to get a fast site for nearly everyone on nearly all hosts. Here’s a recap of the tools mentioned in this article: Pingdom Tools for testing loading time. Google PageSpeed for testing what Google thinks of your site. P3 Plugin Profiler for testing plugin load impact. Our recommended web hosts. WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache for free caching. WP Rocket for premium (fastest) caching. Jetpack by WordPress.com for magical image optimization and loading. EWWW Image Optimizer for bonus image optimization. Regenerate Thumbnails to fix broken image previews. Autoptimize for minification. Remove Query Strings From Static Resources is highly self-explanatory. Disqus Conditoinal Load for better loading from Disqus comments. Look through these tools and utilise the ones which are best for you. Once you’re done, you’ll have a fast loading site that will make your visitors – and search engines – happy to keep coming back again and again. Of course, having a beautiful and fast WordPress theme is helpful too ;) Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Related Subscribe to the WPZOOM newsletter.

Follow @AlexDenning 7 Comments Reply karl peschel September 14, 2016 4:07 pm I have seen a number of articles, like this one from a premium caching plugin, warn against removing query strings. http://docs.wp-rocket.me/article/56-remove-query-string-on-static-resources Doing something JUST to chase a better score or make some testing tool “happy” is not advisable. Make sure you know the ramifications of any speed optimization you do, and pay more attention to load time than the scores. Reply Alex Denning September 20, 2016 11:38 am Interesting, thanks for the feedback. Removing query strings will mean your static resources are cached, which is the main aim. May be useful to disable the plugin when making updates, but it’s similar to caching any other part of the site and needing to clear before changes are visible :) Reply karl peschel September 20, 2016 4:18 pm But if that Query string adds a version number, is it REALLY a static resource?? Seems to be the opposite in my opinion. Reply Mark Fayard September 14, 2016 8:57 pm You had me up until I saw BlueHost as a recommended hosting provider. Reply Alex Denning September 20, 2016 11:35 am They’re fine for starting out and very affordable, which is what a lot of people want. We do also recommend WPEngine for sites needing something extra. Reply Lokesh October 13, 2016 11:19 am Dos this also works on a free hosting providers like 000web…?

This cow's face was blurred out on a canal path in Cambridge. Google street view A cow roaming on a canal tow path has proved an internet hit - after someone spotted Google had given the same blur treatment normally given to human's to protect their privacy. The animal was captured by Google's street view cameras at Coe Fen in Cambridge in August last year. But the cow's pixelated face quickly became a social media phenomenon when Guardian journalist David Shariatmadari tweeted a screen grab of it on Tuesday. Moments before the cow's face was in full view. Google street view It has since been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked by more than 12,000 people. One twitter user said the blur applied to the cow's face was "Udderly ridiculous", while another said the cow was now "anonymoos". However just a few metres further along the tow path, the cow's face can been seen without a blur effect added. A Google spokesperson told ITV News: "We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. "Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame." Share this article Share via email Share via Facebook Share via Twitter Share via Whatsapp Home UK WHERE TO NOW?

The picture, which was taken last summer at Coe Fen, was spotted by the Guardian’s US opinion editor David Shariatmadari. David Shariatmadari (@D_Shariatmadari) Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously pic.twitter.com/ACTBpDwno6 September 13, 2016 Although the cow can be seen in all its bovine glory in one image near the river Cam, Google appears to have blurred it for a tighter crop. The search giant admitted its technology may have been a little overeager. A spokesperson for Google told the BBC: “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it’s clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. Of course, we don’t begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame.” Shariatmadari’s tweet has been retweeted more than 9,000 times – with plenty of cow jokes among the replies. Tim Bale (@ProfTimBale) @D_Shariatmadari @jonworth Some people think one cow looks much like any udder. Not so! September 13, 2016 Dave smith (@Powys_power_gat) @D_Shariatmadari was she asked mooove out of the way or was the pic taken on the hoof? September 13, 2016 Rev. Howard Furst (@revhowardfurst) @D_Shariatmadari @jazmasta Cows should dress more modestly so they don't have to have their faces blurred in shame. pic.twitter.com/dBkfvpVprR September 13, 2016 The cow picture has echoes of an image released in May by West Midlands police of three lambs being transported in a Ford Galaxy people carrier. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stolen lambs Photograph: West Midlands Police/PA Officers spotted the unusual cargo in Yardley, Birmingham, and pursued the vehicle, which hit a parked car. Three men abandoned the Ford and its cuddly cargo, but were arrested after a search of nearby gardens. One was found up a tree and another in a conservatory. The three lambs were rehomed at a farm in Sheldon while officers attempted to trace their owners.

Google Duo was one of two messaging apps announced during Google’s developer conference a few months ago. Duo is a video messaging app, while its counterpart Allo is a text messaging app powered by the Google Assistant. The app had reached five million downloads in the first week that it had been released, a number which has doubled in the three weeks following. However, you’d never know of it’s success while its currently ranked number 127 in the App Store. Just two days after its launch, Duo had risen to first place the Google Play Store. Since then, the app has fallen from grace by more than 100 spaces. However, according to Android Police, those who use it really enjoy it, therefore awarding it with 4.4 stars. Reviewers have praised the app’s simplicity, despite getting overshadowed by other announcements during Google’s developer conference. Both Duo and Allo are end to end encrypted. Download Duo on iOS and Android here. Related: Google’s voice chat app Duo has been downloaded over 5 million times on Android SourceAndroid Police Vito R. Allo is *optionally* end to end encrypted but only if in incognito mode. In which case you don’t get the Google Assistant benefits. FlamesFan89 I’ve been using Duo with my parents. They love to have video chats with our kids. The quality of Duo is much higher compared to Hangouts. I’m happy with the switch. Ipse Yeah, but can you make calls to regular phones? I’m a Hangouts user confused by the new apps…. FlamesFan89 No, it is purely for video chats. I too am confused by the need for multiple apps, but I’m starting to think that they are taking the “Steam Whistle” approach, as in, Steam Whistle beer, who’s tag line is “Do one thing really, really well”. Ipse I get it…after a few beers, the differences start to fade away 🙂 I’ll stick with Hangouts for now…really don’t want another app. If Duo worked with FaceTime (and we know why it doesn’t) it might have convinced more users to switch.

The internet's 10 most popular websites were found to have nearly twice as many shades of blue than red and yellow, and three times as much as green. These finding were revealed by a designer who scraped the popular websites and recorded all the colours used in the homepages and style sheets.  Facebook, Wikipedia and Amazon all have something in common - not only these sits some of the most visited on the web, but they are all blue. The internet's 10 most popular websites have nearly twice as many shades of blue than red and yellow, and three times as much as green  THE TOP 10 WEBSITES 1. Google 2. YouTube 3.  Facebook 4.  Baidu 5. Yahoo  6. Wikipedia 7. Amazon 8. Google.co 9. Qq  10. Twitter  Although a small sample size, as there are some 4.7 million pages on the World Wide Web, it is enough for some to name blue the internet's 'most popular colour'. Paul Herbert, the mastermind behind this research, used Alexa to narrow down the 10 most popular sites on the web, which includes Google (#1), Amazon (#7) and YouTube (#3). After gathering a complete list of colours found on all of these webpages, Herbert transformed the data into a series of visuals, reports Wired. 'I often struggle to create colour schemes, and was curious about what other companies are doing,' he told Wired. Other research for the colour blue shows that it makes people feel tranquil, wet and cool. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next From a solar eclipse to a star gazing warrior: Winners of...

Share this article Share 39 shares While red is found to stimulate senses, which is why many restaurants include the colour in their logo, blue does just the opposite – it relaxes the mind. It seems the most popular websites on the internet have used this colour on their homepages and style sheets in an attempt to make people feel calm so they spend more time on the site. Paul Herbert, the mastermind behind this research, used Alexa to narrow down the 10 most popular sites on the web, which includes Google (#1), Amazon (#7) and YouTube (#3) Although, Facebook may be the exception since its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colour blind and blue is the colour he can see the best. Herbert has plans to rescrape the data regularly, but intends to keep the analysis to a minimum, as it can become outdated when the data changes. 'Once I have data over a larger time period I'll be able to examine and graph trends in web development,' he said. WHAT FEELINGS DO RED, GREEN AND BLUE PROVOKE? Red: Passionate, Aggressive, Important As a dominating color, red adds gravity and heightened awareness – quite literally, as the color increases blood circulation, breathing rates, and metabolism. Red can take on a variety of meaning, associated with both love and war, but the unifying factor in all meanings is a sense of importance. Think of the red carpet. Red is a color best used cautiously. Its knack for attracting attention makes it a priceless tool for designers, but excessively it will inhibit relaxation. Lighter shades emphasize the energetic aspects of red – including youthfulness – while darker shades emphasize power, and even durability, such as a brick wall. Green: Natural, Stable, Prosperous Green mostly represents the environment and outdoors, making it the clear choice to suggest nature and an organic quality. As the bridge between stimulating warm colors and calming cool colors, it is the most balanced of colors, lending it an air of stability. It's also a popular choice as an accent or for calls-to-action because it stands out, but more softly than the warmer colors. In Western Culture, it also represents money and financial safety. Blue: Serene, Trustworthy, Inviting Blue is one of the most popular colors in web design – and for good reason. Blue is the color of calm and serenity, and as such inspires security and a feeling of safety. For this reason, blue is a color often used by banks. However the calming effects also make blue a friendly and inviting color, which explains its adoption by Facebook and Twitter.  'I also plan to examine the difference in color usage between popular websites from different parts of the world.' The internet isn't the only place shrouded in blue, many stores have used the colour in their advertisements. A recent study from the University of Oregon and University of Cincinnati looked at how colors influence or biases the way consumers make ethical judgments, specifically if they view a company as environmentally friendly. Herbert recorded all the colours used in the homepages and style sheets. After gathering a complete list of colours found on all 10 sites, Herbert then transformed the data into a series of visuals Results indicated consumers considered companies with blue logos to be more eco-friendly, compared to those with red logos. 'What we're finding is that color biases the way consumers make ethical judgments,' Aparna said Sundar, a professor of marketing in the University of Oregon Lundquist College of Business.  'Of course green is one of those colors, but blue is also one of those colors that consumers associate with eco-friendliness.'  The team gave shoppers a fictitious logo with a color of a known brand in different colours to gauge their reactions. Herbert has plans to rescrape the data regularly, but intends to will keep analysis to a minimum, as it could become outdated when the data changes Once researchers established a set of eco-friendly colors, they also identified colors perceived to be environmentally unfriendly, such as Target's red.  The results indicated that seeing a more eco-friendly color in a logo influences consumer judgments, and ethically ambiguous business practices seemed more ethical.  'Interestingly, blue is 'greener' than green in terms of conveying an impression of eco-friendliness, despite the frequent use of the word green to convey that idea,' said co-author James Kellaris of the University of Cincinnati's marketing department    Read more: The Most Popular Color On The Internet Is… | WIRED The Colors of the Web Share or comment on this article e-mail 39 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Now that Google Arts and Culture has added the famous halls and rooms of the British Prime Minister’s home and working quarters to its ever-growing collection of virtual reality tours and experiences, you can play political heavyweight for a day — or at the very least, see what it’s like to live and work in those quarters. As of Thursday, Google Arts and Culture invites anyone and everyone to “walk through historic rooms and hallways and get up-close looks at more than 50 photographs and works of art” inside historic 10 Downing Street in London. “Take a peek into the cabinet room, where the Prime Minister has held weekly cabinet meetings since 1735, or look around Margaret Thatcher’s office,” Google wrote in a blog post announcement. “Stroll down the grand main staircase, stopping to study the carefully ordered portraits of the house’s previous residents. Once you’re ready for some fresh air, you can wander through the gardens, where Winston Churchill liked to nap.” Related: You’ll be blown away by the world’s first virtual reality ballet experience It’s the latest in a series of exhibits Google has introduced to its unique digital museum of sorts. Already, you can stomp about with dinosaurs or go en pointe with ballerinas from some of the most prestigious companies in the world, and now you can get immersed in British politics. In addition to the tour of the prime minister’s office, Google has two other new online exhibits. The first serves as an introduction to  “two of Britain’s most iconic leaders, Winston Churchill and Harold Wilson.” The other draws attention to three of 10 Downing’s most historic places: the cabinet room, the study, and the grand staircase. While you can use your Android device, iPhone, or desktop to experience the virtual tour, the full immersive experience can be best achieved with Google Cardboard, which comes complete with the built-in audio tour. But hey, even without a VR headset, this is a pretty nifty way to visit one of the most historic sites in the U.K. Also watch: Google Brings Dinosaurs to Life in Arts & Culture App Please enable Javascript to watch this video

No one has harpooned the beast yet, but stunningly Amazon.com Inc. may be coming the closest. Everyone wants to be the digital brain at the centre of our automated homes. Just as Microsoft Corp.’s Windows became the software nervous system of nearly all personal computers, the thinking goes, some company will eventually become the Windows of the home. It will rule everything, from automatically recording a TV show to remotely unlocking the front door for a handyman. The company that figures out the home operating system may, like Microsoft did, bask in riches and shape the direction of the digital world. We’re far from achieving this Jetsons-like vision, but tech companies aren’t giving up. Apple’s new iOS 10 software for iPhones puts the company’s HomeKit home operating system front and centre, and chief executive officer Tim Cook proclaimed it “a huge moment for home automation”. Expect Google (Alphabet Inc.) to soon push hard with Google Home, one of the company’s multiple, chaotic attempts to become the digital controller for our homes. Somehow, surprisingly, Amazon has outmanoeuvred Apple, Google and all the other tech industry big guns with its two-year-old Echo line of digital-activated speakers that had cost $180. As pitched by Alec Baldwin in Super Bowl ads, the Echo will tell you the weather while you get dressed in the morning and play a Janet Jackson song at a voice command. The broader ambition, of course, is to connect users to Amazon shopping and to become a home operating system through connections to lights, door locks, refrigerators and any other imaginable thing that can be implanted with a computer chip. On Wednesday, Amazon announced that it would sell its Echo Dot model for $50—a price low enough to push many more curious people to buy one and plant Amazon’s home software brain in a room or two (or six) in the house. It also made an Echo model available outside the US for the first time. If the smart home ever becomes a reality—and tech history is littered with predictions of digital revolutions that never happened—it’s premature to pick winners and losers. Amazon’s biggest disadvantage is that the smartphone is still the centre of the world’s digital life, and that makes smartphone-based home automation approaches like Apple’s and Google’s the better bet. The Echo has been a hit so far only among a niche of technophiles, and Amazon’s reported goal of selling as many as 10 million of them next year is dinky compared with the 1 billion Apple devices in use worldwide. But when Amazon devotes itself to a mission, it can bulldoze everything it sees. The key to becoming a dominant operating system is persuading as many other companies as possible to tailor their products to your operating system, just as Microsoft did with Windows and Apple with iPhones. That’s what Amazon is doing by slowly convincing makers of air conditioners and thermostats and home security cameras to tailor their products to work with Amazon’s home software brain. The company is also planting its Echo-powering Alexa software into other companies’ home products and onto smartphone apps for iPhone and Android. That will help build the rationale for adapting home products for Amazon. Amazon is also devoting its considerable resources to push more people to buy Echo devices, including by offering a discount on diapers and a cut-price music service exclusively for Echo owners. Quietly, including in recent days, Amazon has been folding Alexa into its Fire TV streaming gadgets, into its Amazon Video apps for movies and TV shows and into its Fire tablets. These are all stealth ways for Amazon to make its home automation-capable software more intelligent and to spread it into more places. Amazon has never been content to be the world’s biggest bookstore. It became a store for everything. It transformed shopping into a membership club. The company invented a new model of computing with Amazon Web Services and planted its flag to become a global television network. And so we should never count Amazon out as the company that might land that white whale of taking over our digital homes.

 Apple is loading up talent for its push into Google Glass territory Kif Leswing Sep. 15, 2016, 6:53 PM 11,958 facebook linkedin twitter email print An artist's conception of Tim Cook wearing Google Glass. (Not a real photo.) AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images Apple continues to stockpile talent in augmented reality, an area that CEO Tim Cook has said is "incredibly interesting", as it looks like the company is working on some kind of display or technology that shows computer images superimposed on top of the real world. This month, Apple hired Zeyu Li, who had worked at Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality startup, for over a year. He's "interested in deep learning, VR, AR, driverless car," according to his LinkedIn profile.  In June, Yury Petrov started as a research scientist at Apple. Previously, he had worked at Oculus, Facebook's virtual reality platform, and taught at Northeastern University. "I am a specialist in experimental psychology, human vision, optics for head-mounted displays, brain imaging, and mathematical methods of signal processing and analysis," according to his LinkedIn summary. (Virtual reality immerses viewers in a 360-degree computer-generated world, while augmented reality simply superimposes images on the real world.) Apple has a team of hundreds of staff building prototypes of potential headset configurations, the Financial Times reported in January.  Apple's hiring spree in this area really kicked off in May 2015, when it bought AR startup Metaio, an augmented reality startup. Metaio's CEO, Thomas Alt, still works at Apple, but he recently changed his focus from engineering to strategic deals. He is now a "director of procurement," according to his LinkedIn profile.      Meanwhile, iOS app developer Steven Troughton-Smith revealed that Apple has included several references to a "HeadMountedDisplayRenderingTechnique" in a key framework.  Apple should ape HoloLens; app platforms are their thing — leave VR to others. This has been in SceneKit since iOS 9 pic.twitter.com/kArfYIIHDI — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 15, 2016   For sure, they should be working on an augmented reality computer before a car. The advances in SceneKit in iOS 10 seem designed for it — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 15, 2016   If Apple is indeed working on an AR device, it'll have a lot of competition. Google kicked off the commercial AR field with Glass, and the company hasn't entirely given up on the concept, although there are continued signs of disarray in the latest version of the project. Plus, Google is a big investor in secretive AR startup MagicLeap, Microsoft has HoloLens, and Snapchat is quietly working on its own AR glasses. Know anything about Apple's AR project?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A Google-powered system of satellites is helping governments crack down on the practice of illegal fishing by spying on boats and fisheries. Google played a key role in the development of Global Fishing Watch, which uses satellites, receivers on land, and the locator systems on ships to keep watch on everything happening in the world's oceans, according to The Washington Post. The program is designed for governments, journalists, and ordinary citizens to keep an eye on fishing areas and whether or not ships are following the law. The program was launched Thursday, but the data that's available dates back four years. It can also be used by insurance companies who want to keep an eye on ships. Marine-advocacy group Oceana and SkyTruth, a nonprofit based in West Virginia, also helped develop the program. "We will be able to see a lot of information about who is fishing where," Jacqueline Savitz, vice president for U.S. oceans at Oceana, told the Post. "We're hoping it will be useful to a lot of different sectors." The platform, GlobalFishingWatch.org, is free and provides updates almost in real time. "Working with Oceana and Google has enabled us to take a good idea and build it into something that will improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the planet," John Amos, president and founder of SkyTruth, said in a press release. "Global Fishing Watch will catalyze the science, policy-making and public pressure necessary to make our oceans sustainable."

News UK Home News Google street view camera blurs cow's face in Cambridge Company blames ‘overzealous’ privacy technology for concealing the cow’s identity Harry Cockburn Thursday 15 September 2016 22:31 BST The cow in question Google Google’s street view cameras have protected the privacy of a cow in Cambridge by blurring its face out. The animal was photographed by the Google street view camera on a towpath at Coe Fen, in Cambridge. However, the software which is programmed to blur out human faces appears to have mistakenly given a passing cow the treatment. A tweet by The Guardian’s David Shariatmadari drew attention to the mysterious cow.

It has been liked more than 12,000 times. But the streetview camera didn’t immediately blur out the face of the cow. From a further distance, the cow’s white face and pink nose can be clearly seen. But as the camera gets closer to the grazing animal, the software apparently recognised it as human and blurred it out.  From further away, the cow's non-human face is clearly visible (Google) A spokesman for Google said: “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. “Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame.” UK news in pictures 32 show all UK news in pictures 1/32 13 November 2016 Queen Elizabeth II lays a wreath during the annual Remembrance Sunday Service at the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, England Getty 2/32 13 November 2016 The Prince of Wales arrives at the Guards' Chapel in Wellington Barracks, London for a service and to lay a wreath at the Guards' Memorial for the Welsh Guards' Regimental Remembrance Sunday PA wire 3/32 13 November 2016 British Prime Minister Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn Leader of the Labour Party and Angus Robertson, Deputy Leader of the Scottish National Party with former British Prime Minister's David Cameron, Tony Blair and Sir John Major during the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in London, Britain EPA 4/32 13 November 2016 Prime Minister Theresa May, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron, and Westminster Leader of the Scottish National Party Angus Roberston take part in the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in Westminster, central London Reuters 5/32 13 November 2016 Veterans wait on Horse Guards Parade for the start of the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in Westminster, central London Reuters 6/32 13 November 2016 People across the UK gathered to pay tribute to service personnel who have died during conflicts, as part of the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremonies ge 7/32 13 November 2016 Members of Scotland's armed forces and veterans gather to commemorate and pay respect to the sacrifice of service men and women who fought in the two World Wars and subsequent conflicts in Fort William, Scotland Getty 8/32 12 November 2016 The 689th Lord Mayor of the City of London Andrew Parmley waves from his carriage during The Lord Mayor's Show Getty 9/32 12 November 2016 The Lord Mayor procession passes by St Pauls Cathedral in London EPA 10/32 12 November 2016 Spectators watch as the Lord Mayor of the City of London's carriage arrives outside the Royal Courts of Justice during the Lord Mayor's Show in London, England Getty 11/32 12 November 2016 The Lord Mayor's Show, now in its 801st year, makes its way from the City of London to the Royal Courts of Justice today in a display of pageantry featuring a 6,500 strong procession Getty 12/32 12 November 2016 Participants of the Lord Mayor's Show parade past St Paul's Cathedral Getty Images 13/32 9 November 2016 Dr. Christopher Moran, Chairman Co-operation Ireland, Arlene Foster, First Minister of Northern Ireland, Queen Elizabeth II, Martin McGuinness, Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland and Frances Fitzgerald, Minister of Justice and Equality Gov of Ireland, attend a Co-Operation Ireland Reception at Crosby Hall in London, England.

As such, the company plans to phase out support for the apps on Windows, Mac and Linux over the next couple of years. While admitting that packaged apps are used by just 1 percent of users of the three platforms, Google says that the decision comes after a drive to integrate the feature of apps into web standards. Chrome apps will live on in Chrome OS "for the foreseeable future", but a wind-down timetable has been set out for everyone else. Nothing is changing immediately. But come late 2016, only Chrome OS users will be able to access newly published apps. There are no plans to hide existing apps from users, and updates will still be available for them. The ball really starts to get rolling in the second half of 2017 when Windows, Mac and Linux users will lose access to the apps in the Chrome Web Store. It seems as though it will still be possible to sideload apps at this stage as Google goes on to say that "in early 2018, users on these platforms will no longer be able to load Chrome apps". In a blog post announcing that the plug is due to be pulled on Chrome apps for most platforms, Google says: We believe it’s time to begin the evolution away from the Chrome apps platform. There are two types of Chrome apps: packaged apps and hosted apps. Today, approximately 1% of users on Windows, Mac and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps, and most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps. We will be removing support for packaged and hosted apps from Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux over the next two years. Apps will continue to be supported on Chrome OS for now, but the message to Windows, Linux and Mac users is clear: it's time to move on: On Windows, Mac, and Linux, we encourage developers to migrate their Chrome apps to the web. Developers who can’t fully move their apps to the web can help us prioritize new APIs to fill the gaps left by Chrome apps. In the short term, they can also consider using a Chrome extension or platforms such as Electron or NW.js. For anyone using Chrome OS, there is a more immediate change -- but one that has less of an impact on users. As noted by OMG Chrome, there's a new Cortana-inspired icon to enjoy.

Collaborating with Queen and Enosis VR, Google calls the production "a journey through frontman Freddie Mercury's subconscious mind." Stylistically, the experience is a surrealistic and psychadelic journey that does indeed resonate with Mercury and Queen's persistently joyful and ebullient lyrics and sound. The experience follows the flow of the song, however, rising and falling with the melodic changes that accompany it.

The animal was snapped by Google's camera as it grazed by the water at Coe Fen in Cambridge. And weirdly it was given the same privacy treatment as humans get when its face was blurred. The Guardian's David Shariatmadari tweeted the photo out on Monday and it has since been shared more than 9,000 times. He wrote: "Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously." Tim Bale replied: “Had better milk that one for all it's worth." The blurred cow was spotted on Google Street View in the Coe Fen area of Cambridge (Photo: Google Street View) Google admitted its technology had been a little "overzealous" and mistook the bovine creature for a person due to movement sensors.

"Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame." When Google launched in 2007 technology that automatically blurs people's faces was introduced to help combat privacy concerns.

The Coalition for Better Ads was announced by Google at a digital advertising trade show in Germany and is a direct response to the rise of adblockers. The group wants to score ads based on e.g their size and how much bandwidth they consume. Also usage of tracking pixels and the effect on pageload times is taken in account. Based on these criteria the advertisements receive a rating. Publishers that participate in the Coalition for Better Ads will only show advertisements that score above a certain threshold. This should make sure participating websites no longer show bad and annoying advertisements. The rating system should also become a new standard for online advertising. The first version of the standard is expected for the fourth quarter of this year. Besides Google also Unilever, The Washington Post, DMA, GroupM, Procter & Gamble and the European Publishers Council are part of the coalition.   Related Forum: Latest News Headlines Related Tags: google adblock Broadband provider starts to show TV commercials based on viewing and surfing habits Shuttle NC01U Mini PC Review Google Ads exec: Popularity of adblockers caused by ads with terrible user experience Cookie Policy DrageMester Retired Moderator Posted on: 15 Sep 16 19:58 Funnily enough, another news article posted just after this one, shows why people are going to continue using adblockers even if the quality of legit ads is improved: Zero-day leak in Internet Explorer and Edge actively abused since 2014 Quote: The zero-day leak in Internet Explorer and Edge, that was patched last Patch Tuesday, has been actively used to infect internet users since 2014. Users were infected by viewing malcious advertisements. 2 Agree Seán Senior Administrator & Reviewer Posted on: 15 Sep 16 21:16 Ad banners should be no more than a static image (or MP4 video clip for higher paid ads) that when clicked takes the user to the advertiser's website, nothing more.  This would make it incredibly difficult to deliver malicious advertisements as the malicious ads would need to find vulnerabilities in the JPEG, MP4, etc. file formats used by browsers. At present, most banners are iframes that are effectively a full-blown webpage including JavaScript, cookies, etc. loaded within the banner slot, which is a incredible waste of resources just to display an advert.  Just try inspecting the HTML source for an banner and it's crazy the amount of code and JavaScript most banners use, often more than the webpage they are displayed in.  1 Agree TSJnachos117 MyCE Resident Posted on: 15 Sep 16 21:33 Finally! I literally thought this day would never come. After all, many corporations in the tech industry have gone out of their way to not listen to their own customers. Online advertising has gotten too out of control, and needs to be pulled back somewhat. Now all we need to hear is that online advertisers are willing to take DNT headers into consideration. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that these advertisers are going to start taking Do Not Track into account. Although DNT was intended as a way to opt-out of surveillance, it appears that Google and others are going to ignore it as they always have. Also, it doesn't appear they're going to do anything about ads that slow your computer down. You don't need a whole lot of bandwidth to download a RAM-hungry or CPU-hungry JS script. Still, at least they're doing something about tracking pixels. That's a very good start unto itself. They are also going to do something about ads that suck up users' bandwidth, which a much-needed course of action. Improved pageload times is always a good thing. 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

The Dalles Area Chamber of Commerce has been campaigning to get local business on the Google map for over a year, and are now offering a series of Tech Talks, offering information and one on one help from Google employees. Above, a T-shirt and other items of “swag” distributed during events by the chamber. Photo by Mark Gibson. By Mark Gibson As of Thursday, September 15, 2016 Sign in to favorite this Discuss Comment, Blog about Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter The Dalles Area Chamber of Commerce and Google are launching a first of its kind educational series for the community called “Tech Talk” on Oct. 5. The idea was sparked at this year’s Googlefest at the Fort Dalles Readiness Center, which introduced members of the business, nonprofit and educational community to Google tools and techniques that might benefit their work. “People were looking for one-on-one follow up,” explained chamber marketing and communication coordinator Tiffany Hardin. “They were introduced to all the tools, but were asking, ‘How do I implement that?’” The new Tech Talks, planned for every four months, are designed to help local individuals, nonprofits and small businesses learn how to take advantage of available technology. Attendees will learn tips and tricks for using free Google tools such as Gmail, Calendar, Hangouts and Google Docs. The first Tech Talk is scheduled for Wednesday, Oct. 5, from 5 to 6:30 p.m. and will focus on Gmail. The event will be held at Route 30 Bottles and Brews, 317 E. Second Street, The Dalles, with happy hour food and drink available for purchase. Attendees should plan to bring their laptop for this hands-on event, Hardin said. After a presentation on Gmail, local Google staff will be available for one-on-one assistance and support. The chamber has already co-hosted two “Google my Business” workshops, and the Tech Talk events will also give those attending the opportunity to validate their business and get it on the Google map of The Dalles. “Getting your business on the map involves an approval process through Google by proving ownership, which allows business owners to edit the information presented by Google. “It gives people the opportunity to keep their information updated,” she said. “Your business will have a pin, you are right there on their map, when someone looks at a Google map of town.” The two Google map workshops attracted about 60 people each. The process can be done online, which combines online information with postal confirmation, but if you provide proof you own your business at a workshop you can be approved on the spot, Hardin explained. Business owners must bring original proof of ownership documents such as utility bills, tax letters, and/or business registration certificates. Registered agents of the business may also bring photo identification and have ownership verified through the Secretary of State’s website. Attendees should RSVP by Sept. 30 with TheDallesChamber.com. The subsequent Tech Talk is scheduled for Jan. 11, 2017, with the location to be announced. Future events are planned to span a range of time frames, so those who can attend in the morning, at noon or evening will have a chance to attend an event that fits their schedule. October’s topic, Gmail, was one a lot of people were asking about that during Googlefest, Hardin said. Hardin added that she has had a lot of positive feedback from the business community on the chamber/Google sponsored events. “Our local business community is very responsive to this,” she said. Over time, the chamber and the business community have developed a strong relationship with Google, which operates a growing data center at the Port of The Dalles. “We have an amazing relationship with them, they are super open to any idea we might have,” she said. “It’s great having them in our backyard, and willing to work with the community.” The Dalles may even help start a bigger trend: “We will be the first community to offer this,” she said of the Tech Talk forum. She believes the one-on-one portion of the event will be especially helpful. “It’s not every day you get to sit down with a Google professional to get help.” More like this story ‘Googlefest’ explores online tools Google offers workshops Google reveals newest data center Google is a part of the community, growth should be supported Google breaks new ground in The Dalles Comments Use the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.

At Google I/O in May, the company announced it would be bringing a device-local safe browsing application programming interface (API) to developers, and that day has finally arrived. But what is a ‘device-local safe browsing API’? It is basically a way for developers to use the same protections that Google uses on the web and it determines whether a link is safe to visit or if it has been previously marked as a known threat on Google’s list. Examples of sites that would not be considered safe include social phishing websites that attempt to get login information from you, as well as sites that host malware. The API is aimed at being extremely easy to implement within an app. Related: Google sneaks in upgrade of Safe Browsing API, says it’s been guarding some users for months “Since our initial launch we’ve shown hundreds of millions of warnings, actively warning many millions of mobile users about badness before they’re exposed to it,” Google employees wrote in a blog post. “We look forward to all Android developers extending this same protection to their users, too.” Of course, as a mobile API, it is also built to keep battery use and bandwidth consumption as low as possible. Another great thing about the new API is that it is being rolled out in the latest version of Google Play Services, meaning all developers can take advantage of it and  it can be used on older devices — even those dating back as far as Android 2.3. The API also uses the latest version of the Safe Browsing protocol, which basically means that it acts as quickly as possible — also saving on cellular data. Apps using the API are able to specify exactly which threats to avoid — malware, phishing, or both.
